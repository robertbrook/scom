	<p>[MR MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Crime and Punishment(Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a point of order, the hon. Gentleman seeks guidance from me, not the Minister. His question has nothing to do with what is before us this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In our previous debate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) requested that I meet Enable. I shall be doing that at 2 o'clock this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 10</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>WAITING TIMES BETWEEN CRIMINAL CHARGE AND BEGINNING OF TRIAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>—(1) The Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament not later than 30th June in each year, a report listing, for criminal cases disposed of in—
	<ol>
	<li>the district courts;</li>
	<li>the sheriff courts; and</li>
	<li>the High Court,</li>
</ol>
respectively, the average number of days which elapsed between the charge being preferred and the beginning of the trial.</p>
	<p>(2) A report under subsection (1) above shall include breakdowns of the periods between the charge being preferred and the beginning of the trial by reference to the category of offence, on such basis as the Secretary of State may determine.'.—[	<i>Mr. Davidson.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that the Secretary that the Secretary of State produces statistics showing the length of delays between the time when a charge is preferred and the beginning of a trial. By that I mean when a charge is laid by the police which informs an individual that he or she is being charged, rather than any step in the legal process. I am conscious that there is scope for ambiguity, which will be cleared up by the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
when he accepts the new clause in principle and reintroduces it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would speed up the system. The Government have based the entire Bill on a false premise. Their argument is that tougher sentences will serve as a deterrent. I believe that a greater deterrent to criminal behaviour is the certainty of being speedily punished. Substantial delays in Scotland between the charging of a person and their being brought to court undermine the credibility of the entire system. A large number of people in my area have been charged with offences but have not appeared in court. The perception spreads throughout the community that they are almost immune from prosecution or action being taken against them, which undermines the credibility and morale of the police and certainly undermines the willingness of people to come forward and provide evidence against those who are charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer in particular to correspondence that I received recently from Govan housing association, a local organisation which provides housing through the housing association movement in an extremely difficult part of my constituency. It said in its letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I'm not sure if you can help, we have a problem. The attached correspondence makes the problem clear. Members, I'm sure, would willingly meet the costs, if the police and courts were capable of producing sustainable results. Unfortunately that is not the case, which is a matter of real concern.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Some parts of Govan are developing into no-go and difficult-to-let areas, which results in further lost income, accelerating the spiral of decline. Your assistance in arriving at a conclusion to this problem would be appreciated."</p></blockquote>
Of course, it is not my assistance that is needed but that of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing association goes on to spell out in considerable detail how, over the past few months and years, forced entry by the police to premises in the area while carrying out raids and making arrests has meant that it has been out by hundreds if not thousands of pounds because it has been left to carry the financial burden of that. It said in its letter that it would be quite happy to carry that burden if it believed that anything would happen as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association gave me a list of addresses, some of which have been raided by the police several times, incurring costs in each case—£436.67 in one case and £328.39 in another, as well as £314.33 due to several break-ins by the police and several sets of repairs. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association has in the past accepted and absorbed all of the costs arising from lost rental, forced entries…in the hope that benefits would accrue to the community at large. Operation Diamond, a high profile operation, earlier this year resulted in direct costs to the Association of £3,500 and indirect staff costs of a further £500.00. Persons involved in this operation are still on the street, and, as far as we are aware still indulging in the business/activities which prompted the operation in the first instance. The operation from the Associations point of view is, or could be, an exercise in futility."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association has demonstrated its willingness to co-operate with the assist the police in their work. If there is a price to be paid, there has to be a successful and measurable end result. At the present time this appears not to be the case."</p></blockquote>
On pursuing the issue with the association, it spelt out to me a number of circumstances and cases and told me of a specific case where a house was raided at the beginning of February by the police. I understand that drugs were found and that the person involved was charged. In March, the police returned, closed the entire street, raided a number of houses and arrested and charged the same people having broken into their house by forced entry. Again, nothing has happened through the court system. In October, the police broke into the house again, arrested the people involved and charged them once more. On three occasions, those individuals have had their house broken into, incurring the appropriate costs to the housing association, and charges have been laid, yet nothing has happened. Is it any wonder that people in the Govan area wonder whether the Government are serious about maintaining law and order? People who are known to be involved in the drugs trade have been charged and police have carried out their duties as far as they could, but nothing whatsoever has happened to those individuals. They are back on the streets and still involved in drug dealing. I hope that the Minister will suggest that something will be done about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association has produced a number of other circumstances where exactly the same thing happened and I have several other cases from other parts of my constituency. It seems that there is a genuine problem that requires to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause intends to have published the figures for delays in the court system in the hope that comparison of those figures by offence would encourage best practice throughout the land. We publish statistics on education and health, which have, in some circumstances, resulted in improved behaviour by the relevant institutions, so it seems that the same thing should apply here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that statistics are produced. The difficulty for those of us who are lay people is that the statistics from the Scottish Court Service, for example, are, in some cases, almost impenetrable. Moreover, they only begin from when a case started its legal process rather than going back a stage to the point where the police laid the charge. That allows for a delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even using the figures, the Scottish Court Service's annual report for 1995–96 suggests on page 39 that the average summary criminal waiting period in Glasgow between June 1995 and March 1996 ranged from 24 to 35 weeks—virtually nine months delay. Clearly, in those circumstances, a number of cases will involve much greater delays. I hope that the Minister is willing
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
to accept the new clause in principle, to improve it as it requires and then to use the statistics to force changes on the Scottish legal system to produce the results that my community wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the job of Members of Parliament to immerse ourselves in the work of the legal system in order to tell people working in it exactly how they should do their jobs. Our role is to identify difficulties and suggest to the system that there must be improvements. There must be improvements in this important aspect of the Scottish legal system. I hope that the Minister will accept that, and I hope to hear that he accepts the new clause. I remind him of the Secretary of State's answer to a question from me in the Chamber the other day, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I agree with the hon. Gentleman: there are unacceptable delays in the system. The legal aid system partly encourages delay, which is one reason shy we want to reform it. The hon. Gentleman is right to mention the importance of the punishment being administered as soon as possible and to say that people who have committed serious crimes should not be allowed to be released into the community."</p></blockquote>
He went on to make a number of other points before concluding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman pinpoints a matter that causes considerable concern in communities the length and breadth of Scotland."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 November 1996; Vol. 285, c. 972.]</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that the identification and the solution of the issue should be a matter on which both major parties could agree. I look forward therefore to the Minister's conversion to our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Gentleman. I am aware of his concerns about the provision of information held on police computers, which he raised earlier. Inquiries are currently being made with Strathclyde police into the various points that he has raised with me and I will write to him soon on those matters which, in part or in whole, relate to his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the speed of justice, I can inform the hon. Gentleman that the Criminal Justice Forum, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set up, intends to look at delays. Due care must be taken to prepare cases but any delay should be minimised
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has shown a keen interest recently in the period between an accused being charged by a police officer and the accused's appearance at trial. We are as concerned as the hon. Gentleman to ensure that those who are accused of crimes are brought to trial with all possible speed. Justice delayed is justice denied. It is important to know how long it takes to convict the guilty or acquit the innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have tried to explain to the hon. Gentleman in answering his recent parliamentary questions, the full information necessary to answer his queries is not collected centrally. Some information is collected by the Lord Advocate's Department and relates to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
time in summary between the fiscal receiving a report from the police and the service of a complaint. Information is also available on the time between the service of the complaint and the pleading diet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time between pleading diet and the start of the trial is collected separately by the Scottish Court Service, or from the local authorities that are responsible for the operation of the district courts. However, there is no central collection of the information. Information is generally only available in respect of summary proceedings because of the strict time limits which operate in solemn cases. However, a critical stage in the equation, that of the period between charge and report to the procurator fiscal, is not monitored by every police force in Scotland. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that such details would be of interest, although figures would be at a general level by giving averages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the need for a statutory provision as proposed by the hon. Gentleman. He is aware that, where statistics exist, the Government will provide them, subject to the Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1988. Figures on the time periods from the receipt of the report by the fiscal to the pleading diet are regularly more available. I would expect that, if we are able to provide the figures for the period between charge and report, they, too, will and should be put in the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot at this stage give an undertaking about a breakdown by offence. Those more expert in the operation of the respective information systems would have assess to what extent that is possible. However, I undertake to write to hon. Members about those matters in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to consider with the police how best to secure that information, because I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) that it would be useful. We are seeking the views of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) about the best way to provide it. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister's response. He suggested that the information is not collected centrally in the form that I want; but I knew that already. His parliamentary answers have been masterpieces of the civil servant's art inasmuch as they have told me nothing whatsoever that I was not capable of finding out for myself. Presumably, that was the intention behind them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to accept that justice delayed is justice denied. In this matter, the Government are in danger of talking tough and carrying a feather duster—they are unwilling to produce the information because it shows the weakness with which they previously dealt with the matter. They are, I think, afraid to provide the information because it would show the
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
contempt with which they have been treating people in my constituency and elsewhere, who feel under siege from drug dealers and violent criminals. The Government's response—they said that they will discuss the matter with other interested parties, including police officers—while welcome, does not mean that they intend to introduce that which could be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be much happier about withdrawing the new clause if the Minister said that he intended to bring forward proposals after discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland). If he intends only to have discussions with the association but offers no commitments to do anything further I shall press the new clause to a vote. I hope that he intends to come back with proposals that will translate into new working practices, if not into new legislation. That would provide the evidence that I want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not say that he accepted that the publication of the statistics relating to grouped offences, on a court-by-court basis, rather than to individual offences, on an offence-by-offence basis, would encourage best practice. I hope that he accepts that principle. Members of Parliament accept that that system operates very well in many ways in the national health service. Adjusting statistics so that they take account of deprivation and are sorted by subject has also worked well in the education system. I hope that the Minister will give me the assurances that I asked for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must repeat to the hon. Gentleman what I have already said: I cannot at this stage give a guarantee about the breakdown of offences because we have to ascertain the extent to which it is possible to provide them. I am happy to reaffirm that it is our aim to provide that information—I accept the principle that it is desirable to provide it. I shall consider with the police the best way of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we are seeking the views of the chief police officers about the steps that could or should be taken to provide that information. Practicalities and the extent to which the present information system is up to date must be taken into account when assessing what is possible. I do not think that the new clause should be added to the Bill, but I shall take forward the hon. Gentleman's proposal. As I said earlier, justice delayed is justice denied. As much information as possible should be in the public domain, and the amount of information should be increased year on year rather than kept at its present level. I am basically sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's comments. The matter will be taken forward, and I shall write to him about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>HARASSMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>
	<li>`—(1) In this section, "harassment" means engaging in a course of conduct whereby a person—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>follows, loiters near, observes or approaches another person;</li>
	<li>telephones or contacts by electronic means or otherwise another person in such a way as to be reasonably likely to cause that other person alarm, distress or fear for his safety or for that of one or more other persons; and "harass" shall be construed accordingly.</li>
</ol>
	<li>A person who harasses another person is guilty of an offence.</li>
	<li>A person guilt of an offence under this section may be sentenced on conviction or indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or a fine or both, or on summary conviction to imprisonment to a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale or both.</li>
	<li>A constable may arrest without warrant a person whom he has reasonable cause to suspect to have committed or to be about to commit an offence of harassment.</li>
	<li>It shall be a defence to charge under this section if the person charged proves that the accused did not know and had no reasonable cause to believe that his behaviour was likely to cause alarm, distress or fear for personal safety under subsection (1) above.'.—[	<i>Mrs. Fyfe.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It gives me great pleasure to move the new clause, which I hope will be included in the Bill. It would introduce a new definition of harassment into Scottish law. Those of us who have been following the matter for some time know that the Government have, again and again, declared that breach of the peace was a sufficient provision to deal with all forms of such harassment. Under breach of the peace, it was possible for a person to be punished with a light sentence, but it could also involve a sentence of several years. It is only in recent weeks that the Government seem to have realised that the breach of the peace provisions are not adequate to cover the case and have shown some willingness to reconsider. I hope, therefore, that the new clause will be seen as a helpful move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harassment does not only involve following someone around and consistently putting them in fear by following them home. It could be a case of telephoning or contacting by electronic means or otherwise—there are various ways in which such stalking can be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a few days ago, there were newspaper reports of a case down south in which a business man sent a middle-aged woman a miniature cardboard coffin. On other occasions, he sent her offensive presents and literature through the post. The newspaper account goes on to describe the way in which the man's
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"relentless pursuit of the terrified woman on no less than 300 occasions left her emotionally scarred for life."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newspaper quotes the woman's feelings:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
"I was reduced to tears and to fears. I felt distressed and disturbed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She was absolutely devastated when she received a brochure and an order form for a tombstone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such cases appear in the newspapers quite frequently and we seem to be hearing more and more about them. I do not know whether such cases are coming to light more because women are speaking up about them more—usually women are the victims of this crime, but, of course, a man may also be the victim. However, it may be that reading newspaper accounts of such cases have inspired some sick characters to copy the behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harassment can take various forms. I have know a woman for many years who has been harassed by a man who persistently writes her letters; he started he week after her husband's funeral. They are not threatening letters: he does not send her cardboard coffins or brochures for tombstones, but the sheer persistence of unwanted letters has become very distressing to this woman. It has got to the point where she dreads picking up her mail in the morning in case she sees his handwriting on the envelope. He has phoned a friend of hers, after she had had lunch with that friend, to say, "I see that she is looking well these days." All this may seem harmless, but it is making this woman feel that she cannot go anywhere without being observed and wondering how she can have any peace in her life. The worst thing that happened in his case was an injunction to stop sending the letters. There was no sentence of any kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that example is a sufficient outline for the Minister to respond to my urgent plea to him this morning. This matter should be taken far more seriously then it is at the moment. There are far too many cases in our courts in Scotland where someone has reported cases such as I have briefly described this morning, and the offenders have received a tap on the wrist from the sheriff, with a very light sentence which does not show how serious and distressing the matter is and how it can utterly wreck someone's life as they have to put up with it for months or, indeed, years. I certainly hope that Conservative Members will be willing to accept the helpful new clause and to ensure that something is written into the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that a new statutory criminal offence of 'harassment' is not necessary in Scotland. Any conduct that is likely to cause alarm, annoyance or upset will already be criminal as the common law offence of breach of the peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Breach of the peace is a broad and flexible offence. It is not necessary for the victim to have suffered harm or for the accused to have intended that result. As a common law offence, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment for a conviction on indictment in the High Court. Therefore, no changes are required to Scottish criminal law in this regard.

	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
However, we recognise that there are difficulties for victims of stalkers to gain adequate protection from the civil courts. In October, we announced that measures would be introduced in Scotland to create a new legal right to be free from harassment. That would cover some of the circumstances mentioned by the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criminal courts would also be able to impose a non-harassment order immediately after having convicted someone of an offence that involved harassment. Members of the Committee will be aware that the Protection from Harassment Bill was published on 5 December. It will create in Scotland a new legal right to be free from harassment. It will enable a victim of harassment to apply to the court for a non-harassment order, breach of which would be a criminal offence, attracting up to five years' imprisonment. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary and I urge hon. Members not to press it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister could further enlighten us. Does not someone who brings a case to a civil court incur costs, so that if a person is not eligible for legal aid, he or she will not be able to bring a case because he or she will not have enough money to pay a lawyer's fees? Many women will not be helped by such a move because they will be unable to afford to pay lawyer's fees and will not be eligible for legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is raising another matter: whether the legal aid cut-off point is at the appropriate level. Obviously, if someone cannot afford to go to court, he or she can apply for legal aid, which may be granted, depending on the person's circumstances. But there will always be a group of people who are just above the cut-off point, and whether it is appropriate to take legal action depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Of course, if a person wins a legal action, he or she will receive expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has confirmed precisely his objection. But the fact is that many women are neither so impoverished that they would be eligible for legal aid, nor so well-off that they can afford lawyer's fees. Typically, women earn far less money than men, so are more likely to be unfairly burdened by such inadequate provisions. I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be no costs involved if the criminal court imposes a non-harassment order. Under Scots common law, the criminal courts already have powers to impose sentences of up to life imprisonment. Indeed, some of the criticisms that have been made in the past have not been directed against the common law of Scotland; they have been directed against the handling of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
particular case, which is a matter for the hon. Members concerned to take up with the Lord Advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not a criminal offence? The Government have moved on to the Labour party's ground on this issue. Six months ago, I asked the Government to introduce an offence of stalking, but the Secretary of State said that there was no need to do so. Indeed, the Lord Advocate wrote to me and, more or less, suggested that my request traduced Scots law because the common law in Scotland was its strength. I agree that the common law is a strength, but the Minister says that the offence of breach of the peace can cover the entire criminal spectrum. Let the Minister consider the figures for sentences imposed for breach of the peace; he will find that breach of the peace is considered by the courts to be a relatively minor offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem and the Government have still to tackle that issue. We welcome the Government going halfway, but they have only gone halfway, and perhaps made the situation more complicated in the process, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said. So why do they not go the whole way, and recognise that stalking is an important issue and that something must be done about it in Scots law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friends in pleading with the Minister to show some common sense and compassion. The Government are hiding behind the common law and insulting many women in Scotland who suffer a breach of the peace. We are talking not about a remonstration between neighbours or a fallout in a pub but about people who are constantly under threat, usually from males, and whose lives are made absolute hell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a case in my constituency recently when two known rapists—they had been convicted of rape—were harassing a young woman in a village. I have referred to that village several times in the House as the village of hell. The woman was terrified by knocks on the door at 2 o'clock in the morning by a father and son, both of whom had been convicted of rape at different times. The son constantly harasses the young woman and her boyfriend is now so afraid that he will not come to the village to visit his partner. That is how bad it has become. Are the Government suggesting that that is a common law breach of the peace? It is difficult enough for that young woman to have the courage to tell someone about the problem and she has not got to the point where she is asking the police not to come around because she is so afraid. That is the lack of protection suffered by some people in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is so complacent as to be insulting in his reference to common law. We need an advance in the law and the new clause recognises that something is happening in society when people pick on innocent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
victims, particularly women, and make their lives hell with constant inquiry or interference, or more threatening behaviour such as knocking on doors in the middle of the night when they are drunk and asking to be let in. That is not just breach of the peace; that is terrifying people and should be called harassment as least. If the Minister or his civil servants do not recognise that, they are ignoring the people of Scotland and deserve to be condemned for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill. He described two avenues that could be pursued under the Government's proposals for victims of such harassment. The first was that when another offence is involved, the criminal courts could impose a non-harassment order and there would be no need for legal and so on. That would require another offence to be involved and the offender would have to come before the criminal court for an offence other than harassment. That is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that a victim would have the right to apply for freedom from harassment through the civil courts. The Government are sending a dangerous message when they say that such harassment is a civil matter. It is not a civil matter to be decided in the same way as a dispute about a garden. It is a criminal matter if people are committing crimes against others. It is very important that the Government have the courage to send a message to people in the community that if they indulge in such behaviour, they are acting criminally. If the Government do not accept the new clause, they will send the wrong message to the wrong type of people. Many of those who indulge in such harassment do not think that they are doing something illegal or wrong. They think that it is acceptable to behave in that way. The Government will endorse that view if they fail to back the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem does not affect only women. Many hon. Members will have received threatening, anonymous letters. I had one about my son who appeared briefly in the local paper. Immediately afterwards, a death threat was sent anonymously. The problem affects men as well as women. I even had one myself from Inverness after I was elected in 1987—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It was anonymous and I am sure that the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) would not write to me anonymously. I was accused of being a pinko, scum, communist, nationalist appeaser—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are important because some people believe that such behaviour is sanctioned by society. The Government have waited far too long before sending out a message to the community that such behaviour is not only intolerable, but is criminal, and that anyone who indulges in it will face trial before the criminal courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was worried about being called pinko. As to the other terms, he probably did not worry too much about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill suggested that the offences were not considered criminal in Scotland, but my understanding of what my right hon. Friend the Minister said is that they are so considered in Scotland. That is why he will not go down that road. I do not want duplication of legislation, but I want the problem tackled. I agree with the hon. Lady in many respects, but duplication of legislation is not the way forward. The courts are not treating the problem seriously enough. Will my right hon. Friend comment on guidance given to sheriffs and others about the issue, since there is definitely a deficiency at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why we are sitting in Committee this morning if it is not to change legislation and to add to existing legislation. We are in grave danger of confusing a serious crime such as harassment with a crime such as breach of the peace. As a justice of the peace I often encountered breaches of the peace and I can assure the Committee that they were always treated as minor offences, usually warranting a £20—or, at worst, a £30—fine. Harassment is quite a different thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members have described cases that have happened in their constituencies. Hon. Members of both sides of the Committee could quote chapter and verse when it comes to harassment. We are certainly sending out the wrong message to the sort of people who harass others. The victims of harassment are, typically, young women but also young men and older people too. How many pensioners do we know who are harassed constantly for one thing or another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's duty to take the problem much more seriously, to put the provisions on the statue book and to tell those who harass others that they are not just a nuisance but are committing a criminal offence. We should not treat harassment as if it were only a nuisance that does not much matter. People who harass others are not pests and nuisances: we should be telling them that they are criminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister can see the strength of feeling on this subject among my hon. Friends and at least one Conservative Member. It is up to the Minister to explain why he is prepared to move only partially in the direction of allowing cases to be taken as civil court matters, since people could be denied the opportunity of so doing if their income does not stretch high enough to meet the costs. That could unfairly impact upon women—there may be a breach of equal opportunities legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out to my hon. Friends that we have all received nasty and threatening letters from time to time. We can laugh and joke about them, as in the case mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
East (Mr. McAllion). However, what must it be like to receive such letters all the time—for months and years on end? That would distress all of us and make us feel that we were threatened, which is exactly what is happening to too many of our fellow citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that harassment is a criminal matter in Scotland; yet, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) said, it is not treated as a criminal matter in the courts where far too many light sentences are imposed. If the Minister is minded to provide guidance to the courts not to treat such cases too lightly, why is he not taking the opportunity to do so? Why has he not raised the issue during the months and years in which the problem has been aired and debated, both outside and inside the House and in another place? He could have made such moves but he has nodded agreement with the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) about what should be done. It is clear that the Minister is not taking the issue seriously enough and we need some answers from him this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one issue on which I should like to ask the Minister to comment. We are all agreed that breach of the peace is a wide and flexible charge in Scotland. The Minister is right to say that it is ultimately possible to receive a life sentence for it in theory—in practice, of course, it does not happen. However, one issue has concerned me, particularly in relation to an area of law such as harassment which, in Scotland, would currently be charged under breach of the peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A difficulty arises when someone is being sentenced following a conviction. The sheriff has before him the schedule of previous convictions. Breaches of the peace are logged in the schedule as nothing other than that. The only thing to go by to ascertain the nature or the seriousness of the offence is the sentence, which may be minor—perhaps a fine. It is possible for fiscals of the advocate-depute to ascertain in advance details of previous convictions so that at least it is known what comprised a particular offence, but in my experience that does not happen often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People often have long schedules of previous convictions, many of them for breach of the peace, containing slightly escalating fines and/or community service orders. There is no indication therein that a pattern of behaviour may be developing, but in cases of harassment it is important to spot such a development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our system of drawing up schedules of conviction there is no obvious way to alert people to what is happening. The hon. Member for Paisley, North is right to say that breaches of the peace are viewed as relatively minor unless it can be argued on a point of detail, that the offence was serious. Will the Minister comment on what is one of the biggest drawbacks of this flexible charge? It does not help in establishing an escalating pattern of behaviour and many people who are involved in that area of criminal behaviour are worried about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the hon. Lady's last point. The extract of previous convictions goes before the judge. She asked whether he should have before him not just the schedule, but specification of what a particular episode involved—harassment in this case. I am prepared to raise the matter with the Lord Advocate, whose responsibility that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must make it clear to the Committee that courts treat harassment cases seriously. For example, in Kilmarnock a male offender conducted himself in a disorderly manner and adopted a menacing attitude to a couple, having previously evinced malice and ill-will to the woman. He placed them in a state of terror and alarm, handcuffed himself to a tree and committed a breach of the peace. He received six months' imprisonment consecutive to another prison sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Aberdeen, over three days in 1995, a male offender conducted himself in a disorderly manner and delivered, or had delivered, a table, a cake and a birthday card for a woman. He placed her in a state of fear and alarm, and committed a breach of the peace. In that case, the sentence was only a £250 fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past four or five years, how many people have come before the courts for breach of the peace and received a sentence of one year or more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would need notice of that question—I will have to look up the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the objections this morning have been not to the law of Scotland, but to the sentencing patterns of judges. The underlying sentiment is that the judges have not been giving appropriate sentences for breaches of the peace involving harassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he needed notice of my question. I have looked at the figures: there have been one or two cases over five years. The number is minimal and the fact that a breach of the peace is seen as a relatively trivial offence—that is the kernel of our argument—contributes to what we have said. He should take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not need to be seen as trivial. My first case was about a trivial matter—a man had tweaked his father's ear because of an argument about the family will. That constituted a breach of the peace, and a £10 fine was imposed. That was a relatively trivial case, although it may not have seemed so trivial to those concerned. We are talking about something very much more serious in comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there were 16,000 cases in 1994–6 per cent. resulted in imprisonment, and 1 per cent. were taken on indictment. Those on indictment would have attracted, on average, a much heavier penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
I repeat what I said earlier to the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The criminal courts will have the power to make a non-harassment order immediately after having convicted someone of an offence involving harassment of a victim. A breach of this order will also be a criminal offence attracting the same maximum penalties. The courts can take the necessary action, having listened to all the circumstances. There have been many cases of six months' imprisonment being imposed; more could be imposed if the judge considers that appropriate. We shall be discussing new clause 21 later this morning: it provides for the Secretary of State to prescribe training courses for judges. Much of what has been said this morning is an argument not against the law of Scotland, but against the judges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell me where in the law of Scotland it is provided that it is a criminal offence to harass people in this manner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is covered by the common law of Scotland—the conduct complained about, and that of sending unacceptable letters containing threats, also constitute serious breaches of the peace, which the courts should take seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only express deep disappointment at the Minister's response. He told my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) that he would need notice of the question about how many such cases had resulted in a sentence of a year or longer. The Minister should know the answer off the top of his head if he took the matter as seriously as we do. It is the kind of information that he should have at his fingertips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We keep reading of cases in which the person accused has got off very lightly with a small fine or a sentence of a few weeks. That is not adequate. If the judges are treating such matters too lightly, something must be done about that. There is nothing to stop us changing the law of Scotland, quite apart from training judges, which we shall discuss later. But time presses this morning. I wish that we could debate this topic for longer, but unfortunately that cannot be done. I shall withdraw the new clause, but if the Minister will not change the law of Scotland, we shall, and we shall not be long about it, either. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 14, I shall be metaphorically tweaking the Minister's ear—not about money, but court blunders. I refer the Minister to a story that appeared in 	<i>The Herald</i> on 26 November, in which I am quoted. Keith Chisholm was leaving the dock at Glasgow sheriff court after being found not guilty by a jury of causing the death of a 14-year-old schoolboy who was knocked down by the car that he was driving. The article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sheriff Craig Henry noticed some of the jurors looked puzzled and asked them if there was something wrong. The jury forman said they had cleared Mr. Chisholm of causing the boy's death, but had found him guilty of dangerous driving.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Defence advocate Gerald Carroll said that the jury's not guilty verdict had been recorded and could not be changed."</p></blockquote>
The article goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sheriff Henry told the jury: 'If it is anyone's fault that you were not given the opportunity to have the alternative charge recorded, it is mine.'</p></blockquote>
Simply because that was not recorded, the case fell. That is a ridiculous situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a huge degree of common sense in the new clause. I should like the Minister to accept the new clause in the spirit in which it has been tabled. Patent miscarriages of justice have been created simply because of an inaccurate recording system in the court. That should not be allowed to happen. The law should be changed so that it is not a laughing stock. Will the Minister do something about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the reports in the press the other week concerning the confusion over a jury's verdict, I had expected an amendment from the hon. Member for Dumbarton. Indeed, he had given advance notice of it in the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about the confusion which arises from time to time in recording the verdict of juries. The case the other week and a previously reported case—Lees 	<i>v.</i> Her Majesty's Advocate in 1985, which gave rise to similar events—show that on occasions juries may be unclear as to the precise verdict they should be returning. Those occasions are few and far between, but when they occur they give rise to concern at the way in which the criminal justice system operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has therefore written to the Lord Justice-General to seek his views on what might be done to prevent such occurrences in future. My right hon. Friend has suggested that the Lord Justice General may wish to seek the view of the Criminal Courts Rules Council, which was established under the Criminal Procedure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
(Scotland) Act 1995. We thought that desirable since there are various mechanisms which could be employed to ensure that any confusion is avoided. Although it is a matter for the Lord Justice-General, he may consider that a practice note should be issued to the judiciary. An amendment to the Acts of Adjournal may be appropriate. It may be that to avoid confusion, the verdict of juries should be written down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the moment, I am not certain that a statutory change is called for. This area of law and procedure is far from straightforward. As to jurors' voting decisions, hon. Members are aware that the Thomson committee considered the issue in its second report. Attempts to devise a standard form were not fruitful and the Thomson committee recommended against routine disclosure of the votes of a jury. Similar problems may arise again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the issue of the number of votes required to secure a guilty verdict, we have been over this ground before. The Hon. Gentleman first tabled his amendment just over four years ago. When I responded to the proposal then I said that the Thomson committee had considered and rejected weighted voting. We consulted in 1994 on a range of issues concerning juries and verdicts. That included whether there should be a change in the voting arrangements, especially if the three-verdict system in Scotland were to be abolished. The clear message was there there was no call for a change. In responding to an amendment in an other place, the then Lord Advocate argued that there was no need for such a change. In that he was supported by the noble and learned Lord McCluskey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I cannot accept the hon. Member's new clause. I have some sympathy for dealing with the confusion which occasionally occurs over how juries record their verdict. When we receive a response to our inquiries of the Lord Justice-General, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will give careful consideration to what should be done. For the present and with that undertaking, I invite him to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is totally unacceptable. I gave the Minister notice in the press on 26 November 1996. Three weeks later, he is saying that it is a matter for the Lord Justice-General. There is an obvious miscarriage of justice and a similar matter arose in the High court in Glasgow in 1995. Two youths walked free from a charge of attempted murder when the foreman stated that the case had been found not proven when the jury had found them guilty. We are only asking for common sense to be introduced. Our involvement in discussing the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill has been encyclopaedic. Why cannot the Committee introduce a simple measure such as the new clause so that the provision is written down in case someone makes a slip of the tongue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Keith Chisholm, the jury was asked about the first charge, but the clerk did not read out the
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
second charge. The jury was hesitant, so it said nothing, with the result that that has been lost as well. It is unacceptable merely to say that it is a matter for the Lord Justice-General. Between now and Report, will the Minister get a letter to the Lord Justice-General and ensure that a decent amendment is tabled in January so that the problem can be sorted out and the law not brought into disrepute, as it manifestly is in these cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend comment on what would have happened if the situation had been in reverse—if the judge had heard declarations that had convicted Mr. Chisholm when the jury's intention was otherwise? Would there have been a pull-back from that? If there were a pull-back for the criminal, surely there should be a pull-back for justice on the other side too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<ol>
	<li>`.—(1) The Secretary of State may be regulations appoint in each Sheriff Court and District Court area an officer to be known as the victim information officer.</li>
	<li>The victim information officer shall supply on demand to any complainer in a summary complaint such information relating to the conviction, penalty or acquittal of the accused as may be requested.'.—[	<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause was tabled because of an incident relayed to me concerning Glasgow sheriff court. A young woman was assaulted in Glasgow by an individual who was subsequently found guilty of that assault. The victim was not in court to hear the result of the case but she phoned the clerk to find out what had happened. The clerk, or his representative, said that the individual had been found guilty. When she asked what sentence had been given she was told that the court had a policy of non-disclosure of sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to the new clause. Surely there should be a victim information requirement in the Bill. There is at present no duty on any court officer to inform victims of whether there has been a conviction or acquittal, or what penalty has been set. The amendment would impose such a duty. I know that I have mentioned this issue before, but I remind the Minister that victims need more information at different times—when someone has been apprehended and charged, when decisions are made which could affect a victim's safety or sense of security, when considerations have been made about a compensation order or when there is information about sentences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted the hon. Gentleman shares the Government's desire to improve the quality of services and information the victims of crime receive. Our intentions and plans for improvements in this matter are clearly spelt out in chapter 14 of the "Crime and Punishment" White Paper. Let me say straight away that I recognise that the Scottish Offices does not have a monopoly on concern for and knowledge about the needs of victims. I am, therefore, more than happy to give consideration to the argument that the hon. Gentleman has put forward. For the same reason, we utilise the results of professional research projects and liaise closely with organisations representing victims' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lot that is right about the new clause. Certainly, no one could quarrel with the objective of giving victims access to appropriate information about the outcome of their cases. I also think that the new clause is right to specify that the information should be given only where victims request it. to give information where it is not requested would be to waste resources and risk upsetting those victims who want to put the case behind them. Having said that, I am not persuaded that the new clause is the most appropriate means of achieving the objectives that we all share in this matter. My doubts concern the mechanism and the context of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may deal with the context point first, I remind the Committee that the Government's plans envisage both a national strategy for the provision of information to victims and a code of practice for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
use of statutory and voluntary bodies that routinely deal with victims. Both those proposals were put forward by Victim Support Scotland, Both were accepted by the Scottish Office and both are being developed in conjunction with the multi-agency victims steering group, which involves Victim Support Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the mechanism envisaged by the new clause, I have doubts whether that would offer the most appropriate way forward. It has been observed that the number of agencies involved in the criminal justice system lends itself to confusion. The introduction of yet another player—raising practical questions of liaison, access to information, management and accountability—should be contemplated only if we are certain that the desired service cannot be delivered by other means. I do not think that we have reached that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what I have said, hon. Members will realise that I am as keen as they are to make progress in this matter. We are agreed on the basic objectives, and their fulfilment is a priority. For the reasons that I have given, I do not think that at this stage we can be as certain as the new clause suggests we might about the most appropriate mechanism, but I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that I will take fully into account his thoughts and that they will be brought to the attention of the victims steering group. On that basis, I hope that he will agree to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I seek clarification regarding the time scale? When does the Minister intend to bring the proposals to whomever he intends to bring them? When does he expect them to come into operation?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I envisage a time scale of roughly two to three months.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the new clause is non-contentious and has support on both sides of the Committee. We have spent much of our time discussing sentencing and related matters. What concerns me most is that it is often not the sentences that are the main bone of contention but the fact that cases never come to court in the first place. The police often find themselves with one arm tied behind their backs: they know who is guilty of specific crimes but they find it difficult to persuade witnesses to come forward. I refer specifically to very serious criminal cases, such as murder and drugs-related cases, where witnesses are often frightened off long before the case comes to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, in my constituency there was a major murder trial. The witnesses' names were published in the local paper just after the accused were charged. Subsequently, those murder charges were proved and the people involved went down to serve very long sentences. The fact is however, that those witnesses were very frightened throughout the case—indeed,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
from the time at which the charges were made—because their names appeared in the local paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that case and others, I have had in my office many witnesses who have threatened to withdraw and have had to be taken into protective custody simply because it has been known locally that they are witnesses in a particular case. If we intend to proceed in criminal and major drugs trials, we must afford the witnesses anonymity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest for a minute that the defence be denied access to the witnesses, as that would be preposterous. However, those witnesses' names should never be released to the media or, if they are, they should never be published—certainly not by small, local newspapers, which tend to be where people's names appear. When they are known locally, they are very frightened. Often they are pursued not only during the case but after the case finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one case, a child was the main witness—in fact, she was one of the few witnesses to stand her ground throughout the case. Two years on from that trial, her family is still being moved and is now in its sixth house, which is not yet permanent. That family has split up because of the pressure. The child's father was pursued by relatives of the people who were convicted of that crime—probably because the relevant names continuously appeared in newspapers—and was so badly beaten up that he lost an eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to encourage witnesses to come forward—most cases depend heavily on witnesses coming forward—we must give them some protection: their names should not be published and it should not be possible to point them out in the street forevermore. The danger is that witnesses get frightened before a case comes to trial and they withdraw their evidence. The new clause would go some way towards protecting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Paisley, North has set out the case for her new clause in this important area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the witness in our criminal justice system is integral to its success. If witnesses did not come forward, prosecutions would grind to a halt. Our system depends on those who see crimes being committed coming forward, as part of their civic or professional duty, to report what they saw, first to the police and then, if necessary, to the courts. Unfortunately, the problem of intimidation appears to be growing, and there is now no doubt that it is becoming a serious problem for the police. That is why, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced yesterday, we are making £210,000 available over the next three years to help the police fund witness protection schemes. I hope that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
demonstrates to the hon. Lady that we take the matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the measures being considered to protect witnesses who are due to give evidence in court are the non-disclosure of personal details and the provision of new identities. Those measures are aimed at minimising the effect of intimidation and harassment of witnesses, which should give the public greater confidence is assisting the police and the courts in their battle against crime. The Strathclyde pilot scheme for witness protection, which was launched in August, is the first such scheme in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well understand the hon. Lady's concerns, but I do not think that the new clause is the solution. for example, it would put an end to the reporting of crime and investigative journalism as we now know it. It would also stop the transmission on the 10 o'clock news of eyewitness reports of any event that might be considered to be a serious crime. No editor or publisher would wish to risk prosecution by transmitting the identity of anyone against the possibility that he or she might be called as a witness in a solemn trial. It would bring to an end in Scotland programmes such as "Crimewatch UK", at least in relation to the reporting of cases that might appear before a Scottish court. The new clause might also prevent positive publicity about a case where, for example, a kidnap had occurred or a child had gone missing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the new clause. I must stress that in doing so I am not unsympathetic to its general aim or to her anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, may I make the general point that a witness can give his address as being care of a local police station,—and that is frequently done under existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's naivety in these matters sometimes astounds me. Giving a police station as one's address does not in a small community make one anonymous. In most cases, the witnesses will be well known in their local community—I refer in particular to drugs trials, where witnesses are often angels with dirty faces: they have not always been innocent, and are known locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's statement that some money will be made available for witness protection. However, the sum involved seems to be very small. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say that that sum would enable the police to change people's identity and to move them to another community. Often people do not want to change their identity. They have roots in their community and, if they have had the courage to come forward in a trial, they should be safe living in their community. Increasingly, witnesses are becoming the victims: they are the people who are being removed from their society, rather than the criminal who is causing the problems in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Lady's comments. Is she suggesting that, once someone has been convicted of a crime following the evidence of the witness, something should be added on to that sentence stating, "Never again will this witness live within a hundred miles of this particular location"? If not, what positive suggestion is the hon. Lady making to deal with the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has only to read the new clause to know what I am suggesting. All that I am suggesting is that the witnesses' names are not published and are not given to the media. The witnesses should be able to retain a certain amount of anonymity. Obviously, there will be some speculation as to who the witnesses are and the people defending themselves will know who the witnesses are. however, it should not be public information and witnesses' names should not be continually published leading up to the trial or as the trial proceeds because that is what is frightening witnesses off. They are frightened of being identified and being pointed out, sometimes in very rough communities. Most of the witnesses will not live in the mansions of this world; they will live in very poor and often very deprived communities. They cannot simply walk away from it or close their doors or hide behind tree-lined avenues. They are living in that community, and very often, all of their roots are in that community and they do not want to be moved out. All that we want is a certain amount of anonymity so that witnesses know that they will not pick up the local paper the next day and find their names published on the front page. I do not think that that is too much to ask on behalf of people who are willing almost to put their lives at risk for the public good and come forward with evidence in serious trials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is genuinely a very difficult issue, but it has traditionally been a feature of the criminal courts in Scotland that trial is held in open court. The principles are that the interests of justices should be upheld and that there should be fairness to the accused. It follows from that that justice has to be seen to be done and, under our system, an accused should know who is giving evidence in his trial. I think that it would be difficult to make provision only in respect of a limited category of cases. It is a problem, which is why the Strathclyde police are taking it particularly seriously and, as I mentioned earlier, have introduced a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the defence has to know who the witnesses are and there is nothing in my new clause that would suggest that the defence should not know who the witnesses are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly commend Strathclyde police for their recent strides forward in witness protection. I know that they are trying desperately hard, but they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
working with one arm tied behind their backs. It is not the police who issue the list of witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent case, again in my constituency, the witnesses' names were given to the local paper by the defence solicitor. Of course, the witnesses accused the police of giving their names and threatened to withdraw their information. Only after they were assured that the information had not come from the police, but had come out in a press statement from the defence solicitor, did they agree to continue with their evidence. The police have tried desperately in witness protection and are making great strides forward, particularly in Strathclyde. I cannot comment on other areas because I do not have that information. It is our duty to give them every assistance to be able to do that job and to bring such cases to trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that this is another situation in which he is doing too little, too late, and that the £210,000 being made available to assist in witness protection schemes—which I think he said was over three years—goes nowhere near far enough to meet the real needs that have been identified this morning or to solve the problem of what is actually happening in many of our cities and small towns? It is a real problem because the whole credibility of the criminal justice system is being undermined by attacks on witnesses, and the Government are either unwilling or unable to do anything about it. The Government have been talking tough throughout the passage of this legislation and for a considerable time beforehand but when it comes to doing something about the problem, they run away and hide behind obscure language about the difficulties of the legal system. I am quite sure that the Government could find the solution to these difficulties if they wanted to. The problem is that they have no will to provide adequate measures to protect witnesses. That is very much to be regretted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing much to add, other than to say that we announced yesterday that an extra £20 million had been allocated to law and order issues in Scotland. Of course, our priorities must be closely examined. The present figure is £216,000 over the next three years. In light of the pilot scheme, we shall keep in close contact with chief police officers to find out their views on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot accept what the Minister has said this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) is absolutely right. The Government talk tough on these issues but when it comes to doing anything, they step back. I am not convinced that the witnesses in these trials are the first on the Government's list of priorities. They are very often the forgotten heroes of trials, who, the day after the trial—if the case has gone that far—are left to find their own way home and to live in their communities the best they can. I think that the Government are hanging witnesses out to dry and I cannot withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only say to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, wait until the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 18 would amend section 51 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, relating to the remand and committal of children and young persons, its effects would be twofold. First, it would return to sheriffs the discretion to commit children subject to children's hearing supervision to a local
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
authority instead of having to commit them to prisons pending trial or disposal. The 1995 Act removed 16 and 17-year-olds from that category. The discretion that existed until April 1996 should be returned to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the new clause would ensure that the cost of committals to local authorities pending trial and disposal should be met by the local authority in which the child lives and not by the local authority in which the sheriff court happens to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is designed to remedy the two anomalies introduced by section 51 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. The first anomaly concerns local government reorganisation in April of this year. There is a glaring absurdity in section 51 which allows a court to commit to a local authority an offender younger than 16 years instead of committing him to prison. The measure refers to committals for trial or sentence and the court can require committal to secure accommodation, with the local authority picking up the Bill. Which local authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 51 requires a court to commit to the local authority in which the accidental location of the court happens to be. That authority must pick up the Bill, rather than the local authority in whose care the child might be—where the child normally lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a number of examples of that crazy situation: a 15-year-old child living in the North Ayrshire council area—the example will interest the hon. Member for Ayr—commits an offence in the North Ayrshire council area and is prosecuted in the local sheriff court, which happens to be in Kilmarnock. If the sheriff at Kilmarnock decides to commit the child to secure accommodation pending trial, which local authority will pick up the bill? Will it be East Ayrshire council because Kilmarnock sheriff court happens to be in that area? In other words, North Ayrshire can never pick up the bill. So, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ayr, East Ayrshire will pick up the bill for North Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take a similar scenario, a 15-year-old lives in Motherwell and offends in Motherwell—in North Lanarkshire—but is prosecuted in a local sheriff court in Hamilton, which is in South Lanarkshire. So, South Lanarkshire picks up the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are similar examples throughout the country: Glasgow City council pays for South Lanarkshire's children in the Rutherglen and Cambuslang area and in the Strathkelvin area of East Dumbartonshire because those areas fall within the jurisdiction of Glasgow sheriff court. That affects my area too. East Dumbartonshire does rather well out of the system because Glasgow City council picks up the bill in one half of the region and West Dumbartonshire does so in the other, which is covered by the sheriff court in Dumbarton. Such situations cannot be allowed to continue. Will the Minister consider the issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
The second anomaly concerns discretion. We want to address the issue and to return discretion to the courts in terms of how they deal with pre-trial children aged 16 or 17, who are the subject of a children's hearing supervision. There is an anomaly in that a child is defined by section 30 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and by section 93 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 as, first, a person under 16 years of age and, secondly, as a 16 or 17-year-old under a children's hearing supervision. Many of those 16 or 17-year-olds are under supervision on non-offence grounds—for example, on grounds of care. Indeed, they may have been the victims of neglect, cruelty or sexual offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 24 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 gave the courts equal powers in dealing with children up to the age of 17 years. They could decide to commit them to a local authority instead of to prison pending trial. Schedule 6, paragraph 14 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995 removed 16 and 17-yearolds from that judicial discretion. The Act was never enforced and was repealed by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 which implemented its terms via section 51 from April 1996. The new clause would remedy that anomaly. Sheriffs have expressed frustration from the Bench. Areas such as Glasgow want to avoid sending to prison, pending trial, voluble young people aged under 18 on current children's hearing supervision. But they have been forced to do so because section 51 removes choice from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some sheriffs have reluctantly found a way round that. It is rather ingenious, but only a partial solution to the dilemma. They release people on bail with condition of residence, for example in secure accommodation, but that is unsatisfactory. Bail may not always be appropriate; in addition, a young person could be so held for many months before being brought to trial. As the Minister knows, they are not safeguarded by the 110-day rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is consistent with the 1995 Act, which refers to children, including 16 to 17-year-olds in children's hearing supervision, in its provisions relating to the criminal justice system. If the Government are unhappy at the restoration of that judicial discretion, they will doubtless introduce provision for the prosecutor to have yet another appeal on the grounds of leniency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new clause cannot be accepted as drafted, but I shall consider tabling an appropriate amendment on Report. I can go into the matter in greater detail if the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a point with the Minister. I am surprised that he does not want to have a proper debate on the new clause because at its root is the ability of local authorities to provide secure accommodation for 16 and 17-year-olds, and for under 16s, who are referred to them by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious problem across Scotland. My authority—Dundee city council—is already £250,000 in excess of the budget for placing young offenders in secure accommodation: the difficulty is the cost. There is not enough secure accommodation in Scotland. By and large, it is controlled by central Government. Rossie school and St. Mary's Kenmure are, in theory, independent schools, but are funded directly by the Government. The Government have complete control and can charge what they like to local authorities who send youngsters to secure accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I have been told that sending a youngster to Rossie for a year costs a local authority £87,000. Most authorities are desperate to provide close support units under their own steam so that they control the secure accommodation. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) wrote to the Minister to ask him about the matter. On 30 September the Minister replied that he would have early discussions with Dundee city council about providing such accommodation. By the beginning of December he had not contacted the council and my hon. my Friend had to write again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has the Minister to say about opening negotiations on making available secure accommodation under local authority control? That would allow them to control the cost and to provide the places necessary under the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the debate should be allowed to become as wide as the hon. Gentleman wants. We are talking about the local authority to which the child belongs paying the bill regardless of where the child is placed. The question of whether authorities should build such facilities should be taken up outwith the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAl0lion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will now write to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West or to me, explaining the Government's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government accept that this is another example of Glasgow being expected to carry a burden for neighbouring authorities? Will the Minister undertake speedily to examine the matter with a view to making an appropriate adjustment in Glasgow's grant from central Government to cover those costs, or are they already covered by the grant? If so, how much is Glasgow receiving as a subsidy for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds me of the not inconsiderable costs to local authorities. He will be aware that keeping a child in secure accommodation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
for a year amounts to more than £74,000. That breaks down to £1,436 per week—a significant sum for cash-strapped local authorities. It is also an unplanned element in the budget: it depends entirely on how a court deals with a particular case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept the figures just cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton? As my hon. Friend explained, that element of a local authority's budget cannot be foreseen so it might result in expenditure that runs beyond limits. In those circumstances, the authority could well be attacked by the Government for overspending, even though that overspending was no fault of its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that there is a crisis in caring for young repeat offenders? Does he recognise that in my area as in others, there are youngsters who the legal system seems unable to deal with adequately? Such youngsters offend repeatedly, knowing full well that they are too young to be charged and locked up. They behave badly with impunity. Will the Minister address that problem with the urgency it deserves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, it is desirable to have the necessary amount of secure accommodation in Scotland. That is not in dispute. A review was undertaken earlier and a statement was issued, as a result of which extra secure accommodation was provided in Scotland. As I mentioned earlier, I have some sympathy with the new clause. It is designed to give the court a specified range of discretion to determine which local authority should have responsibility for placing the child—already subject to supervision requirement—who has been charged and convicted of offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the new clause is worthy. As drafted, however, it would allow the court discretion to decide whether the 16 or 17-year-old should be detained at all in any setting. That contradicts the purpose of section 51 of the 1995 Act, which deals with young people who are not released on bail. It would not require the court to consider—for 16 and 17-year-olds—any of the relevant options in the provisions. I doubt whether that was the intention of the hon. Member for Dumbarton in drafting the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause prescribes a number of options for the court to follow, whereas a discretion for the court to decide the most appropriate authority in each case would be less inflexible. That said, I appreciate the merits of requiring the court to decide on the most appropriate local authority to be responsible for placing the young person, having considered the range of authorities that could do so. That would be a useful extension of the 1995 Act, which would allow the court discretion to make more sensitive decisions. I

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clauses and amendments have been tabled to toughen the provisions on probation and community service orders. I look forward to receiving support from Conservative Members as well as from my hon. Friends on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the new clauses first. Their effect would be to ensure that community service orders are better targeted as alternatives to prison as Parliament intended. The Minister will know that community service orders were introduced in Scotland on a pilot basis in 1977—originally as an additional requirement on a probation order, and as an order in its own right by virtue of the Community Service By Offenders (Scotland) Act 1978, which was superseded by section 61 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990. The new clauses also seek to ensure that an offender knows what the alternative prison sentence would have been when he consents to a community service order and what the likely sentence will be if he fails to comply. That strengthens the credibility and effectiveness of the community service orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Gill McIver at Stirling university researched the impact of the 1990 Act. She found that the use of community service orders as an alternative to custody increased from more than 40 per cent. of all orders to around 55 per cent. of all orders. That means that at least 40 per cent. of all community service orders were still not being used instead of custody. Dr. McIver's findings have never been disputed within or outwith Government. She was able to use comparable material before and after the 1990 Act, such as the number of previous convictions and previous custodials and whether the case was heard on indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few months, we have heard quite a lot from the Secretary of State right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), and others about honesty in sentencing. We have heard it used about prison and detention. I should like honesty in sentencing to extend to community service. In a real sense, our proposals would strengthen that. The offender would know what the alternative prison sentence would be when he consented to community service. For the first time, he or she will know what to expect if they fail to comply with the order and are returned to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament says that community service must be used only instead of custody in the 1990 Act. However, the majority of sentences imposed for failure to comply with community service orders result in non-custodial sentences. That cannot be right, and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
look to the Minister to agree with me on that point. If it is not right, it cannot strengthen the credibility of community service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office publishes an annual community service orders bulletin which shows the proportion of sentences given for breach due to non-compliance. The 1993 figures—the latest available—typically show that 17 per cent. of people received fines, 34 per cent. received other non-custodial sentences and only 49 per cent. received custodial sentences. That is a weakness to be tackled, and our proposal would tackle it head on. It would require the court to declare its alternative prison term before the order is made. It would require it to have regard to that term in determining its sentence on breach for any non-compliance by the offender. In normal circumstances, we would expect those two terms to be the same. However, the courts must be given some discretion to consider the circumstances of the order, the offenders' attitude towards it and their performance on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be a real strengthening of the system, not a cosmetic one, or one that is like that proposed by the Secretary of State, who wants uniforms to be worn publicly by community service workers, with signs and vans publicly displayed at their work sites. That will give more publicity to the Government, but will do nothing to toughen the regime and ensure that community service orders mean what they say
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 331 would toughen up probation matters. It could be introduced at no cost, which should please the Government. It would increase the powers of the court in dealing with a further offence committed during a period of probation supervision. Courts are currently restricted on how they can deal with a breach of probation caused by a new offence. They have two choices: they can either take no action or end the probation order and re-sentence for the original offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, the courts have far wider powers for dealing with all other failures to comply with a probation order, with the sole exception of a further offence. There are four choices: they can impose a fine of up to £1,000 and let the probation continue; impose a community service order and let the probation continue; vary any of the requirements of the probation order; revoke the order and re-sentence for the original offence. The amendment would widen the courts' discretion and, at the same time, strengthen the sanctions for breach of a probation order for further offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commission of a further offence is a serious matter when committed during a period of probation. Since, at present, the court has only two choices—either to take no action or to end the probation and make another disposal—the result is many no-actions. That undermines the seriousness of probation. The court should not have fewer sanctions available to it when dealing with a further offence than it has when dealing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
with a further offence than it has when dealing with any other non-compliance. With that in mind, we wish to strengthen probation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 332 would give greater discretion to the courts when deciding on custody for breach of supervised attendance orders by 16 to 17-year-olds. The intent was to keep 16 to 17-year-olds out of prison for non-payment of fines because those who were unemployed would not be eligible for state benefits. But current legislation has the opposite effect—more 16 and 17-year-olds go into custody for longer periods for fine default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Minister an example. A sheriff court, in imposing a £50 fine on a 16-year-old, might conclude that it cannot be paid within 28 days and therefore must, according to the 1995 Act, impose a supervised attendance order at first instance instead of the fine, which the offender is given no chance to pay. An offender who breaches the supervised attendance order would face up to three months imprisonment. A 26year-old who fails to pay a £50 fine imposed by the same court for the same offence could be given a maximum prison sentence of seven days if the court decided not to exercise its discretion to impose a supervised attendance order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Uniquely, 16 and 17 year-olds can be given a supervised attendance order in the first instance. A failure to comply should not restrict a court only to detention or a variation of hours. Like any other social work disposal of first instance—for example, a community service order or probation—a court should have full discretion to revoke an order if it has been breached and to deal with the offender in any way that it could have done if it had not made the supervised attendance order. That is especially necessary because a court does not have a social inquiry report prior to an order being imposed and therefore does not know all the relevant circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would bring the provisions for the supervised attendance order into line with the alternatives to custody, such as probation and community service where an offender is given the opportunity to withhold consent. It makes sense to give an offender that opportunity so that a court can identify those people who have no intention of complying with such orders, preferring instead to risk imprisonment. As the situation stands, considerable and unnecessary work and costs to the public purse are likely to be incurred when an offender has no intention of complying with a supervised attendance order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for provision is more important for supervised attendance orders than for probation and community service orders because those two disposals require a social work report on suitability before they
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
can be imposed. There is no such requirement when making a supervised attendance order. An offender may plan to move to a jurisdiction where supervised attendance orders are not available—for example, England and Wales—so why insist on them when they cannot be completed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 332 has some flaws, but in so far as it relates to the operation of supervised attendance orders as a first instance disposal for 16 and 17-year-old defaulters, it has some merit. I am prepared to consider that and, if appropriate, to table a Government amendment on Report focusing on its objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, I cannot say the same in relation to new clauses 19 and 20. They would require the court to state what the custodial sentence would have been had the order not been made and then to have regard to that period when sentencing for breach. Community service is an order made only where the court intended to impose a custodial sentence. When the court finds that the offender has failed to comply, it may deal with the offender for the original offence in all the ways which would have originally been available to the court at the time. In essence, the court has the same discretion as it would have were new clause 19 and new clause 20 accepted. On those grounds, I ask the hon. Members in whose names the new clause stand to withdraw them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 331 would, on the face of it, appear to broaden the powers of the court when dealing with an offender who has committed a further offence while subject to a probation order. the amendment would enable the court to impose a fine, vary any of the requirements of the probation order or to make a community service order. In dealing with the offender for the commission of an offence while subject to a probation order, we do not think that it would be appropriate for the court to vary any of the requirements of an order with which the offender has failed to comply, with the most important single factor being good behaviour. Nor do we think it appropriate for the court to impose a community service order, as community service orders may be made only where the court otherwise intended to impose a custodial sentence. The objective of probation is to enable offenders to change their pattern of behaviour, and the commission of a further offence while subject to the order strikes at the very principle of probation. I therefore have to resist amendment No. 331, although I have accepted the principle behind amendment No. 332 and will return to that subject on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly hope that this new clause will succeed because, from past experience of events in court, it is clear that it would introduce a necessary development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following a recent court case, Zero Tolerance has drawn attention to the need for judges to be better informed about women who are abused. Woman can suffer years of sexual, physical and verbal abuse before they finally snap. Indeed, domestic violence cases form a large proportion of all crimes committed in Scotland, so it is hardly surprising that, in some cases, a woman ends up in court for assaulting, or even murdering, the man who has been abusing her for months and even years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Men who abuse their partners in such a way do it because they can. They are quite capable of controlling their behaviour and do not go into the work place and assault their work mates because their work mates and employers would not stand for it. But if they were so foolish as to assault a fellow worker, and if that fellow worker employee delivered a blow in return, the force of which could result in the death of the person who started the fight, courts tend to be sympathetic. The law of Scotland accepts a plea of provocation as relevant to reducing the charge or sentence, and the law deals with cases of sudden rage and loss of control of temper on one occasion in a brawl such as I have described. But it does not deal adequately with the case of a woman who has been under fear and dread for years owing to physical blows or having boiling water or boiling oil held over her and who, one day, finally loses control. It is no good saying that she should maintain control because the law does not take the same attitude towards the bloke who suddenly loses his temper and snaps and fights back, resulting in an unfortunate death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither is it any good to say that women should leave their partners because, in the vast majority of cases, they are in fear and dread that their partner will come after them and find them; there are not nearly enough refuges in which women can seek safety. The law does not take adequate account of the different circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now consider the parts of the clause that refer to children in court. Judges are mostly elderly and, in almost all cases, male. Their experience of socialising with young children is minimal or non-existent. They could learn from primary teachers and those involved
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
in nursery education how to speak to young children so that the children understand. Communication skills among the judiciary should be developed. A child may simply not understand a judge, speaking with the accent and vocabulary of the ascendancy. Indeed, the judge may not understand the child. Of course, the same applies to adults in court, but it would take an exceptionally self-confident child to say that he or she did not understand what the judge was asking or attempting to convey. Indeed, there are times in this Committee, with the multiplicity the accents across the British Isles, when we do not understand each other, but at least we, as adults, can convey that. A child in court is liable to be left to be as silent as he and she can get away with. Therefore, there could be a serious lack of communication, which could be harmful to the outcome of the case. This Parliament has talked at length about the necessity to protect child witnesses and vulnerable adult witnesses and there have been developments in that particular sphere. I know that the Minister intends to continue that process and to make such protections more widely available in our courts. Quite apart from issues such as the availability of screens and the questioning of children in safer circumstances, there is the whole question of communicating with the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we cannot currently ensure that judges are more representative of the society that we serve, given that there is only one female judge in a permanent appointment, no black or ethnic-minority judges and very few who were born to working-class parents and went to the local comprehensive for their basic education, we should at least ensure that the judges' limitations do not have unfortunate results on others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to what the hon. Lady has had to say on the important topic of training for members of the judiciary. We are accustomed to reading about the perceived inadequacies of the judiciary every time they hand down a sentence which, as reported, strikes particular commentators as being at odds with their expectations. That is an occupational hazard for those holding high judicial office and it is right that they should continue to exercise the independence of judgment which is of central importance to their role. They, however, like the rest of us, are only human and the law has long provided various routes of appeal, to which others have been added recently. However, we should not overlook the fact that candidates for judicial office are selected from the ranks of those with a sound knowledge of substantive law and a wide experience of the work of the courts. For that group, what is at issue is not so much training, which can perhaps be defined fairly narrowly, but opportunities for further professional development and time to keep abreast of developments in areas of the law that concern them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging to note that the new Lord President of the Court of Session, Lord Rodger, made specific
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
reference to the importance of training in his formal address on the occasion of his installation in October. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to play their part"—judges "must keep up with new areas and the new thinking here, in Europe and in the Commonwealth. The Faculty of Advocates, the Law Society and the Sheriff's Association have done much to provide the necessary training for practitioners and Sheriffs. I hope that in the near future, the equivalent facilities for Supreme Court Judges may also be improved".</p></blockquote>
One avenue that the Lord President is, I know keen to explore is the possibility of Senators of the College of Justice participating in joint training with colleagues from the Shrieval Bench. The Government will shortly be announcing their response to the recommendations of the right hon. Lord Cameron of Lochbroom's group from enhancements to current arrangements for the training of both permanent and temporary sheriffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past year there has been significant effort invested in training for all permanent and temporary sheriffs in relation to both in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995 and the new Children (Scotland) Act 1995, which will be brought fully into operation next April. The need for this training was identified in discussion with the sheriffs' associations and I believe that that provides a more collaborative model for the future than any list of prescribed topics enshrined in statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear to the hon. Member for Maryhill that I sympathise with the new clause to the extent that I agree that there should be arrangements that help to ensure that judges keep abreast of developments in the law and its legal practice. I hope that it will be possible to secure their collaboration in the training arrangements that are being developed for sheriffs. I know that the Lord President is sympathetic with that aim. I hope that, with those assurances, the hon. Lady will not press the new clause to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it was possible to appeal against a judgment, but, given the costs involved in an appeal, that is hardly an appropriate answer. It would be better if sound judgments were made in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made reference to various training schemes that are under way, but he did not say whether any of those schemes involved training people in how to deal with domestic violence, children or vulnerable witnesses. Unless those three categories are included—and unless serious steps are taken—I have no option but to press the new clause to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard similar reassurances for the nine years that I have been a Member of Parliament, but practically nothing ever changes. The Minister's answer was unsatisfactory; if he does not give a more positive response I shall press the new clause to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are nearing the end of our consideration of the Bill. I should like to thank the members of the Committee and the staff of the House, without whose scrutiny of the Bill our task would be less effective and more difficult. I pay tribute to the good humour, diligence, thoroughness and conviction that all members of the Committee have displayed over the past few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standing Committees often do their work away from the media spotlight, but that work is often some of the most important that Parliament does. I have greatly valued the scrutiny and debate that has taken place in the Standing Committee and I appreciate the demands that it has placed on hon. Members' time and energy. That prompts me to refer to something that I said at our first sitting, Mr. Martin, during the debate on the sittings motion. I said that I hoped that we would be suitably thorough, without causing any unnecessary inconvenience to hon. Members. However, 	<i>Hansard</i> recalls me as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that we can be suitably thorough without causing any unnecessary inconvenience to Ministers."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12 November 1996; c.4.]</p></blockquote>
Committee Members will appreciate that I wish to confirm that Standing Committees are not for the convenience of Ministers. I take this opportunity to correct a very minor slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to thank all those who have helped us during the Committee. That long list includes many in the House and in the Scottish Office, the representatives and voluntary organisations who have given us the benefit of their comments and expertise during our deliberations. I know that all members of the Committee are grateful to those concerned for their hard work and the care that they have put in. There have been differences on matters of policy; that is healthy and not unusual. Our discussion in Committee has been marked, as I mentioned, by good humour as well as by strong conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Constructive and helpful suggestions have been made, quite a number of which have been accepted in principle or an undertaking has been given to consider
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
them. As a result, the Bill has been improved. The hon. Member for Dumbarton has noticed that the Scottish draftsmen's grammar is not always perfect and we shall act upon that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all members of the Committee will thank the Officers of the House, your colleagues and you, in particular, Mr. Martin, for keeping us in hand, while allowing us a little reign. You also wished us to be brief and to the point and I hope that I succeed in meeting your expectations on this occasion, at least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I would like to add to the Minister's points. First, I thank you very sincerely, Mr. Martin—and Mrs. Winterton—for your unfailing courtesy during the proceedings. I also thank the Minister for his ever-present courtesy, which never departs him. The Committee has been characterised by the silence of the hon. Member for Ayr, but we like him that way because it has added to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my colleagues and those people who have assisted us. We do not have the support of the civil service, but organisations such as social work departments and COSLA, and voluntary organisations such as Enable, Victim Support and the Law Society have provided us with amendments and given us assistance. We would like to thank those organisations, we thank the Officers of the House and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thoroughly enjoyed the Committee. Very serious and important matters have been debated, but with the long hours, we must keep a sense of humour as well as putting across a serious case. I am grateful to the officers who have looked after the Committee—the Badge Messengers and the police officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must thank my colleague, Ann Winterton, who is an excellent Chairman. On one occasion we had to call on the assistance of Sir James Hill. We do not have league tables for chairmen, but Sir James has looked after more Committees than any other chairman on the Chairmen's Panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the Clerk, Frank Cranmer. He is not present today because he is away looking for yet another venue for the Scottish Grand Committee—I hope that it is not too far north of Glasgow. I also thank Mr Devine who has assisted us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Maryhill's reference to training for judges. Some of us have had training to be judges. When I was a justice of the peace I received some training and the first case that I had to deal with involved two brothers who had committed an assault. I had it in mind to fine them £10 but following the colourful case made by the lawyer, I decided to reduce the fine to £5 each. It turned out that the two brothers were in a public house in the north of Glasgow where a well-known character had got on to a table because he was not too happy about the attempts of the accordionist to enlighten the evening. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
chucker-out dragged him off the table and and the two brothers said, "Please leave this gentleman alone because he is adding to the merriment of the evening." I have never been in a pub in Glasgow when someone was said to be adding to the merriment of the evening. the chucker-out dropped the well-known character and proceed to fight with the two brothers. I do not know whether the lawyer knew that he managed to reduce his clients' fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
I also have a constituency to look after and we all worry about the terrible events that happen, but we should never be too eager to punish or imprison people because it is terrible to take away anyone's liberty and dignity. I thank everyone for an interesting Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
