<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CONFISCATION OF ALCOHOL FROM PERSONS UNDER 18</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 55, leave out lines 31 to 36 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person of or over the age of 18 has alcoholic liquor in his possession in a public place and that a person—
<ol>
<li>has supplied such liquor to a person under the age of 18 for consumption in a public place; or</li>
<li>intends that the liquor should be consumed in a public place by a person under the age of 18,'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
This technical amendment clarifies the policy intention that alcoholic liquor may be confiscated from a person aged 18 or over in a public place only if it has been supplied or is intended for supply by the adult to an under-age person for consumption in a public place. The amendment is intended to address the issues highlighted in evidence from southern Ireland relating to the enforcement of collecting drink from a young person who tries to pass it to somebody over the age of 18 as soon as a police officer hoves into sight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The topic was discussed on Second Reading and I asked this question then, but as I did not get a satisfactory answer, perhaps the Minister can respond to it today.<br><br>
When a crowd of young people are gathered in a street, they are not all likely to be under or all likely to be over the age of 18—some will be under 18 and some will be over 18. I cannot imagine how a police constable will be able to distinguish one from the other and say "You, you and you can hold on to this alcohol, but these others may not". He has a genuine difficulty in trying to enforce the law, because young people do not congregate in tidy groups of over-18s or under-18s. How will that problem be resolved? It is important that young people under the legal age should not consume alcohol in the street or other public places, but enforcing this requirement may cause some difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for allowing me to explain the purpose of the amendment more fully. Its purpose is to put it beyond doubt that police powers to confiscate alcohol from an adult in a public place extend only to circumstances where they have reasonable grounds for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
suspecting that the adult has supplied—or intends to supply—the alcohol to under-age persons for consumption in public.<br><br>
The provision in the clause seeks to close a significant loophole that came to light during the operation of the provisions in the 1988 Irish legislation. When police approached a mixed age group of public drinkers—including drinkers who were both under and over 18 years of age—the alcohol was always to be found only in the hands of the 18-year olds and over, and could not therefore be confiscated. But the test in the clause is "reasonable grounds"—a phrase that is also mentioned in the amendment. Clearly there may be problems of enforcement, but if the police officer has reasonable grounds he can proceed and a report is sent to the procurator fiscal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent explanation and I am delighted that such a realistic approach has been adopted. My right hon. Friend's explanation answers the comments made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), but another aspect that could be considered in another Committee considering a different Bill is the provision of, and requirement for, identity cards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This issue goes back a long way in Scottish politics. In 1987, shortly after I was first elected, I started to raise the issue of under-18s drinking alcohol in public places and causing a nuisance to people and the environment. I have met with a great lack of success in trying to persuade the Minister to do something about that. One argument that the Minister and his officials have used over the years is that it would be discriminatory to take action against people on the grounds of age—that is, because they are under 18.<br><br>
Under the Government's amendment, if an adult—someone over 18—purchases drink, consumes it in a public place and shares it with other adults, nothing can be done. But if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that that drink is being shared with someone under 18, it can be confiscated. Will the Minister explain why that is not discriminatory? When I suggested a ban on under-18s drinking in public places, he said that that would be discriminatory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the last point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion): he and I know the problems that exist in Tayside, particularly in Dundee. He knows that in some areas drinking in public places has been banned and local byelaws have been introduced to cover that. That has created problems in other areas and the hon. Gentleman and I have had common cause for concern. The amendment is worthwhile because it addresses one of the problems that has arisen during discussion of other Bills, amendments to Bills and private Members' Bills.<br><br>
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister because if a mixed group of people, whose ages were uncertain, wanted to defy the system, they would ensure that the older ones were holding the liquor in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
the event of a blue uniform appearing. They will no longer be able to evade the policeman because if he has just cause, he will be able to take action.<br><br>
I welcome the provision because it will begin to address the problem of the indiscriminate use of public places by over-18s and by under-age drinkers who are encouraged by those over 18. The amendment goes a long way towards dealing with the problem and I congratulate my right hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the hon. Member for Dundee, East, I must say that a lot of drink has flowed under the bridge. I am delighted that Ministers have brought about a change and my earlier comments stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does a public place include the common staircase of a tenement building or multi-storey block of flats? In my constituency, the local authority has been clearing from the streets people who have been standing around with bottles in their hands. Some of my constituents have complained that those activities have been transferred to their staircases. I wonder whether the provision will cover that. If not, perhaps we should consider that aspect at a later stage of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on a couple of points. When a constable takes a drink from a group that includes young people, he may dispose of it in such a manner as he considers appropriate. Will the Minister clarify whether, in some circumstances, drink will be returned to people involved in such arrests or confiscations if it turns out that all those involved are over 18? If not, is it intended that any drink taken from a group will be lost to that group forever? Members of the Scottish Police Federation may never have occasion to buy a carryout again. I presume that that is not the intention of the proposals. However, it may be difficult to return the drink if the canister is opened and the constable has to avoid spilling it for a considerable distance.<br><br>
Finally, is the provision in clause 53(3)—that the offence will be punishable by a fine "not exceeding level 2"—intended to apply to those under 18? In my constituency, some drinkers are extremely young—occasionally as young as eight, nine or 10 years old. Would those fines apply to them? If so, that would be unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave me some concern when he mentioned a fine because no fine is referred to in the amendments. I think the hon. Gentleman's contribution would be more relevant to the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised by members of the Committee. I welcome their general welcome for the amendment. I was asked one question that goes wide of the amendment by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) about identity cards. We have said that we will publish a draft Bill on ID cards and the Home Office is in the lead on that matter. My hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) welcomed the provision and mentioned that byelaws were in operation. I vividly recall receiving a petition in Monklands, which was signed by thousands of people. The byelaws were effective because public drinking was associated with lawlessness. The hon. Member for Dundee, East raised the question of whether the provision would be discriminatory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raised the question, I was asking him why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall using the word discriminatory this morning. There must be sufficient evidence to satisfy a court and the test is one of reasonableness. The hon. Member for Maryhill asked whether wallie closes or stairwells would constitute a public place. Subsection (6)(a) states that the term public place includes
<br><blockquote><p>"any place to which the public have access for the time being (whether on payment of a fee or otherwise)".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady's question is answered by that definition. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) asked about returning drink. I shall give him a somewhat lighthearted example. In the relatively short time that I practised as an interim procurator fiscal I have had to prosecute a man for salmon poaching. The most beautiful salmon was produced in court—it smelt like anything. I found it a source of great regret that the salmon was being wasted merely to obtain a convicion—the offender was only fined a few pounds. The amendment would provide the police with the discretion to return the drink, where appropriate. The hon. Member for Govan is right: many young people could be caught under the provisions.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 322, in page 55, line 41, after 'shall', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'where there is no byelaw in force prohibiting the public consumption of alcohol,'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 323, in page 55, line 44, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'; and where there is a byelaw in force prohibiting the public consumption of alcohol it shall be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale for a person not so to comply with a requirement made under subsection (1) or (2) above.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that this will interest the hon. Members for Ayr and for North Tayside because we want to examine further the issue of alcohol and drinking. The amendments are intended to probe the Minister on the issue.<br><br>
Amendment No. 322 would ensure that, where a constable has confiscated alcohol from a person under 18 in circumstances where no byelaw is in force prohibiting the public consumption of alcohol, the fine on summary conviction would be at a level not exceeding level 2 on the standard scale. The standard scale is set out in section 225 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and level two is £500. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
amendment is designed to introduce proportionality into the offence provisions of clause 53 in the light of amendment No. 323.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Amendment No. 323 would ensure, that where a byelaw is in force prohibiting the public consumption of alcohol, the fine shall not exceed level 4 on the standard scale, which goes up to £2,500. That would reflect the more serious nature of contravening the provisions relating to the public consumption of alcohol, requiring officers to confiscate that alcohol. As hon. Members made plain earlier, debate on this subject has continued for many years. I believe that we are all pretty disgusted by the wanton drinking of alcohol in public places, which disfigures the environment.<br><br>
A few weeks ago, I attended a meeting of community activists in one of the small villages in my constituency. Its slogan for the village was, "Keep it beautiful" but the first thing those activists said to me was, "We cannot keep it beautiful, Mr. McFall; the village is disfigured because when we walk along the street we see people congregating at the shops drinking alcohol. People think that we are going back to the 1920s and 1930s; they have the impression that there is an element of lawlessness about what is going on and it diminishes the environment". As a direct consequence of that meeting, I decided that we would make some progress in clause 53, but we could make further progress.<br><br>
The message should go out loud and clear. The information that I have obtained from the House of Commons Library suggests that there are 16 alcohol-free zones in Scotland. Not every local authority has introduced a byelaw, but those that have introduced them have found them to be successful. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East and the hon. Member for North Tayside have mentioned the success of the Dundee experiment.<br><br>
In an article in <i>The Herald</i> of 22 November on the issue of byelaws banning drinking in public places being extended to East Dunbartonshire, the Minister said that measures similar to those introduced by East Dunbartonshire council had been effective in cutting drink-related nuisance in several Scottish towns. He said that the byelaws would come into effect on 20 December and supersede existing byelaws which cover the town centre of Milngavie and the town centre and Woodhead park areas of Kirkintilloch.<br><br>
The amendments would ensure that we are not hidebound. Irrespective of where drinking takes place, the police should have the power and the duty to ensure the confiscation of alcohol. I welcome the measures that have been introduced, but the Committee should send out a robust message. Closed-circuit television has helped to reduce the scourge in some town centres, and, although we cannot mention them in this Committee, successes in some towns in England have been recorded in a Home Office study that considered the experience in Scotland, as well as that in England and Wales. It referred to Coventry and the east end of London.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
The amendments are designed to put a message across publicly but also to send out a message to manufacturers. I am sickened by some of the large-scale manufacturers, which have produced Hooch and other similar drinks. About six months ago, hon. Members joined me in a meeting in the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre where representatives from Whitbread and others were telling us about their success. There is only one reason why such drinks are marketed, and that is to reach under-age drinkers. Within Scotland they are marketed near schools and in many places where there is what we would describe as urban degeneration in order to reach young people. That is the only way they can do it. I congratulate the Chancellor for introducing a tax on alcopops and other drinks in the Budget, but we want to introduce our own measures in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree in part with the hon. Gentleman, but is he aware that some of the alcohol-based beverages such as Hooch are on sale in the House of Commons Bar? I am sure that they are not aimed at under-age drinking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but there is no doubt that there is a market for under-age drinking and when we questioned the large companies they did not have a reasonable defence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is firing up a very important matter. In my judgment the marketing has to be amended to make it clear that such drinks are not designed for under-age drinkers. The hon. Gentleman is doing the Committee and the House a service by suggesting that they should look at that. He probably has the support of the whole Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for those comments. We have tried on a cross-party basis to raise this problem. On the issue of the companies, in the <i>Mail on Sunday</i> on 15 September there was an article in which a drinks distributor called Matthew Clark was heavily criticised for distributing his drink to young people. He said that Babycham and cider sales had been halved by the transfer to alcopops such as Two Dogs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I always try to give some leeway to hon. Members, particularly those on the Front Bench, but we are definitely straying here. The amendment is about byelaws, concerning the consumption of alcohol; it is not about the promotion of those types of beer or soft drinks that have had a good deal of publicity in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin, but I wonder if you would bear with me while I try to explain. There are two amendments, one in which there are byelaws and one in which there are no byelaws. The distributor that I mentioned is distributing alcopops such as Two Dogs and Hooper's Hooch. Those are the drinks that we find on our streets and I should like the police to ensure that if Two Dogs and Hooper's Hooch are being consumed, they can take them off young people.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0230">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
That is directly related to the debate on the amendment because we find it happening on the streets of our constituencies.<br><br>
The amount of money being made is estimated at £200 million to £500 million a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members can refer to those matters or even to a distributor who is getting away lightly because there is no byelaw, but when the hon. Gentleman gives us detailed information on those matters, I must bring him back to the amendment. There may be an opportunity to discuss those issues during a debate on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall go no further on that subject except to say that it is big business. The message going out to the young people on the streets of our constituencies in Scotland is that they should drink it; then they blight the environment in which our constituents live.<br><br>
We have tabled the amendment for many reasons, not least because of the issue of alcohol and crime. I mentioned earlier the Home Office standing conference on crime prevention, which looked at the problems of under-age drinking in England and Wales, and also in Scotland. The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys carried out research throughout the United Kingdom and I shall give examples of some of the questions. It is important for us to reflect on the extent of drinking that takes place.<br><br>
In response to the question, "Have you had a proper drink, a substantial measure of alcohol, in the past week?", 71 per cent. of 13-year-old males in Scotland said that they had, as did 87 per cent. of 14-year-old males, 91 per cent. of 15-year-old males, 82 per cent. of 16-year-old males and 93 per cent. of 17-year-old males. Drinking is a huge problem. For females, it ranges from 57 per cent. of 13-year-olds to 92 per cent. at 17 years of age.<br><br>
The picture that emerges from that survey is a society in which a large majority of early adolescents have had experience of alcohol. By 17, before the minimum age for drinking alcohol in pubs, at least nine out of 10 adolescents have had some experience of alcohol.<br><br>
Where do they have that experience? The question was asked of them, "Where do adolescents usually drink?" This table relates exclusively to Scotland. Six per cent. of 13-year-old males in Scotland said it was in pubs. That says something about Scottish licensing laws. It is a matter which parliamentarians should address. The figure for pubs and discos was 10 per cent., for parties, 23 per cent, at home, 59 per cent., and "elsewhere", 32 per cent. I submit that "elsewhere" means "in public".<br><br>
The need for us to tackle the problem is pressing. Thirty-two per cent. of 13-year-old males and 21 per cent. of females are drinking "elsewhere"—in public. That continues until the age of 17, which is below the official age.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
None of these figures by itself gives a clue to the relationship between adolescent drinking of alcohol and crime, but the figures show that the drinking of alcohol among under-18s is sufficiently widespread that, if alcohol and certain types of crime are associated, one would expect it to be a significant component of juvenile crime. That arms us, in terms of assisting the police, in asserting that if we tackle people for under-age drinking in Scottish streets, it will do something about the level of juvenile crime.<br><br>
An investigation was made into the association between alcohol consumption and criminal activity. In a descriptive study of 66 people in the Glasgow region charged with murder between 1953 and 1963, 70 per cent. were considered to have been affected by alcohol at the time of the offence.<br><br>
Alcohol is implicated in a wide variety of crime, and young people become involved in, for example, vehicle offences. The number of young people who steal vehicles is quite high, as is the number who drive stolen vehicles in Scotland. Under-age drinking is a problem.<br><br>
I suggest that the police should have wider powers and that Scotland's public places should be alcohol-free. I welcome the byelaws that have been implemented by local authorities, but I want to go further. Drinking in public is a scourge in terms of the effect that it can have on specific environments. I exclude restaurants and al fresco places, but I want a message to go out loud and clear to young people who congregate on street corners for wanton drinking. I look forward to the hon. Members for Ayr and for North Tayside supporting this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman said, although many of his words were more appropriate to the clause stand part debate. The Chairman made reference to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got a cheek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I say that to acknowledge what the Chairman said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not draw the Chair into the argument. The hon. Gentleman can make his own case.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. When the hon. Member talks about banning alcohol from all public places, I cannot accept that in total because there is a leisure aspect. In family picnics on beaches and in parks, a bottle of wine does not go amiss. We have to be sensitive to that, and the use of byelaws has to be aimed at making sure that we do not irresponsibly block alcohol consumption in public places totally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is wise to remember that a large part of Scotland is moors and mountains, and a wee dram is often necessary to sustain people in that sort of environment. We have to be careful about what we describe as "public places".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes my point for me. I recognise that coming from someone who does not consume alcohol or take a wee dram on hillsides, many

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
of which lie within his beautiful constituency, the fact that he makes that point for others demonstrates its importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not one for banning the ghillies, stalkers and gliders from their wee dram—do not worry about that—but Government amendment No. 249 says—
<br><blockquote><p>"a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting."</p></blockquote>
so the discretion of the police and common sense are being brought into it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would have to acknowledge that those reasonable grounds are in respect of the confiscation of alcohol from young people by people who are over the age of 21. That is altogether different.<br><br>
Although I cannot support the amendments, the hon. Gentleman said that they were probing amendments and they have a value because they give us the opportunity to consider issues that perhaps would have floated by, even in the clause stand part debate. I note that the hon. Member for Govan had the wisdom not to sign the amendments and I recognise his reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It just happened that my name was not selected. There is no implication that I do not support everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if I complimented him and suggested that he showed an element of wisdom. I withdraw those remarks unreservedly given his comment, but I would remind the hon. Members for Govan, for Maryhill and for Dumbarton that in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 I attempted to introduce clauses that would have made the consumption of alcohol in public by under-age youngsters an offence subject to conviction in a court. It was pointed out to me by Ministers and by Opposition Members that we would turn children into criminals. I accepted their argument at that time and I was delighted when the Government came up with the alternative of confiscation of alcohol.<br><br>
I am aware that the Scottish Police Federation and Douglas Keil, the general secretary, in particular, has campaigned long and hard on this subject. I am aware that at the federation's conference this year it, too, at that time, sought moves along the line that Ministers have come up with. I suspect that the attendance of my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Scotland at that conference may have been the final straw that encouraged him to go down the line that has been urged for so long by me and my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside.<br><br>
Having said that, much as I appreciate the hon. Member for Dumbarton's intentions in bringing forward the issue of byelaws for debate, I urge my right hon. Friend to reject both the amendments or at least seek to have amendment No. 322 withdrawn.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Minister has addressed the issue of alcohol-free zones and a local authority's ability to establish byelaws. He has said that local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
authorities could always achieve that aim. They could introduce provisions for the wider public good, but not simply for under-age drinkers—the public would not understand why it was illegal to sell them or give them alcohol, or for them to buy it and consume it in public places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to persuade my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton not to press his amendments, but he has not yet given any reason why my hon. Friend should do that. Can he do that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman nodded off while I was speaking, I apologise again for not speaking in a loud enough voice to keep him awake. I said that, if we were to accept the amendments, we would create a fast track into court for under-age drinkers. We would turn them into criminals, and I do not believe that that is the objective of the hon. Member for Maryhill, who is always very sympathetic to the cause of children and juveniles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr is digging deeper and deeper into the hole. Of course I am sympathetic to children's needs and rights, as I hope every hon. Member is. But that is not a reason not to have as fast a means as possible of taking the due steps, whether at children's hearings or in court, depending on the offence, if someone—of any age—commits a crime. Delay is of no benefit to anyone, least of all the child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough. I admit to being persuaded by the arguments of the hon. Member for Maryhill in previous Committee sittings. I refer to the debates on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and the Children (Scotland) Bill, when I was seeking legislation that went bang along the lines suggested by the amendments. At that time, the hon. Member for Maryhill opposed me vigorously and made the points that I am making now about turning children into criminals. While I have accepted her arguments, she has clearly abandoned them in this respect, and I regret that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot imagine how I have managed to listen to the hon. Member for Ayr. I suspect that he has not listened to what I have said. There is no question of turning children into criminals. If they break the law, action will probably be taken. We are talking about a simple case of drinking in public under the age of 18, and I do not know what I can have said in debates on the Children (Scotland) Bill that contradicts what I am saying now. Perhaps the hon. Member for Ayr can recall more exactly what I said, or what he thinks I said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can recall very easily. The hon. Lady spoke against amendments that I tabled when we were debating the Children (Scotland) Bill which asked for this very thing to happen. At that time her argument—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 has been approved by the House. Hon. Members cannot refer to amendments that were tabled to another Bill; they must stick to the present amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was sticking rigidly to the amendment, Mr. Martin, but I apologise. I will not refer to another Bill, other than to say that an amendment such as the one we are discussing was added to another Bill. I promise that I shall not refer to it again.<br><br>
Once again, standards seem to be being changed, which I regret very much: people should stick by their principles. If there has been a genuine change of heart, I shall accept it. But I suspect that the hon. Member for Dumbarton, who put the case very well and introduced many other factors, tabled probing amendments to allow us to raise the issues, think them through and then acclaim the merits of my right hon. Friend's approach in sticking to the line that he has taken—giving the police the option to confiscate alcohol from youngsters without making it an offence. It is a step forward from the status quo that will be much welcomed by my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise, rather surprisingly, to accuse the hon. Member for Ayr of being soft on drink and drink-related offences. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend Member for Dumbarton clearly toughens the penalties for those consuming alcohol in a drink-free zone. It is important to make it absolutely clear that we support the proposals in clause 53 and believe that it should become a greater offence for the law to be broken when a local authority, in response to public demand, has declared a drink-free zone.<br><br>
We must send out a message that we intend that those drink-free zones should be rigourously enforced. Generally, they have been brought into operation only after a clear process of debate and discussion and where there has been substantial local pressure to introduce the change and a willingness to make it work. By toughening the penalties, we are sending out a signal to not only the public but the police that we want to see the provisions of legislation in relation to drink-free zones enforced. It is not a trivial matter; it is extremely important for many of my constituents and those of other hon. Members who live in those areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having looked at the byelaws established by some local authorities, I see no reference to age. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that current byelaws would treat all citizens the same, irrespective of age. On that basis the amendment would be unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The distinction here, as I understand it, is that the penalties for those both under and over 18 are at the discretion of the court. The amendment says that the maximum fine will be given rather than being graded by age. There could then be tougher penalties—a higher maximum—in areas where the local authority has laid down that there should be a drink-free zone.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a point of information, clause 53 refers to under-18s. The amendment adds a differential so that there is a penalty whether there is a byelaw or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause also allows confiscation and penalties to be applied to those over 18 who are supplying drink, or who it is reasonably believed are supplying drink, to those who are under 18. That is the other strand that we have to follow.<br><br>
I want to pick up the point about the drams on the moors, relating it to this point and to the issue of beaches and parks. Glasgow does not have the power to ban drams on the moors since, to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing that could be described as a moor in Glasgow. Nor is there anything that could reasonably be described as a beach. However, there are parks—indeed, deserts possibly. The parks have had drinking banned in them as part of the ban on drinking across the whole city. That has been done because it was felt that, although some people may just have a small bottle of wine as part of a family picnic, the overall scale of the problem is substantial in terms of the numbers of people who go into parks across the city with large amounts of alcohol in both cans and bottles. They not only drink and cause a rammy while they are there; they also break the glass containers and, thereby, cause considerable difficulty and danger to others, particularly young children. We should recognise that there may be circumstances in which some local authorities choose to make a beach a drink-free zone lest the same thing happens. If broken glass from bottles that have contained alcohol is scattered across a beach, it effectively rules it out as an area suitable for young children.<br><br>
The amendments are extremely sensible. They suggest that we are far tougher on young drinkers than the Government are. I find it surprising that the hon. Member for Ayr is soft on drink, soft on the causes of crime, soft on young drinkers and is generally becoming a complete and utter wimp as our proceedings progress.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dread to think what will be said about me. All my prejudices are tempted by the amendments. Like the hon. Member for Dumbarton, I am deeply concerned about those trends, which have had an impact for a long time. I look forward to hearing whether my right hon. Friend thinks the amendments are technically competent and what views the Government have on them. My prejudices, however, lead me to believe that the amendments have substance.<br><br>
Marketing must have an impact on behaviour—that is particularly relevant because today the Scotch Whisky Association goes to court to try to prove, by using, I believe, my Act—the Scotch Whisky Act 1988—that a white whisky is not a whisky and should not be called one. If the association takes that seriously, we should take seriously all other aspects of marketing.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
Health education has an important role to play in how we deal with young people. However, I have always believed in the stick and the carrot: both weapons should be available when one is trying to change patterns of behaviour. I welcome hon. Members who have been converted to our prejudices. I do not condemn them because they have probably been converted over a period by the eloquence of my hon. Friend for Ayr, for which we should be thankful.<br><br>
I look forward to hearing my right hon. Friend's response, but the proposal for designated areas outwith the areas that are already defined in byelaws has merits. We have learnt from the Tayside experiments that making an area a drink-free zone can transfer the problem elsewhere. If the amendments are competent and acceptable, they will partly deal with that problem.<br><br>
I recognise that young people, if charged, may be made into criminals. I repeat, however, that there is merit in what is being attempted by the amendments. That is why I am interested to hear my right hon. Friend's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister define more closely what is meant by a public place—a term which relates to both amendments? Did his earlier definition, which he gave in response to my question about a close in a tenement or the staircase of a multi-storey block of flats, include a close with a controlled entry? There are many such closes in Glasgow and elsewhere, which is why it is crucial to decide whether such closes are included.<br><br>
I also have concerns about some of the comments made about the amendments. I want to make my position very clear to the hon. Member for Ayr and to anyone else who might be confused about my view on the matter. I think that there should be severe penalties against any person aged over 18 who tries to encourage much younger persons to drink alcohol. Our society has taken drug consumption more seriously than alcohol consumption. There is no reason for that because alcohol causes more deaths, crimes of violence and serious illness than all the other drugs put together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Lady acknowledge that that is the status quo? The courts already have the right to impose such penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly think that the courts have that right, but the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton, especially amendment No. 323, are helpful. They provide a way for the Committee and Parliament to say that they will not treat the matter lightly. If young people are being encouraged to commit criminal acts to fund the buying of alcohol, or are becoming less inhibited after imbibing alcohol and committing other crimes, we must, for their sake, have some control over that. Therefore, I fully support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not intending to take part in the debate, but it has warmed up somewhat. Like my hon. Friends, I welcome any attempt by the Government or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
anyone else to try to deal with the problems afflicting many people in Scotland. Some housing schemes in areas which many Opposition Members represent have suffered seriously from gangs of youngsters who gather to drink in public places and then behave outrageously, running through people's gardens, throwing things at their windows and generally terrorising the local population. Anything that helps to prevent that must be welcome.<br><br>
I also welcome the idea of alcohol-free zones in cities, which my local Labour-controlled council in Dundee pioneered, often with a lack of co-operation from the Scottish Office, which was not keen on such initiatives. Closed-circuit television has been pioneered by Labour councils throughout Scotland and makes a significant contribution to ensuring that our city centres become safe places. The hon. Member for North Tayside knows well that Dundee, where I come from, has experienced a tremendous shift in its economic base. Manufacturing plants are locating elsewhere in the world; we must remake ourselves for the new world by trying to attract new businesses to the city centre and new life with restaurants and so on where adults will want to go. That will not happen if city centres are dominated by young people drinking in public places and causing a general nuisance.<br><br>
I must tell the hon. Member for Ayr that to be on the left does not mean being a weak, lily-livered liberal and to be a socialist does not mean being a lily-livered liberal. No one ever called Stalin liberal. In the democratic republic of North Korea, there is no problem with drinking in public places because anyone who tries to do that gets shot very quickly. I am not suggesting that that should happen here, but socialists can be as tough on drinking as anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman is sure of the position: in my opinion he is anything but a lily-livered liberal. He is an old-fashioned socialist of the sort we understand, which is not new Labour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I should be happy for that to appear in big, bold type in <i>Hansard.</i><br><br>
Much will depend on how the provision is implemented. Reference has been made to public parks and having a glass of wine. Some of us sometimes go to Celtic park. Just outside is a public place where, before Glasgow introduced the ban on drinking in public places, there would be up to 200 people standing and drinking Hooch and Two Dogs and generally causing mayhem. Such activity has now stopped and Glasgow must be congratulated on that, although it has also happened in other places. But there is some hypocrisy involved because those who drive up in big cars go into executive suites inside the ground. The curtains are drawn and they then get out the drink—whisky, gin, beer and wine—with their meal. The curtains are drawn back when the game starts and they can be seen in all their glory, with rosy cheeks and as flushed as anyone who has been to the pub.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about such things. I am one of the punters. As the hon. Gentleman has the inside story, he must participate in these things to know about them in such detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, as always, misjudges me. In fact, I am a season ticket holder, and I take my place in the north stand along with the rest of the Celtic supporters. I have no access to the executive suites, but stories circulate in the stands about the sort of people who do—the sort of people who sponsor the Conservative party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the team the hon. Gentleman supports should follow the example of Patick Thistle, which has provided an extensive indoor area where people can enjoy food and drink, and which is open to as many people as wish to go there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is interesting to hear about the ad hoc garden parties that take place in Glasgow, but they have nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Martin, but not many Celtic supporters would welcome the idea of following the example of Partick Thistle—I do not think that we would ever want Celtic to do that.<br><br>
Hon. Members have mentioned drams on the moors. Sport could become one of the most important leisure activities in the Scottish economy. There will be an attempt to encourage families to come to watch games—especially of football and rugby—and to follow the American example. If one goes to a north American football game, one sees all the cars in the car park, and people having a picnic lunch before they go to the game. I am concerned that the clause will make it illegal for a family to get out their hamper and bottle of wine in a public place such as a car park outside a sports stadium; the police would immediately become involved because they would have reasonable grounds for suspecting that those people would give a glass of wine to someone under 18. We should think about that issue because the economy might develop in that way—we are passing legislation that may have a serious impact on it.<br><br>
There is an element of hypocrisy in the way in which adult Members of Parliament approach many of the issues surrounding under-age drinking. As my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said, if we are genuinely concerned to do something about under-age drinking, we should impose the severest penalties on those adults who try to encourage under-age drinking. The worst adults are the manufacturers of new drinks, such as Hooch and Two Dogs, who try to profit from the activity. They should receive severe penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled that those new drinks have nothing to do with the amendment, which is clear. I might be able to allow a little leeway during the clause stand part debate, but I certainly cannot do so during debate on the amendments. The amendments relate to general punishments rather than to anyone supplying drink to those who are under age.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely that the subject has nothing to do with the amendments, Mr. Martin, but what I am saying is true none the less. The hon. Member for Ayr is now in a dilemma about the amendment: he does not know whether to appear to be as tough as the Opposition on people who fall foul of the amendment and to vote for it. He will have the opportunity to put his vote where his mouth is. The hon. Member for Ayr talks a very tough line against those who step outside the law, but he sometimes does not follow it up in practice. During an earlier debate about Ecstasy tablets being trafficked inside Hanger 13 in Ayr, the hon. Gentleman was the greatest defender of Hanger 13 and was against its licence being withdrawn. It will be interesting to see how he votes on the private Member's Bill that would withdraw the licence from clubs involved in drug trafficking. The hon. Gentleman is on record as saying that he will vote against the Bill.<br><br>
The success of the clause will depend on how it is implemented. The police will have a great deal of responsibility for how the amendment is put into effect in Scotland. I suspect that the police, who are already tremendously under-resourced and under great pressure when trying to deal with present levels of criminal activity, will find it difficult to get the resources to ensure that the changes to the law are properly implemented. If they have to divert resources, they may divert them to areas where there is most public pressure—the better areas of the city, where people have telephones, are better off and articulate, and can therefore apply more pressure. There is a danger that the poorest areas of the city, where people do not have those resources and cannot appeal to the police, will not receive support from them. When the Bill is on the statute book it will not make any difference to their lives, and that will be a tragedy. I hope that, no matter what we do about the clause, whichever party forms the Government after the next election will direct resources where they are most needed in Scotland, which invariably means the poorest areas.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a constructive debate. In answer to the hon. Members for Dumbarton, extensive provisions are already available in the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 to prohibit sales to under-18s. The police are targeting shops where sales to those who are under 18 are, or are believed to be, taking place. We have encouraged more byelaws. We have consistently encouraged councils to prevent such sales. We shall consider carefully any proposals, but already some 16 sets of byelaws are in place, with many more in the pipeline.<br><br>
I listened with great interest to the points in support of the amendments. The provisions in the Bill are aimed principally at under-age drinkers and are intended to provide the police with the powers to deal with the nuisance caused by such people without resorting to the courts. We expect that, in practice,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
relatively few people will be charged under these provisions, but the powers are there as a last resort if needed.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendments is greatly to increase the severity of the penalty for this offence, if it is committed in an area in which drinking in public is prohibited by byelaws. The practical effect would be that a person could be fined up to £2,500 for failing to supply his name and address to a police officer, a fine which I feel is a bit steep, or for failing to hand over any alcohol in his possession. I have, however, noted the strong feeling on both sides of the Committee in favour of more serious penalties, and I shall consider with colleagues the most appropriate level of penalty.<br><br>
I should mention that the police have, under byelaws, a general power to require a person to supply both name and address when they suspect that an offence is being or has been committed. If the offence is committed in a drink-free zone, the accused will probably be charged with a contravention of the byelaw and with this offence. The court will therefore be able to impose a cumulative penalty greater than a level 2 fine, which is £500.<br><br>
Under clause 53(3) there could be a level 2 penalty for an offence—for example, the byelaw offence—and a cumulative level penalty for the other offence. Thus the offender would face a potential penalty of £1,000. The two offences will be, first, the offence of drinking in public where there is a byelaw prohibiting drinking in public and, secondly, the offence of failing to surrender alcohol or supply the name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the clause refers specifically to under-18 drinkers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will he also say whether, under byelaws, there is any reference to age limits? If not, would byelaws affect under-18s, irrespective of the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As I explained, there could be two offences, one under the Bill and one under byelaws. The cumulative fine, if the person were convicted of both, would be £1,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given my right hon. Friend's response, does not that negate the need for the amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek a level of £2,500. In the case of an unemployed person, for example, I believe that that is too steep. The penalty must be proportionate to the circumstances of the offence. I do not think that the hon. Member for Dumbarton would dispute that. He is saying that for a person over 18 who is acting in a wholly irresponsible way which could cause a great deal of harm to young persons the existing level of £500 is not enough.<br><br>
I wish to look at this matter to see what the most appropriate level would be. As I have explained, if there were two offences and the person was convicted concurrently of both offences, that person could be

fined up to £1,000. Without giving a commitment to the Opposition, I shall look at the level and consider the matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister will clarify my earlier point. Does a public place include a close with a controlled entry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that if someone breaks into a house that has a controlled entry, he is committing an offence. It would certainly be a breach of the peace and, depending upon the circumstances, he could be charged with another offence. The hon. Lady is asking whether it is a public place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about an individual's home and the door to that home. I am talking about a tenement staircase with a controlled entry door to the entire staircase shared by all the tenants. I know that the Minister has seldom entered such premises, but he may understand what I am talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her kind comment. I have been in council houses in the hon. Lady's constituency. In my professional life I have been sent to council houses in the hon. Member's constituency to take evidence from persons in connection with divorce cases. Also, of course, a large proportion of my constituents live in council houses, but the majority have purchased them, which may be one of the reasons why I am a representative here today.<br><br>
I refer the hon. Lady to subsections (6)(a) and (b) which make it quite clear that that matter is covered. It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) any place to which the public have access … and (b) any place to which the public do not have access but to which the persons mentioned … have unlawfully gained access."</p></blockquote>
That means that the circumstances that the hon. Member mentioned are fully covered in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to press the matter. They could have gained access to the close in which they live and be consuming alcohol on that staircase. In that case they would not have gained unlawful access to the staircase because they live there, but they would be committing a nuisance to other tenants by drinking on the staircase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that would be covered by subsection (6)(a). They might be charged under a different head. There is a charge of malicious mischief. For the breach of peace or nuisance they would be caught either under the common law or under subsection (6)(a) or (b).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comments. I wish to make a number of comments of my own. I thank the hon. Member for North Tayside for his constructive approach. The hon. Member for Ayr tries to win at all times. He mentioned early in his speech that my amendment would be forcing children into criminality, but the Government amendment has been accepted and the hon. Gentleman's logic would drive him to the point of accusing the Government of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0236">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
forcing people into criminality. The amendment simply creates a differential in the penalty so that the Committee and Parliament can send a message out loud and clear to the communities in Scotland. It is only with that in mind.<br><br>
On the question of level 2 and level 4 fines, I still expect proportionality to be introduced because the Bill says that there could be a conviction by a fine not exceeding level 2. There is therefore a range of penalties up to the maximum. I am simply introducing that differential in penalty and recognising the proportionality that is there.<br><br>
I accept what the Minister says about relatively few people being charged and we would think it absurd if someone was fined £2,500 for not giving his name and address. We are concerned about drinking throughout Scotland—where there are byelaws and where there are not byelaws. It is with that constructive approach in mind—building on what Opposition Back Benchers have done over the past few years—that we ask the Minister to consider the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already told the Committee that I shall look at the levels, without giving any commitment. That is as far as I can go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his undertaking to look at the levels of fines. He said earlier, when speaking about the level 4 fine—which I believe is £2,500—that that would be an excessive amount for an unemployed person to pay. From that, I take it that he is saying that, under these provisions, the courts will apply fines in accordance with income: the unemployed will be fined at the bottom of the range, those with a middle-range income will be fined in the midle of the scale and someone like him will be fined in excess of £2,500. It is obviously not enough for him to pay £2,500, given his huge income, not only from his ministerial salary, but from his landed estates in Scotland. Will the Minister clarify for the Committee exactly how the courts will decide the levels of fine? Will it be in accordance with the offender's ability to pay or will it be related to the severity of the offence or the number of times a person has been convicted of the offence?<br><br>
Earlier we were speaking about gaining access to controlled-entry closes—it took the Minister a while to understand what they were. The Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill that if someone had illegally gained entry to a controlled entry, that would be an offence. Can he confirm that that is the case? During elections, canvassers often gain access to such closes without getting permission. People can push a wee service button to get in at certain hours of the day. Would that be an illegal act? Would canvassers be acting beyond the law if they took that action? Will the Minister clarify his remark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might be better to ask that question outwith the Committee proceedings.<br><br>
Is discussion of the amendments exhausted? I seem to be listening to tedious repetition now.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand your reservations, Mr. Martin, but there are a couple of points on which I seek clarification from the Minister. He specifically said that his reservation about the hon. Member for Dumbarton's proposals was that, given the circumstances, they were too tough. There is a lack of clarity about the definition of the "public places" to which the amendments might apply.<br><br>
It is my understanding that, if someone is drinking in his front garden, to which the public do not have access, a fine could not be applied, but an offence could be committed and a fine could apply in a communal back garden. I am thinking of tenement blocks, where the back court can be shared by as many as six or eight families, and of multi-storey properties, particularly those with deck access. Where there is a concierge system—with outside locks where permission has to be gained for entry—would deck access levels count as a public place to which somebody has gained access? I have no objection to people drinking inside their houses, but frequently young people can be found running about the decks with alcohol. In Glasgow, where there are universally drink-free zones, it is important to know the level of penalties that would be applied, or whether any should be applied at all.<br><br>
Is the Minister aware of circumstances in which drink is being sold in drink-free zones on a commercial basis to youngsters, who then consume it? I am thinking of at least one case in my constituency where drink has been sold out of the back of a van to under-18s, clearly as part of a commercial enterprise. I understand that the drink has been brought from the continent duty free and is then being sold on to youngsters. In those circumstances, severe penalties up to the £2,500 that the Minister mentioned are appropriate, as it is not simply a question of one individual who has an alcohol problem sharing a bottle of beer with a youngster who should not be there anyway. It is part of a deliberate enterprise, and I should have thought that a heavier fine would be entirely appropriate. That, again, is evidence that the Minister either does not understand what is happening or is being soft on those who seek to peddle drink to under-18s.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to come back into the debate, but I want to raise a genuine point with the Minister. We are not dealing with the Bill but with amendments Nos. 322 and 323, which refer to byelaws currently in force across Scotland. I think that it was my hon. Friend the Minister for Dumbarton who said that across Scotland 16 areas have designated alcohol-free zones.<br><br>
The key consideration is the definition of a public place. It does not matter how clause 53(6)(a) or (b) defines a public place. What matters is how the byelaws define it. We are arguing about the amendments without adequate knowledge of the byelaws. Each byelaw in each part of Scotland may say something different. The level 4 fine of £2,500, which can be levied on those under 18 if they are found drinking in a public place in any of those areas, will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0237">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
depend on what the byelaws say is a public place. Controlled entry closes may well not be included as public places. As far as I am aware, when the Dundee byelaws refer to public places they mean genuine public places such as city centres, main roads, thoroughfares and so on, and not entries to closes, gardens or some parts of the city. That is one of the problems.<br><br>
These are legitimate points that we want to be clear about before we consider whether the Committee should vote on the amendments. We want to know about the levels of fine. Will the Minister clarify his remarks about fines being levied in accordance with a person's income? We also want to know exactly how the byelaws define a public place, because, as I understand it, no local authority is allowed to implement the byelaws unless it has properly consulted the Scottish Office. Therefore, the Scottish Office should know what is meant by a public place in the byelaws that are in force across Scotland. Will the Minister clarify those points for the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Courts must take into account the means of the person concerned. A fine level means that the court can impose a fine up to that level but not above. The definition of a public place includes a place to which the public have unlawfully gained entry, so a person who breaks into a close which is controlled will be caught by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked some questions and I want to answer.<br><br>
I was asked about drinks sold from vans. That is an offence for anybody who does not have a licence under the 1976 Act and it carries substantial penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How much are the penalties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can easily find the penalties under that Act, but we are discussing whether the penalty of £2,500 is appropriate. I do not believe that it is, but I am prepared to reconsider the levels in the context of the amendment. What is and what is not a public place is clearly a matter of common sense, and the courts are well able to determine the question. I have no doubt that back greens to which people generally have access would constitute a public place; a private garden would not.</span></p>

DRIVING DISQUALIFICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.(1) After section 248 of the 1995 Act there shall be inserted the following sections—

<p>248A.—(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, the court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence may, in addition to or instead of dealing with him in any other way, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence to drive a motor vehicle granted under Part III of the Road Traffic Act 1988 for such period as it thinks fit.

<li>Where the person is convicted of an offence for which the sentence is fixed by law, subsection (1) above shall have effect as if the words 'or instead of were omitted.</li>
<li>Subsections (2) and (4) of section 248 of this Act shall apply for the purposes of this section as they apply for the purposes of that section.</li>

<li>Where this section applies, the court may, instead of imposing such a period of imprisonment as is mentioned in subsection (1) above, order that where the offender is in default he shall be disqualified from holding a licence to drive a motor vehicle granted under Part III of the Road Traffic Act 1988 for such determinate period as the court thinks fit.</li>
<li>Where an order has been made under subsection (2) above in default of payment of any fine, or any part of instalment of a fine—</li>

<br><blockquote><p>section 248B (driving disqualification for fine defaulters) so far as it relates to the power conferred by section 219(1)(b).'.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>—[<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
New section 248A extends the availability of the penalty of disqualification from driving. Removing the freedom to drive is already an effective penalty for various road traffic offences. We believe that disqualification from driving can usefully be used more widely and that its extension in this manner would give the courts an additional powerful tool when considering the most appropriate way to deal with offenders.<br><br>
New section 248B extends the penalty of disqualification from driving to include punishment for fine default. In doing so, we create yet another noncustodial option for dealing with fine defaulters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something occurred to me as the Minister made his remarks about why it was necessary to introduce the new clause. He said that it would provide an alternative to prison for persons suffering from fine defualt. If they cannot afford to pay the fine, how can they afford to run a car? Secondly, if people are employed, for example, as drivers and are trying to pay off a fine, would it not be contradictory to move
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
them from their employment, making it even more difficult for them to pay the fine for which they are liable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that people generally cherish the freedom to drive and that disqualification from driving would prove to be an effective addition to the measures already available of enforcing fines without the need to commit fine defaulters to prison. One of the points made repeatedly by the Opposition has been that prison should not be overloaded with fine defaulters. I accept that it is better to have non-custodial options.<br><br>
The purpose of all fine enforcement measures is to make the offender pay the fine that has been imposed by the court as punishment for the offence or offences. The period of disqualification, therefore, would be reduced proportionately if the offender paid off part of the outstanding fine and be expunged completely if he paid off the whole fine.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks how someone who was being difficult about paying a fine would have access to vehicles. Sometimes people take vehicles without permission; it does happen. We believe that a prolonged period of disqualification is an effective deterrent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not listen. First, if people take vehicles without permission they do not need a licence; they will do it whether they have a licence or not, so that does not arise. The real problem I have with the new clause is this: will the Minister give an assurance that it is not the Government's intention that people who are employed as drivers, who make their living as drivers, who depend for their income on driving, will not have their licence removed because they have not paid their fines? It would be impossible for them to pay their fines and they would end up in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The courts will necessarily take properly into account all the circumstances of the case, including the fact that driving may be someone's livelihood, when they determine the suitable disposal of a case. I am not here to sign a blank cheque on anyone's behalf, and not for those on whose behalf the hon. Gentleman is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not asking the Minister to sign a blank cheque; I am asking him to put on the parliamentary record that it is not the Government's intention that the courts should use that power in order to deprive people of their employment when they are in default of fines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I leave that to the discretion of the courts. It depends on the circumstances of the case. There may be aggravating circumstances, which they are properly entitled to take into accout. The hon. Gentleman is saying that it is indeed a strong deterrent. If someone is a professional driver, the threat of having his licence taken away if he commits a serious transgression is serious for him.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A person may have been employed for a considerable time and then find that the only offer of employment open to him is a job driving for a company; that would help him to pay off any fine or other debt. The Minister has rejected the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East on the ground that he wants to leave it to the discretion of the courts. The very fact that we pass laws stating levels of fines and so forth in Committees means that we do not give total discretion to the courts. We are prepared to set parameters within which the courts have discretion. I see no reason why there should not be written into the Bill a provision that it should not be an acceptable form of punishment for someone who is trying to find work or who already has work and needs that work in order to be able to pay the fine. The Government's case is nonsense, and Parliament should say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are other disposals the courts can use, such as supervised attendence orders or community service orders. I am completely content to leave it to the discretion of the courts. But there is no doubt that disqualification from driving for a prolonged period is a very powerful deterrent. We believe that it should be within the discretion of the courts to use it in appropriate circumstances.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ADMISSIBILITY FOR PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDREN'S HEARING</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—After section 44 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 there shall be inserted the following section—
<br><blockquote><p>"Admissibility of proceedings in connections with childrens hearing.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>44A. No evidence of any statment or admission made in the course of a children's hearing or proceedings in connection with a hearing children's hearing under this Part of this Act shall be admissible in any criminal proceedings, whether under this Act or otherwise, except
<ol>
<li>where those other proceedings take place under Part II or III of this Act.</li>
<li>in relation to a charge of perjury; or</li>
<li>as evidence of the fact that the statement or admission was made.".'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
New clause 2 arises out of the discussion in the Scottish all-party parliamentary group on children where we recently had the benefit of information given to us by the reporter to the children's panel about the conduct of proceedings relating to children, whether those children have committed offences or are victims of offences. The new clause arises because of a difficulty of which we learned in the all-party committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
Section 44 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 relates to the prohibition of publication of proceedings at children's hearings. That provision had the full support of everyone on the Children (Scotland) Bill Standing Committee because we thought particularly about newspapers giving lurid accounts of what went on at a children's hearing for the sake of having a dramatic story to tell that could harm the child's interests. However, problems have arisen that I hope the new clause will address.<br><br>
In effect, we seek to introduce a statutory guarantee of confidentiality in relation to children's proceedings. The Crown has never sought to lead evidence about such statements or admissions, except in relation to a charge of perjury or, for instance, a charge of breach of the peace in relation to actual or apprehended conduct during a hearing; the latter situation should be covered by the second exception in the new clause.<br><br>
The statutory guarantee of confidentiality would ease the dilemma in which parents facing concurrent prosecution on child abuse or neglect grounds currently find themselves. Many such parents want to talk honestly with the children's hearing about their difficulties, but they feel themselves in a quandary. Because of the lack of any overt guarantee of confidentiality, they are frightened to say what they would like to in order to seek help to overcome their own poblems and to help their children overcome the difficulties that have arisen in the family. My remarks relate to parents who genuinely want to become better parents, but I know that some exploit the situation to evade answering important questions. They say, "This evidence may come up in court." Although those conducting the children's hearing may say that it will not, they ask, "Where is my guarantee that it won't?"<br><br>
A further outcome of the proposal would be to prevent the wholly inappropriate, but far from unknown, citation of children's panel members in matrimonial cases, usually to explain past children's hearing decisions, with the hope of supporting one parent's case while undermining the other's. That is important because no one foresaw it.<br><br>
Children's panel members, because of their sense of civic duty and their wish to help children, do not expect to be hauled into the divorce court as a witness for one or the other partner, but that has apparently been happening and we want to prevent it. They must be able to do their work helping children without feeling that they can then be forced to be a witness in such cases.<br><br>
I hope that that is sufficient explanation of why the new clause I ask would be useful and I ask the Minister to support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Member's wish to remove any inhibition some parents may have about speaking openly and frankly to children's hearings which are considering the welfare of their child, while criminal proceedings—for example, involving charges of child abuse or neglect—are proceeding. However, the proposals seek to amend the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 as if it dealt with criminal proceedings. As hon. Members may be aware,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
all the proceedings under that Act are civil proceedings in which the welfare of the child is always the paramount consideration.<br><br>
In so far as it may have any effect, the new clause would all too clearly benefit some parents, but would certainly not always benefit children. I fear that it seeks to introduce not only a change into the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, but a provision that would run counter to the principle of the Act that the welfare of the child is paramount. I am sure that that is not the intention, but that would be the effect. Put shortly, the effect of the amendment would be that even if it were to be in the interests of the child concerned for evidence of what took place at a children's hearing to be led in criminal proceedings, that could not be done because the evidence, however valuable, would be inadmissible in law.<br><br>
I am sure that that is not the effect that the hon. Lady wants and it is certainly not what the Government would be prepared to accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The intention of the amendment is precisely to help children; it is not counter to the principle underlining the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. If parents are afraid to be frank and open at children's hearings because they fear the consequences in the criminal courts, how will that help children's hearings to help children? That is what we are driving at.<br><br>
The new clause may be unacceptable for technical reasons, but I would be happy if the Minister would accept the principle that, far from negating the principle of the Act, we are trying to help further. We want children's hearings to be able to hear the full story and to press parents to provide more information on the factors that may have given rise to the situation that caused the children to appear before the hearing. Without the amendment, the consequences that I described will follow, and parents may refuse to cooperate with children's hearings.<br><br>
The Minister has not responded to the other reason for the new clause—that the members of children's panels might be cited in matrimonial cases. Does he agree that that would be an inappropriate outcome because parents do not join children's panels expecting that to happen? I would be pleased if the Minister could find another way of overcoming those problems, but I hope that he will not reject the new clause out of hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions that have arisen in connection with the new clause, which I support. I am advised—I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments—that, in practice, the Crown has never sought to lead evidence on statements and admissions except in relation to charges of perjury or breaches of the peace that occur during the hearing, which are particular circumstances. If it is the Crown's practice not to do that, the new clause would put that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
into statutory form and would extend protection for vulnerable witnesses. I shall be interested in the Minister's comments on the practice of the Crown.<br><br>
It is important to think in terms of vulnerable witnesses. There are various examples of proceedings at children's hearings which are not the same as proceedings in court. I have not been involved in children's hearings so I must rely on what I am told by others, but I understand that the restrictions on cross-examination of the complainer in sexual offences cases does not apply at children's hearings. Someone who was being questioned and examined along those lines at a children's hearing would be in a worse position than someone in court because the protection would not apply at childrens' hearing. In theory, it would be possible to take admissions obtained under those circumstances and to import them into a court where it would not have been possible to obtain them. I should like clarification, because that seems to be the kind of anomaly that the clause would close. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments, because the clause seems intended to close a loophole and to provide a statutory guarantee of confidentiality, which appears in practice to be recognised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss the issue of vulnerable witnesses on the next group of new clauses, so I shall come back to that.<br><br>
This is a complex and sensitive issue which merits careful consideration. Present prosecution policy is based on a presumption that statements or admissions made in the course of a children's hearing will not be used in criminal proceedings unless there are compelling and special reasons why, in the public interest, they should be used. Therefore, Crown counsel's instructions must always be obtained before any such step is taken.<br><br>
Parents are compellable as witnesses to give evidence to the children's panel. In other words, if a parent saw a serious crime being committed against a child, he could be compelled to give evidence to the children's panel. It would certainly have to be a very serious matter before evidence given to a children's panel in a criminal case could be brought before a court. Cases can go to the High Court when the circumstances are sufficiently serious and severe.<br><br>
The present policy is based on an acknowledgment that proceedings before the children's hearing are child-centred and that the knowledge that evidence is likely to be used in criminal proceedings would alter the atmosphere of such proceedings. There are also questions of fairness to the accused and the status of any such admissions in the absence of a caution or judicial warning.<br><br>
Against that background, we consider it right to reserve ultimate discretion in the matter to the Lord Advocate, acting in the public interest, so that in extremely serious cases, where a prosecution might be periled on an admission made in a hearing, due consideration may be given to using such evidence.<br><br>
I was in the High Court when a group of youths were charged with kicking a young man to death. A very young child gave evidence that he was one of them. When counsel put it to the child that there had been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
family pressure to give false evidence, the child broke down in the witness box and said that that was true. There are sometimes very serious cases, but the presumption, as I told the hon. Member for Maryhill earlier, is that statements made in the course of a children's hearing will not be used in criminal proceedings. The circumstances must be very severe before that presumption is reached.<br><br>
If questions about an accused person's sexual history are asked at a hearing and those questions could not be used in a criminal trial, the Crown will not use such evidence. Our policy and our belief is that it is right that the Lord Advocate should have ultimate discretion, acting in the public interest, although it is a discretion that he would use only in the most serious and severe cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right about one thing: this is a complex matter and I would not want us to hasten to a judgment without more careful reflection. But he mentioned several other aspects that make me feel I must press him a bit further.<br><br>
Although a person can be compelled to give full information to a children's hearing, it would seem from the experience of reporters, not of members of the Committee, that some people are nevertheless managing to evade doing that on the ground that they are frightened to say anything in case they incriminate themselves in a future criminal process in the High Court. The children's hearing system is child-centred. The amendment aims to make it more so. We want to ensure that people can be made to speak frankly, without fear that whatever they say may be used in evidence against them.<br><br>
Most people are not sophisticated enough to know anything about an absence of caution or of a judicial warning. They do not spend much of their lives in court and so may not be aware of that protection. Such issues may seldom arise, but this Parliament has not hesitated to deal with other issues that seldom arise.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
In light of the fact that the reporters to the children's panel were concerned about the issue, if I withdraw the new clause, will the Minister undertake at least to consider the issue with the reporters? Will he be willing to return to the subject if he feels convinced by the reporters' case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always glad to hear from the reporters. However, I should not be prepared to take any action that I believe would undermine the powers of the Lord Advocate to act in the public interest in cases where the circumstances are very severe and serious crimes have been committed. It would be wrong to prejudice the role of the Lord Advocate acting in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is saying that, with that proviso, he is willing to discuss the issue with the reporters to the children's panels, I should be glad to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<li>in solemn proceedings, at any time before the oath is administered to the jury:</li>
<li>in summary proceedings, at any time before the first witness is sworn:</li>
<li>in exceptional circumstances in either solemn or summary proceedings during the course of the trial,</li>

</ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to have more success with new clause 5. At present, child witnesses who are considered too young to take the oath are subject to approved quality tests of their competency to give evidence. The judge has to be persuaded that the child understands the difference between truth and lies and that he or she promises to tell the truth.<br><br>
That practice is firmly embedded in case law. However, it is objectionable because a child under the age of seven cannot be expected to grasp abstract concepts like truth. That does not reflect how young people think. However, very young children have the capacity to know whether what they are saying is true. They are capable of knowingly telling the truth. To be subjected to a test in the manner that currently exists, however, might frighten them into silence and make them unable to say anything useful.<br><br>
In practice, judges frequently experience great difficulty in explaining the tests in a way that a child can understand and respond to. As a result, many children are disqualified from giving evidence because of a failure in communication. That is particularly the case with a judge who may not be accustomed to speaking to young children in the course of his or her daily life. I offer as anecdotal evidence the example of a judge who thought that, if he removed his wig he would make himself more friendly in appearance and would encourage a four-year-old to give evidence. However, the child went into a screaming fit: he was frightened because he thought that the judge had suddenly taken off all his hair.<br><br>
People might not be aware of difficulties in communication because they do not spend much time with young children. That is important, because there have been too many cases where a young child has been the victim of appalling crimes, especially sexual abuse and, where, because of technical difficulties, their evidence has been disregarded. Therefore whoever committed that crime managed to get off. We should be doing all we can to ensure that a child is helped to give evidence in a clear manner and is understood.<br><br>
I must point out that the test is discriminatory. Witnesses who take the oath or affirm are never asked whether they understand either the concept of truth or the terms of the oath. In many cases both must be questionable, and the courts are well accustomed to dealing with this as a matter of credibility in the light of the evidence given.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
The new clause does not refer specifically to children, although it would be especially useful in the case of young children. It could be applied to an adult witness with a severe learning impairment. Again, there have been unfortunate cases cited by the media recently of people with severe learning impairment who have been abused and whose evidence has been disregarded. The new clause attempts to make sure that the evidence of young children and people with a learning impairment is not disregarded and that they are given a full opportunity to say what they have to say so that a judge can still weigh up whether their evidence is worthy of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address my comments to new clauses 7, 8 and 16. Enable has been campaigning for years for the provisions in new clauses 7 and 8 and has been involved with a number of parliamentarians. New clause 7 is in the name of Labour Members of the Committee as well as those of the hon. Members for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). On Second Reading they referred to the "Frontline Scotland" report on a rape case in Ayrshire and have a history of being involved in this issue. Indeed, like me, the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow was a member of the Committee considering the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill 1993 when we moved a number of amendments dealing with vulnerable witnesses. The Government said that it was too early to assess them and that we should return to the matter at a later date. That assessment has taken place and Enable and others think that the need for action is now urgent.<br><br>
It is with that in mind that these new clauses have been tabled. Their purpose is to allow victims of crime who have learning disabilities or mental health problems the same protection in giving evidence as is available to children.<br><br>
The problems faced by witnesses who are vunerable because of learning disability or mental illness are severe, as was dramatically highlighted by the "Frontline Scotland" report. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Scotland confirmed that he would be happy to consider the matter in Committee. We hope that something positive will emerge from our debate this morning and that the Government will take action.<br><br>
The "Frontline Scotland" report concerned the alleged rape by a former caseworker of no fewer than four women at a home in Ayrshire. No prosecution was brought, apparently because the women had learning difficulties, although one of the alleged victims spoke in the programme in graphic terms of her experiences.<br><br>
That is unacceptable. If it were a one-off, it would be a matter of regret, but, sadly, that case is not unique. I remind the Minister that, in August 1995, a former nurse was convicted of raping four women with learning disabilities, who lived at the hospital where he worked.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
Research carried out by the University of Kent at Canterbury suggests that in Scotland at least 100 people with learning disabilities are the victims of sexual abuse every year, but there is a conviction in only a handful of cases. One reason for that is that the trial process is intimidating and confusing for vulnerable witnesses. It seems that cases have been dropped to spare the victim the ordeal of giving evidence but surely, as Enable suggests, the response of the law should be to minimise the ordeal so that people can give evidence. During consideration of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill, the Minister referred to the issue of best evidence, and some progress was made as a result of the introduction of that concept. We support the principle of best evidence, but we also support the need for the difficulties of victims to be debated by the court in the most non-confrontational way possible.<br><br>
The new clause would do that by allowing witnesses with learning disabilities or mental health problems the same protection as child witnesses. It would allow the person to give evidence behind a screen, by a live video link, or by a statement recorded on video before trial. The screens and video links would help witnesses, who could be intimidated by being confronted by their abuser or by the artificial and frightening setting of a court room, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill has already said.<br><br>
A pre-trial statement would be especially useful where a person's ability to hold peripheral details in her memory over the long period before a trial may be limited. As long ago as 1990, the Scottish Law Commission recommended that those measures should be available to vulnerable adult witnesses. Indeed, the Opposition have offered their support to the proposal that the Scottish Grand Committee should examine such issues, which straddle party-political debate. There is an all-party element to this.<br><br>
In 1993, attempts were made to introduce these measures into the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill, but the Minister argued that it was premature to do so until the provisions for children had been evaluated. I can give the Committee the references for that in <i>Hansard</i> of 16 December 1992 at columns 460–466 and 19 November 1992 at columns 239–246. That research has now taken place and has confirmed that the new procedures should stay and be improved. Giving the same protection to vulnerable adults is long overdue.<br><br>
However, it must be acknowledged, as Enable has emphasised, that, even if the new clause is accepted, it is only one step in the right direction and not a solution to cases such as the one in Ayrshire. The research into child witnesses confirmed that many other problems need to be addressed, including long delays before trials and witnesses being unable to say all they want to say because they are baffled by the questions or because the structure of the questioning prevents them from giving a full description.<br><br>
If we want to make sure that a case such as the one in Ayrshire does not recur, it will be necessary for the Lord Advocate to initiate a fundamental review of the many ways in which the system makes it difficult for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0244">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
the victims of crime who are mentally disordered to receive justice, from the initial police investigations to the trial. The Opposition would be most co-operative in assisting the Government in that process.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
New clause 8 has to do with police interviews with mentally disordered persons. We are asking the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice in connection with the detention, treatment and questioning of mentally disordered persons by police officers. There was a case in Scotland a couple of months ago—the Quigley case. An individual with learning difficulties was not interviewed properly by the police and the case was dropped. Mrs. Quigley wrote to me about the case. I phoned her back and promised that when this issue was debated in Committee, as I knew it would be, I would raise the case. We need to remind ourselves when we are debating new clauses such as this one of the impact that such events have on people's lives. The distressing experience will be remembered for their entire lives.<br><br>
New clause 8 is looking for statutory guidelines for police interviews of people who are mentally disordered. The need for clear procedures when police interview a witness or suspect who may have a learning disability or mental health problems is urgent. As I mentioned, a lack of a framework was highlighted in the recent Quigley case.<br><br>
Mr. Quigley, who has a learning disability, was accused of the murder of a young boy. The case collapsed when the judge held that his alleged confession to police had been unfairly obtained and was not admissible as evidence. For the benefit of <i>Hansard,</i> it was the victim's mother who wrote to me; I may have made a mistake in what I said earlier.<br><br>
As long ago as 1990, the Government issued a circular to chief constables recommending that interviews with mentally disordered witnesses should be conducted in the presence of an independent third party known as an "appropriate adult". Moreover, unlike in England and Wales, that circular was only advisory and had no statutory force.<br><br>
Since then, some police forces, such as Fife, have worked with social work departments and health services to develop a clear framework to ensure that appropriate adults are available when a person with a mental disorder is being interviewed. But that has not become universal. In Strathclyde, where the Quigley case occurred, discussions about such a scheme seem to have been a victim of local government reorganisation, which has led to one police force having to negotiate with 12 social work departments and four health boards.<br><br>
That litany was exposed during debates on the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill. The need for some urgent action is important in the light of what local government reorganisation has done to produce such a lack of coherence in a case such as that.<br><br>
Given the lack of progress in most of Scotland over the past six years, it is clear that the Minister will have to be very positive in his comments this morning. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
Government must ensure that all police officers have at least a basic training in recognising the signs of mental disorder and are aware of the importance of involving an appropriate adult. They must also know where they can find an appropriate adult. That means that there must be some central direction on who should organise appropriate adult schemes and how people should be recruited, trained and monitored.<br><br>
A properly functioning appropriate adult scheme would not only be relevant in the case of a suspect who is mentally disordered; as recent events have shown, people with learning difficulties are regularly victims of crime and abuse. All too often, such cases are not pursued because the victim is unable to give a clear statement to the police. The appropriate adult scheme would help the police to obtain evidence in a way that was not just fairer but more likely to be reliable.<br><br>
That statutory framework is extremely important. There is a case in my constituency where an individual is involved in a case of alleged rape. That person has been to the police and to the procurator fiscal, but the case has been dropped, and the person has been left with a sore heart. They came to their Member of Parliament to see whether anything could be done, but there is nothing that we can do for someone who has been through the whole process up to the procurator fiscal. We must deal with the heartache and frustration that people feel as a result. I should like the Minister to address his remarks to that issue this morning.<br><br>
New clause 16 introduces a new provision for dealing with vulnerable witnesses in court. As mentioned earlier, the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 contained provisions for taking evidence from children—concealing them behind by a screen—which were consolidated in section 271 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. It is therefore appropriate that similar special provision should be made for other vulnerable witnesses who may, through illness or age, be put under stress by the court processes and whose experience could be enhanced by this provision.<br><br>
I look forward to hearing positive responses on the three new clauses from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are extremely important new clauses and I shall seek to do justice to them.<br><br>
First, when we consider new clause 5, it is important to bear in mind that the competence of witnesses is a matter which informs both civil and criminal procedure. Of necessity, given the scope of the Bill, any new clause of the type tabled by the hon. Member for Maryhill would apply only in criminal procedure, thereby leaving the position in civil procedure out of step. That could lead to an unsatisfactory situation. For that reason alone I am not persuaded that the new clause should be accepted. Whatever the arguments in its favour, I fear that it does not achieve what the hon. Lady intends. It certainly could not assist child witnesses in proceedings relating to children's hearings, as those procedures are civil in character. However, I agree to discuss this matter with my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 423</span>
The Government recognise that there may be an issue in relation to the test currently applied by the court to assess competence of witnesses, particularly child witnesses. Although the new clause does not deal precisely with that issue but purely with the mechanical issue of the administration of an oath, the Government feel that there may be substantial arguments for reconsidering the question of competence, particularly in relation to child witnesses in both criminal an civil proceedings.<br><br>
Mrs. Kathleen Murray's report into the use of the closed-circuit television technique for child witnesses recommended that the matter be investigated. The Government are prepared to consider reforms, but only after the fullest and most detailed consultation with the relevant interests. That would have to involve considerations of civil as well as criminal procedure, which the hon. Lady's new clause does not do. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the motion.<br><br>
Of all the new clauses that Opposition Members have tabled, new clause 7 is the one which, in principle, most commends itself to the Government. I congratulate the hon. Member for Dumbarton on his attempt to come to terms with a complex and difficult issue. By raising it in the form of the new clause, he affords us the opportunity of taking the matter forward in the Bill.<br><br>
However, I regret that the Government cannot accept the new clause as it stands. It is restricted to witnesses who are suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. Even within that definition, the category of witnesses that would be protected by the clause is restricted, as it does not include witnesses suffering from any form of mental impairment. Even if we were to focus on that section of that Act as the source of the definition, it is the view of my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate, who, as Opposition Members will know, has taken a particular interest in this matter, that not many witnesses would look legitimately for protection by the courts if we were to take this initiative forward. However, my right hon. and learned Friend will be interested in looking at a definition which would allow those with learning disabilities to be afforded protection.<br><br>
For that reason I hope that the hon. Member for Dumbarton will choose not to press the new clause. I undertake that the Lord Advocate will bring back a revised clause to be considered in the other place after due consultation and consideration of the clause.<br><br>
New Clause 8 seeks to provide in statute a formal code of practice. The case of Mr Quigley does pose questions about police procedures to deal with those who are mentally disordered. We are looking urgently at that case to see what lessons should be learnt from it.<br><br>
The proposal is that a formal code of practice would prescribe the exact arrangements that police officers would be required to follow when questioning persons who suffer from a mental disorder. Any officer failing to comply with such a code would be subject to disciplinary action. The hon. Member for Dumbarton has proposed that such a code of practice should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 424</span>
admissible as evidence in court and should be required to be taken into account in determinig relevant questions during court proceedings.<br><br>
I understand that the new clause has been sponsored by Enable, whose legal and policy adviser has written to me offering to discuss his proposal with officials. That would be helpful and I have accepted the offer. I expect to be able to make speedy progress thereafter and to report back to the House. In those circumstances I invite the hon. Member not to press the new clause.<br><br>
New Clause 16 would give a very wide discretion to the courts with regard to the use of the special proceedings for the taking of children's evidence under section 271 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. However, the new clause which derives its origin, I suspect, from the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission contains very little guidance to the courts as to the criteria which should be applied when considering whether to exercise the discretion.<br><br>
It is for that reason that my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate, having considered carefully the recommendations made by the Scottish Law Commission, decided that they were too wide and that it was not in the interests of justice that they be implemented as they stood. However, as I have already said in relation to new Clause 7, the Government are prepared to consider applying the provisions relating to children to adult witnesses who come within a category of those with learning disabilities and for that reason the Lord Advocate is preparing to engage in a short consultation on the matter before bringing forward new provisions. I hope that that will be enough to satisfy Opposition Members that the Government are alive to the needs of those witnesses who really need protection, while not wishing to open the door to the use of these proceedings by a very wide category of witneses without there being a compelling argument in its favour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has expresed support for the general principle of what is being attempted. We certainly want to overcome the problem that is becoming increasingly evident of people with learning difficulties and young children not being protected by the court. Because they are unable to satisfy the current tests their evidence is not taken into account. That is appalling. It would lead child abusers and paedophiles to target young children specifically because they would be more likely to get away with it.<br><br>
The Minister said that if the new clause was accepted, it would be out of step with civil procedure. I recognise the logic of what he says, but at the same time, it is impossible for us to put both in step together. Surely it is for civil procedure to come into line at some future stage with what we are attempting to do in criminal procedure, rather than for children who are victims of abusers and others to have to wait until civil procedure is sorted out. I hope that that will not be a cause for delay.<br><br>
I am glad that the Minister has undertaken to discuss this with the Lord Advocate and with other relevant persons. Is he prepared to attempt to bring

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 425</span>
forward the result of such discussions in time for the Report stage? If it is not cleared up in the Bill, I cannot imagine how many years will go by before it is sorted out for children and vulnerable adults. Time is of the essence and I hope that the Minister will undertake to do that.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a comment on what the Minister said about the way in which he intends to handle new clause 7 and new clause 8. There is a different prognosis on each clause. I understand that he accepts new clause 7 in principle, but will discuss it with the Lord Advocate who will bring forward a revised new clause in the House of Lords. Therefore, it will make its way into the Bill and on to the statute book. We welcome that very much.<br><br>
The Minister did not say that in respect of new clause 8. All he said was that he would discuss it with the legal adviser to Enable and that, thereafter, he wished to make speedy progress and report back to the House. That suggests to me that he has no intention of introducing a revised new clause 8 for inclusion in the Bill in the House of Lords or on Report. He will simply report back to the House at some stage.<br><br>
Realistically, there will not be another legislative opportunity during this Parliament to introduce legislation to implement new clause 8. Will the Minister tell us precisely what he intends to do about new clause 8 and when he intends to do it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made inquiries on that point. I have offered to report back to the House once we have considered whether a code as proposed by Enable is the best way forward or whether we should proceed by non-statutory guidance. I believe that the police need clear guidelines. The only question is whether that should be done by statutory guidelines. We will go into it thoroughly. I am not convinced at this stage that the legislation is necessary, but we will go into the discussions with an open mind.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumbarton asked about an appropriate adult being available in relation to new clause 8. I agree that the police should always ensure that an appropriate adult is present when a mentally disordered person is being interviewed. We will take that up with the police after discussing with Enable.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked when the amendment would be tabled. I mentioned earlier that it would be tabled by the Lord Advocate in the other place after consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his positive comments on new clause 7. We look forward to the Lord Advocate drafting a new clause to be incorporated on Report on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has already spoken about new clause 8. That is a legal sore in Scotland at the moment with the collapse of the Quigley case. I remind the Minister that in 1990 the Government issued a non-statutory circular to chief constables recommending that interviews should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 426</span>
conducted in the presence of an independent third party. Six years later, the Quigley case in Strathclyde collapsed because the judge said that the alleged confession to the police had been unfairly obtained and was not admissible as evidence. As a circular or as advice, that has plainly not worked over six years. As my hon. Friend has said, this is the last opportunity before the general election to incorporate it into legislation.<br><br>
I do not see any need for the Government to stall on that issue. After all, only two years ago in the White Paper "Firm and Fair", the Government said that a review of the appropriate adult scheme was under way and the outcome would be known in the autumn of 1994. Two years later, nothing has emerged from the Scottish Office. Surely the Minister could look at the clause with Enable and give a firmer opinion that he will be able to incorporate something like it when we return to the Floor of the House, because it is a running sore and because of the recent Quigley case.<br><br>
Is the Minister saying that he will look at that with Enable but he will not bring anything forward? In two or three months' time there may be another case like Quigley. It is completely unacceptable. I ask the Minister to ensure that there is a properly functioning appropriate adult scheme that is relevant in the case of a suspect who is mentally disordered. Surely it is not asking too much of the right hon. Gentleman. Will he elaborate his remarks and give us more hope before Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is much that I can add. We shall enter discussions with Enable with an open mind. The matter may be covered effectively by non-statutory guidance; if not, we shall consider tabling an amendment. We shall go into the matter thoroughly with Enable and take note of the points made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton in relation to the case of Mr. Quigley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little? He spoke of non-statutory guidance. That was introduced in 1990 and, six years later, we find that it has not worked. That avenue is not open to the Minister, and we are asking him to recognise the folly of non-statutory guidance and to introduce this framework. People are crying out for it. There is no insurmountable obstacle for the Government. Cannot the Minister apply himself a wee bit more and be more positive in his response, given the failure of non-statutory guidance over the past six years and its dramatic failure in the past few months in Strathclyde?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not saying that we would rely on the present non-statutory guidance; there would clearly have to be further guidance, if that was the avenue to be followed. If it is necessary to table an amendment, we shall do so. We shall go into the discussions with an open mind and report back to the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister will explain what he means by "amendment". He said that if it was necessary to table an amendment, he would do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 427</span>
so. Is the Minister giving an undertaking to bring forward an amendment to the Bill that will allow new clause 8 to be incorporated into it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give an undertaking to ensure that the police will have an appropriate adult present. The police will be anxious to ensure that they take fully into account all the elements relating to the case of Mr. Quigley. When I say "amendment", I am referring to a possible amendment to the Bill, but clearly we shall have full discussions. Then the matter will be taken forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear that I have the same assurances about new clause 5; that after appropriate discussions with the Lord Advocate and others, an amendment will be introduced. The Minister said earlier that that would put us out of step with civil practice. As I said previously, how can we ever be in step? We cannot discuss a Bill that includes both criminal and civil practice. One will always be out of step with the other. Matters will either remain as they are, to keep in line with civil practice, or we shall wait for civil practice to change. Then the Minister will no doubt tell a Committee discussing civil practice that it is not permissible to include it because it is out of line with criminal practice. It is illogical nonsense.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will not delay discussing the matter on the ground that such a move would be out of step with civil practice. If he is prepared, as he said, to discuss it with the Lord Advocate and other eminent bodies and they advise him that it is an appropriate move, will he introduce a suitable amendment on Report? If he is not willing to give that undertaking, when can we ever resolve the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must appreciate that civil matters lie outwith the scope of the Bill. I have said that I shall discuss these matters with the Lord Advocate. I made it clear earlier that the Government are prepared to consider reform, but only after the fullest and most detailed consultation with all the relevant interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that imply that the matter may not be brought back before Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pretend that I can give the hon. Lady a commitment to do so before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is this the last occasion on which we shall be able to discuss new clauses 5 and 8? Is it possible for Opposition Members to reintroduce them on Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Speaker. The Committee deals only with clauses and amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. May I seek your guidance on a procedural matter? I have been told that the new clause is technically out of order, because it does not cover civil practice. We all agree in principle that we want to help vulnerable witnesses and young children, but we are told that we cannot do so because the Bill is not concerned with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
civil law. If a similar amendment were tabled to a Bill covering civil law, we would be told that the Bill does not cover criminal matters, so how can we make progress?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot rule on a hypothetical new clause. I ruled that the matter was within the scope of the Bill. It has been debated and the Minister has said that the new clause is not acceptable to the Government, although it is obviously acceptable to the hon. Lady. I am in the hands of the Committee, which may wish to test the matter with a vote. That is the only option if it is not satisfied with the Minister's assurances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin, I am not asking whether you agree with my new clause. The Minister is saying that it is technically incompetent to discuss civil law when considering a Bill covering criminal law. The same argument will apply whenever a Committee discusses civil law proceedings, so how can we ever make progress?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the hon. Lady what she can do. She can do what she has been doing and table amendments and new clauses. The Clerk will show them to me and we will decide whether they are competent for debate. The new clause is competent for debate in the Committee today, but I cannot worry about other legislation that will be discussed because I may not be chairing the Standing Committee. We are here to discuss the Bill before us, but without tedious repetition. I heard the Minister say that he could give some assurances, but not to the hon. Lady's satisfaction. That is the way of Committees. Sometimes Ministers are reluctant to give assurances and at other times they are over the moon to do so. Perhaps the Minister can help us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I try to be of assistance? It would be competent for a Bill to deal with both criminal and civil evidence, but the Bill before us deals only with the one. I gave the hon. Lady a commitment and promised to discuss the matter with the Lord Advocate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because I would like to tie up the new clauses today. On new clause 8 the Minister has given us some hope that an amendment will be forthcoming, but we are not sure. Perhaps the Minister is not sure. He said that will meet Enable, so will he assure us that he will do so before Report and keep us informed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to meet Enable as soon as possible and I shall report back to the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and clause, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Peter Ainsworth.</i>]</p>
<p>Bill to be further considered on Tuesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Peter Ainsworth.</i>]</p>
