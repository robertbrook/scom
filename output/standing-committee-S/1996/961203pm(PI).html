	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>This day</i>]: No. 259, in page 33, line 7, after "any", insert "convicted".—[	<i>Mr. McAllion.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 260, in page 33, line 8, leave out second "who" and insert "whom".</p>
	<p>No. 262, in page 33, line 13, at end insert "convicted".</p>
	<p>No. 254, in page 33, line 16, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(3) The Scottish Prison Service shall be required to ensure that all prisoners with a problem of alcohol abuse have access to an alcohol education programme during their time in custody.".</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 255, in page 33, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"'Alcohol Education Programme' means a programme of instruction and counselling in relation to the abuse of alcohol which is approved in regulations by the Secretary of State for Scotland.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is contrary to good order or discipline for any prisoner to be under the influence of alcohol. It is also against prison rules for a prisoner to be in possession of alcohol. Those points are just as relevant to prisoners on remand as to convicted prisoners. The need to secure the security and personal safety of inmates applies equally to the unconvicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No disciplinary action would be taken against any prisoner for consuming alcohol before being remanded in custody. Prison staff would be provided with separate guidance on the time taken for alcohol to be eliminated from the body. A remand prisoner would not be charged with a breach of discipline unless it was clear that the alcohol had been consumed while he was in the custody of the Scottish Prison Service. On that basis I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendments Nos. 259 and 262. I am grateful for amendment No. 260, which I invite the Committee to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 254, which I shall consider along with amendment No. 255, is technically defective. The Scottish Prison Service is not a separate legal entity from the Secretary of State and it is he who has legal responsibility for prisoners. More importantly, however, the effect of the proposed amendments would be to oblige the service to follow a model that would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
neither appropriate nor cost effective. I therefore ask the hon. Members in whose names the amendments appear to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for conceding that the grammar was wrong in the clause and for explaining that it will apply to remand prisoners and convicted prisoners equally. The amendments were intended to clarify those points, and the Minister has now provided clarification, which we accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy about the Minister's comments on amendments Nos. 254 and 255, except to the extent that there is perhaps a technical defect, in that the reference to the Scottish Prison Service should have been to the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, that is a technicality with which the Minister could deal if he supported the principle of the amendment. Perhaps the Minister could expand on and explain his view that it is not appropriate or cost effective to try, by means of educational programmes, to deal with alcohol abuse in prison. One would hope that after release people would begin to lead good, orderly lives. I should have thought that education programmes could help them to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sentence planning approach which the Scottish Prison Service has adopted targets prisoners' needs in relation to reoffending. Prisoners are encouraged—and challenged—to confront their offending behaviour. In most cases, prisoners with problems of addiction and alcohol abuse will be able to associate those problems with their offending behaviour. Scarce resources should be targeted on those prisoners whose criminal behaviour is directly related to patterns of abuse or addiction—which is not the same as all prisoners with problems of alcohol abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Prison Service adopts a multidisciplinary approach to alcohol abuse that involves health care and education specialists working collaboratively with residential officers. Alcoholics Anonymous is also involved in most prisons, working with prisoners in groups or providing one-to-one counselling as necessary. The approach suggested by the amendments is too restrictive. An educational model of instruction and counselling would not allow the prison service sufficient scope to respond to the needs of individual prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By providing access to an alcohol education programme for all prisoners with an alcohol-related problem, rather than for those whose criminal behaviour was directly related to their addiction, the amendments would divert resources from where they were most effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saddened, but not surprised, that the Minister believes that an alcohol education programme involving instruction and counselling about the abuse of alcohol is not appropriate or cost effective for inmates of Scottish prisons. However, given the current balance of the Committee, I shall not force the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>MEDICAL SERVICES IN PRISONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 256, in page 33, line 29, after "medical services", insert—
	<br><q><p>",including adequate psychiatric services."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 257, in page 34, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(4A) The Scottish Prison Service shall be required to ensure that there is individual access to clinical psychology services available to all prisoners.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We tabled amendment No. 256 on the advice of the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, which believes that there is an urgent need for psychiatric services to be available to prisoners, in view of the large number of mentally disordered prisoners. Apparently, the figure is one in three. If that is the case, I hope that the Minister acknowledges that medical services should include adequate psychiatric services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 257 also arises from anxieties that SACRO expressed. Individual access to clinical psychologists is being reduced. Prisoners are offered group work programmes, in which psychologists are involved. But those alone will not enable individual prisoners to obtain the required support to effect behavioural changes and to deal with their emotional and psychological needs. Until I read the briefing, I did not realise that individual access to psychologists was being reduced and that prisoners were offered group work programmes. While the latter could provide useful, I am surprised by the information, because, in some cases, work needs to be done on a one-to-one basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 256 is unnecessary. Psychiatric services are part of medical services, and fall within the definition of appropriate medical services in proposed new section 3A(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Psychiatric services to prisoners are provided by the national health service. That is an important feature of the existing arrangements. It enables treatment to continue after prisoners are liberated and thus ensures continuity of care. The Scottish Prison Service is also working to increase the proportion of nurses trained in mental illness on its staff. Its registered general nurses are encouraged to convert their existing qualification to registered mental nurse qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current services reflect modern practice within both hospital and community settings. They take the form of individual sessions and group work, as deemed appropriate by the responsible consultant. They relate to all aspects of psychiatric illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
The effect of amendment No. 257 would be to commit the Scottish Prison Service to a level of provision that would be largely cost-ineffective. Only a few prisoners require a specifically clinical input. The arrangements that the Scottish Prison Service is currently putting in place ensure that prisoners' needs will be met from a much wider range of psychological skills and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Prison Service is setting up an in-house psychological service, supplemented, as appropriate, by service level agreements with hospital trusts. The skills that will be available to it will be directed to identifying and tackling needs, designing programmes to reduce the likelihood of future offending, and also treating individuals' clinical needs when appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the arrangements that the Scottish Prison Service is putting in place will go further than the amendment and yet are more cost effective in that they target assessed needs directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is technically defective because the Scottish Prison Service is not a separate legal entity. I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I withdraw the amendment, can the Minister explain the purpose of new section 3A(1) if provision of medical services is currently satisfactory? The Minister spoke of further efforts being made, but can he give me a cast-iron guarantee that patients who need the services of clinical psychologists will not suffer under the new arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), the Minister said that provision of adequate psychiatric services was included in the term "appropriate medical services". Will he explain why people who need psychiatric services in prison are not subject to hospital direction orders and are not receiving psychiatric services in hospital rather than in prison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Maryhill I can say yes, the necessary services must be provided. Perhaps the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) would repeat his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak more slowly this time. Can the Minister explain why the prison service provides psychiatric services in prison? Surely any prisoner who requires such services should have been the subject of a hospital direction order and should receive psychiatric services in hospital before going to prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the prison would not satisfy the strict legal criteria for transfer. I made it quite clear that the services take the form of sessions or group work as deemed appropriate by the responsible consultant. Further to the point made by the hon. Member of Maryhill, there will certainly be greater flexibility in the arrangements for medical care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to be so suspicious, but is the move towards group work an attempt at cost cutting, or is it a genuine effort to provide something of benefit to prisoners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision depends on the medical condition of the person concerned. The decision in each case is taken by the responsible consultant, as is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have consultants been directed to do the job at less cost? Or has the matter been left purely to clinical judgment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Lady's point would be perfectly fair if there were any hidden agenda. There is not, and I am not aware of any such direction, which would be wrong. The mental condition of the person concerned is what matters, and that is determined by a consultant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the point, but I am concerned by the Minister's replies. Does he accept the SACRO figure given by hon. Friend the Member of Maryhill which suggests that one in three of the prison population are mentally disordered? If so, to what degree is that large proportion of the prison population mentally disordered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the strict legal criteria that are applied to hospital direction orders—that people must suffer from a mental illness or handicap of sufficient severity to require them to be admitted to hospital. What exactly does that mean? What sort of people do not get hospital direction orders, but end up in prison while suffering from a mental disorder? The Committee would like to know exactly what kind of people who suffer mental disorders are in prison? Some of us believe that they should not be in prison, but in hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a serious point. When I have visited prisons I have been made aware of people who are, for want of a better expression, inadequate. They may have a mental illness of such a character that hospitals do not want them—but whether a prisoner requires treatment in hospital is a clinical judgment. A prison governor once showed me a prisoner who kept relieving himself in public. No one wanted him; the hospital did not want him, nor did the prison. He ended up in prison for a few days. Obviously, we want people in such a condition to be treated with as much sensitivity and practical experience as possible. But whether or not a person requires treatment in hospital is essentially a matter for clinical judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now telling the Committee that clinical judgment will decide whether someone should be in hospital, but during an earlier reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill he said that strict legal criteria would apply. The Minister must be consistent in his arguments. Either strict legal criteria or clinical judgment will apply. Will the Minister tell the Committee which it will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is using semantics. It is a matter for clinical judgment whether a prisoner should receive treatment in hospital. The transfer must be carried out according
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
to the legal criteria—that is, the consultants must act within the framework of the law. I have no doubt that they will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's assurance that the provisions will not mean a worsening of treatment for patients who are mentally disordered, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>UNLAWFUL DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 36, line 23, after "prisoner", insert
	<br><q><p>"without that particular prisoner's consent".</p></q>
The amendment concerns the confidentiality of a prisoner's medical condition and public suppression of information which may be embarrassing to the prison authorities or the Secretary of State—in other words, whistle blowing. We remember the case of the medic at Barlinnie who referred in the press to alleged mistreatment of some prisoners. It seems that under the Bill, a medical practitioner would be prohibited from discussing publicly, even with the consent of the relevant prisoner or prisoners, information on the care and treatment of a prisoner while held in custody. That suppression of information will not be helpful and we would like the Minister to comment on the lack of transparency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The offence provision is necessary to ensure that doctors and others involved in providing medical services under the new type of contractual arrangements do not disclose information about prisoners except in the course of their duties or with the Secretary of State's authority. Exactly the same offence applies to prisoner custody officers employed at contracted-out prisons. It is important that there should be no unauthorised disclosure of information about prisoners. In cases where the disclosure is not authorised, we do not think that it should matter that a prisoner consents since the contractor's doctors and personnel should comply with the Secretary of State's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) that the amendment is unnecessary. Prisoners' interests are already protected by the clause and by the ethic of medical confidentiality by which medical practitioners are bound. A doctor could not in normal circumstances discuss a patient with another practitioner without the patient's permission. The clause does not affect the rules of medical confidentiality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to keep jumping to my feet, but the Minister did not listen to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton when he introduced the amendment. He made it clear that the Opposition are concerned with the situation in which a doctor in a prison is worried about injuries sustained by a prisoner, perhaps at the hands of warders, and wants to release that information, with the prisoner's consent, into the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
public domain. The clause would prevent anyone from doing so because the consent of the Secretary of State for Scotland would be required and that consent would be refused, as it has been refused in such circumstances in the past. That is why we want the prisoner to be able to ask his doctor to blow the whistle about the fact that the prisoner has received injuries at the hands of unknown people in the prison and that there should be an investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman is saying. If a prisoner alleges that he has been assaulted by a prison officer he should be able to call medical evidence on his behalf to sustain his complaint. I shall examine the points made by the hon. Members for Dumbarton and for Dundee, East and, if necessary, I shall come back at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address amendment No. 248 first, as it is the most substantive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 enables police officers to use reasonable force to take prints, impressions or samples from persons who have been arrested and are in custody, or who have been detained on the grounds that they are suspected of having committed, or are committing, an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 19 of the 1995 Act provides further powers for constables to take samples, prints or impressions from persons who have been convicted of an offence. Clause 43 of the Bill introduces new section 19A into the 1995 Act, which concerns the taking of samples from persons convicted of certain sexual offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As they stand currently, neither section 19 nor section 19A provides the express power for police officers to use reasonable force to take samples. Amendment No. 248 is accordingly required to enable police officers to use reasonable force in the same way as is provided for in section 18. Amendments Nos. 247 and 252 are consequential amendments. I should make it clear to the Committee that these amendments should not be taken as a change of policy. They will merely ensure, for the avoidance of doubt, that police officers have the express power to take all reasonable steps to obtain samples from relevant persons, where it is absolutely necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 265, in page 40, line 42, leave out from "certificate" to end of line 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 265 proposes to delete part of new subsection (2) of section 284 of the Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act 1995. The reason for the amendment is that we are seeking to allow a party affected by certificate evidence to challenge its sufficiency. Amendment No. 264 deals with a grammatical matter: we are for not only plain but proper English and, to clarify the grammar of the clause, we ask for "in that behalf' to be left out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A simple explanation of the need for the words that the hon. Gentleman seeks to delete is not possible. I hope that hon. Members will bear with me as I seek to explain why the words are useful and should be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will know, the presumption of sufficiency that is conferred by subsection (1) of section 284 of the 1995 Act does no more than remove the need for evidence to be led on those facts to which the presumption attaches even when there is no challenge to the facts of any dispute about them. The words which the hon. Gentleman seeks to delete are intended to do no more than state explicitly what is already implicit in this provision; that is, that while a party may challenge the facts contained in the certificate, such a challenge will not affect the presumption of sufficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the continuation of the presumption of sufficiency is that the party seeking to rely on the certificate, usually the prosecution, may choose not to lead additional evidence in support of the facts contained in the certificate and may choose, instead, to leave it to the court to decide, in the light of contradicting evidence which may be led by another party, which version of the facts should be accepted. New subsection (2A) provides that the presumption of sufficiency will not apply in any case in which the notification procedure prescribed by new subsection (2) is not followed. Where the certificate is being relied upon by the prosecution, it means that the interests of the defence are adequately protected. The amendment seeks to remove words which are, I think, helpful in clarifying the effect of the 1995 Act. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also consider amendment No. 267, in page 42, line 11, leave out "towards a child".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have previously discussed similar issues, but this amendment would add attempted rape and clandestine injury to the list of offences in respect of which samples may be taken from a convicted person. the list of relevant sexual offences includes rape, assault with intent to rape and various statutory offences. It is inconsistent to omit attempted rape and clandestine injury, and I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 267 would clarify the list of qualifying offences by adding the crimes of indecent assault and shameless indecency. It would also clarify the crime of lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour, which would be a qualifying offence, even if committed against an adult, and the subsidiary categories of sexual offence—namely, indecent assault and shameless indecency—which are included in the list of qualifying offences. That would promote consistency in the criminal law and I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has tabled two amendments that seek to amend the list of common law offences. First, the hon. Gentleman has sought to include the additional common law offences of attempted rape or clandestine injury to women in the list of offences to which clause 43 applies. In so far as attempted rape is concerned, I would draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to subparagraph (viii) of the definition of the relevant sexual offence at common law in the new section 19A (4). That includes provision for any attempt to commit any of the common law offences which are already included in that section. As the offence of rape is one of those listed, the section also, therefore, includes attempted rape. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not press that part of amendment No. 266.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue of clandestine injury to women in this context. Although that offence is charged relatively infrequently, it is of the sort that should fall within the range of offences that clause 43 defines as a relevant sexual offence. I am therefore prepared to accept in principle that part of amendment No. 266. I must add that there might be some technical legal difficulties, but I shall return with a revised definition on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 267 would remove the reference to a child in the definition of a common law offence of using lewd, indecent or libidinous behaviour or practices in clause 43. The reference was originally included because we wanted to make it absolutely clear that the clause referred to the common law offence of lewd and libidinous practices involving a child under the age of puberty and was not to be confused with the statutory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
offence of using lewd, indecent or libidinous practices or behaviour towards a girl of between 12 and 16. Such behaviour towards a girl over the age of puberty—which is 12 for girls—would be charged as the statutory offence. In respect of boys, whose legal age of puberty is 14, such behaviour may amount to indecent assault or shameless indecency. I recognise that the inclusion of a reference to a child might not strictly be necessary, but I am prepared to reconsider the drafting, and if it is considered necessary we shall table an amendment on Report. On that basis, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that a solicitor who practices on his own account—a sole solicitor—and who wishes to provide criminal legal assistance, requires to be registered both as an individual and as a firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisage that the code of practice to be drawn up by the Scottish Legal Aid Board will contain standards for the service provided by solicitors as individuals, and corporate standards, applying at the level of their firms. For example, standards relating to conduct and conduct of cases would be for the individual, while standards relating to matters such as organisation or accounting would be for the firm. That is why clause 44 requires both solicitors and firms to be registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, under the Bill as drafted, a sole solicitor who wishes to provide criminal legal assistance cannot be registered as a firm because he is not included in the definition of a firm. That means that the provisions in the code that are intended to apply to firms will not apply to a sole solicitor. That was not intended because it would put sole solicitors in a more favourable position than other solicitors.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the setting up by the Scottish Legal Aid Board of a criminal legal assistance register of solicitors and firms. They will have to apply to the board and satisfy it that they comply with a code of practice that it will publish with the approval of the Secretary of State. That is different from any separate code of conduct. The board will have to monitor compliance with the code of practice and it will be empowered to remove from the register solicitors or firms not complying with the code after giving them an opportunity to make representations and, if appropriate, time to remedy any defect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Under the Bill, solicitors employed by the board will not have to register and will not be required to comply with the code. It would be sensible for all solicitors to operate on the same basis.

Amendments Nos. 198 and 210, which are also in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and myself, would ensure that a transfer of agency may take place only when a client agrees to whom his other work may be transferred.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of your protection, Mrs. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that any system that employs the Scottish Legal Aid Board defence lawyers will allow clients freedom of choice of representation from both the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish Consumer Council. The right of choice of solicitor is an important right and a value worth protecting, as the Law Society of Scotland have pointed out to Opposition Members. The Government have sought to maintain that they are champions of consumer choice and it seems paradoxical that the Bill takes away consumer choice. Section 31 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 provides the following statutory framework:
	<br><q><p>"(1) Subject to section 30(2) of this Act, and to regulations made under subsection (9) below a person to whom legal aid or advice and assistance is made may select</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) a solicitor to advise or act for him and he shall be entitled to make the selection himself."</p></q>
Article 6(3) of the European convention on human rights states:
	<br><q><p>"Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights…to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance to be given it free when the interests of justice could be in breach of the European Convention".</p></q>
Accordingly, the provisions of the clause could contravene the United Kingdom's international obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Consumer Council intimates concern that the extent of the board's power does not take account of the views of the ultimate consumer of the service, the accused person. A further concern is that the the clause will inhibit, not facilitate, the proper evaluation of the pilot project. Clause 45 of the Bill states that
	<br><q><p>"the Board may…require as many of the persons seeking criminal legal assistance in that area as it considers appropriate to use the solicitors employed by it."</p></q>
The views of the users of the service provided would have to form a central part of such monitoring. If they are forced to use the system they are unlikely to have positive views about it, particularly if they have previously exercised their right to choose a particular solicitor. If the employed solicitors are to be fully effective they must be efficient and maintain high standards. While recognising that to be cost effective the public defender needs to be properly used, coercing clients is not the best method of achieving a fully utilised service. Consideration should be given to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
alternative pro-active approaches, such as advertising the service and its advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will comment on the service and its running costs. The Law Society has given us information about the Bill's proposal that the Scottish Legal Aid Board should employ six solicitors and 22 administrative staff. The Scottish Legal Aid Board currently employs eight solicitors at a cost of £300,000—an average of £37,500 per solicitor. The cost is stated to be salary, so may or may not include pension contributions and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agencies suggest that a litigation solicitor with four years' post-qualifying experience currently earns about £24,000. Let us assume that of those six solicitors, two earn about £37,500, two earn £30,000 and two £24,000. That totals £183,000. The Law Society calculates that if the 22 include administrative staff the cost across the board would be about £250,000. Civil Service pension arrangements require employers to contribute up to 7 per cent. of salary—assuming 5 per cent. across the board, the total is £21,650. With contracted out national insurance contributions, again assuming an average of 5 per cent., we have the same figure of £21,650.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training is difficult to quantify, but let us assume an average of 1 per cent. of the total wage bill—£5,000. A practising certificate would be £2,000. Temporary staff during the year would come, possibly, to £5,000. Recruitment costs would be £5,000. That gives total staff running costs of £493,000, almost half a million pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rental of premises in, say, central Edinburgh—they have obviously consulted chartered surveyors on this point—would be £35,000 for that size of staff, and when one adds rates, cleaning, heating and light, insurance and repairs, we are talking about £84,000. The associated technology adds a rather modest £10,000. Other equipment, telephones, vehicles costs and miscellaneous makes a total running cost of £612,300. There are also start-up costs for computerisation, furniture, library, telephone systems and alarm system which add up to £68,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes total staff costs of almost half a million pounds, total running costs of £612,000 and start-up costs of £68,000. The Law Society thinks it important that these proposals must be cost effective if they go ahead. They would not appear to be so given those figures. What is the Minister's view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton drifted to some extent into clause 45 on public defenders. I have some sympathy with him on that as that is logical, given the contents of clause 44. I also have some concerns about public defenders. I may be prepared to accept the pilot schemes that my right hon. Friend the Minister has in mind if they are strictly limited in numbers and time. We can address that later, but it has some relevance to clause 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton referred to client choice, which is very important. I have given the issue a lot of thought. When these probing amendments were tabled, I thought about client choice and had to acknowledge that those who have choice these days appear to be those who are on legal aid. A lot of people

cannot afford to take on lawyers. We should perhaps consider that at some future time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other matters also need to be considered. One of my constituents was—wrongly, I thought—charged with an offence on pretty flimsy evidence. It cost him a lot of money to provide a defence. When the case finally came to court, the charges were dismissed but he was left with a heavy bill. That was his penalty for proving himself innocent. Again, it may be worth while at some future time to reconsider the legal aid system and the means of individuals who have to pay a solicitor's fees for a criminal defence. Perhaps we should examine whether help should be given to people such as the lorry driver whom I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer total support to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for amendments Nos. 170 and 176. If we are to have a level playing field, any solicitor taken on board in the pilot scheme should fall in line with the code of practice just as other solicitors would. I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to look sympathetically on those amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been important and I shall seek to do justice to the comments made by my hon. Friends and to the representations made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This large group of amendments centres on three issues. They are, first, whether there are to be any directly employed solicitors at all; secondly, whether such solicitors are to be included in the criminal legal assistance register, and thirdly whether the Scottish Legal Aid Board can allocate clients to those solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be necessary to debate all those matters at length, in view of the amendments that, in response to representations, the Government propose to bring forward in relation to clause 45 as a whole. The amendments reflect concerns about clause 45 which, it is assumed, will stay in the Bill as it stands. The amendments that we now propose to present on Report will, however, ensure that the scheme is clearly seen as a pilot that is limited in scope and in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) favours a public defender scheme. In his article in the Scottish Legal Action Group journal of June or July this year, he suggested that the concept is worth exploring. We suggest a pilot scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to discuss the proposals in detail should we debate clause 45 stand part, but I think that it is more appropriate to explain the details now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to note that my speeches have wide currency. A public defender system is worth exploring, through a pilot system. I welcome the Minister on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to assure the Committee that that will be arranged. It will require substantial amendments, which I should like to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concerns of hon. Members stem from the fact that although the Government's intention was only to pilot the direct employment of solicitors, clause 45 is not confined to a pilot project. We therefore agree that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
there is a case for amendments to bring the drafting of clause 45 more clearly into line with the policy intention that my hon. Friend, the Member for Eastwood highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to amend the clause in three respects. First, we propose to restrict the number of solicitors who could be employed by the board to a maximum of six as in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill. Secondly, we propose to require the Secretary of State to present to Parliament a report of a review of the pilot within three years of the clause being brought into force. Thirdly, we propose to provide that clause 45 should lapse five years after it is brought into force, subject to any transitional provisions to cover cases then being dealt with by the relevant solicitors. The effect is that clause 45 would lapse after five years unless the powers were renewed by Parliament through further primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will greatly reduce the scope for anxiety about clause 45, which will be seen clearly as facilitating limited pilot projects, as was always our intention. I hope that that will allay the fears of hon. Members and of the Law Society and lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 198, 209 and 210 and 218 centre on the very existence of directly employed solicitors and would remove from the Bill any reference to transferring work to them, in the event that another solicitor was prevented from continuing with cases under other provisions in the Bill. The amendments will not be necessary if hon. Members agree that clause 45 can continue to stand part of the Bill in the light of our proposed amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 170 and 176. which were tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Eastwood and for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), would require solicitors directly employed by the board to be included in the criminal legal assistance register. We are prepared to accept them in principle. It would, of course, be necessary to ensure that there was no requirement for the board to register as a firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 236, 299, and 302 to 306 all bear on the power of the board to allocate clients to directly employed solicitors. There is no reason why accused persons whose defence is being met from public funds should have an unfettered choice of representative. That does not conflict with case law from the European Court of Human Rights. We see nothing wrong with the principle of allocation. While the Scottish Legal Aid Board will, of course, consider the extent to which the pilot project can be set up without using the power of allocation, it may be necessary to use it, at least in the short term, to ensure that public defenders have an adequate case load to give a valid comparison with other forms of provision. The evaluation will examine the effects of allocation on the results. The reaction of accused persons will be considered among other factors. Therefore, I ask the Opposition not to press the amendment to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken at length on the large group of amendments. Hon. Members may wish to make other points. However, I make a commitment to introduce the amendments that are necessary to cover the points that were made by my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Dumbarton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your guidance, Mrs. Winterton. I have some questions about the code of practice that clause 44 mentions. No amendment seems to relate to that. Therefore, should I ask my questions during the stand part debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady should ask the questions later, when we consider the relevant amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on amendment No. 173.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like clarification from the Minister on two major points. First, why does he think that a pilot scheme is necessary? What is so wrong with the existing system that it leads the Minister to believe that an experiment is needed? I assume that the experiment has been set up to improve the system and to provide information, which would enable comparisons to be made. The new direction in which the Government propose to move was, presumably, stimulated by anxieties. It would be helpful if the Minister took the Committee into his confidence and explained what he perceived to be wrong with the current legal provision in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, why has the Minister felt it necessary to beat such a humiliating retreat in the face of substantial objections from vested interests? I cannot think of another recent example of the Government being so quick to beat a retreat from a policy that aroused strong opposition from vested interests. Have they made a complete U-turn because so many lawyers live in marginal constituencies? They have moved from presenting clear proposals to an announcement, which the Minister made without a blush, that they are somersaulting, thereby reducing the number of solicitors to only six, and limiting the time which will lapse after five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the experiment explore? How will it be measured? What are the criteria? How will its success be judged? Without clear performance criteria, against which results can be measured, what is the point of embarking on such a limited experiment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Minister think that such a small experiment will provide valid results? I understand how an experiment in a rural area, combined with an experiment in a city and another in a small town, might yield examples of practice in different areas that would allow reasonable judgments to be made. But the Government propose a single pilot, presumably based in one geographical area. Surely the results will not be as valid as they would be in an extended experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm whether that is the Government's intention? Having been forced to back down from a full-blooded introduction of a service provided by the public sector, the Minister tries to destroy the validity of the experiment simply in order to lapse back into the status quo ante. But if that is the case, will the Minister answer my original question: why did he believe that an experiment was necessary? What is wrong with the current system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from climbing down, the Minister has taken a positive step forward. The amendments to clause 44 are so substantial—they will also have a major effect on clause 45—that perhaps the Minister should withdraw the two clauses and table two new clauses on Report. Otherwise, we shall debate a whole host of amendments that will fall on account of the Minister's important statement. I shall listen to his advice, but a simpler way forward would be to clarify the situation by tabling new clauses 44 and 45 and debating them on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my right hon. friend the Minister. He said that he accepted amendments Nos. 170 and 176 in principle. I am happy to withdraw them if that is what he is suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to my right hon. friend for his comments on the Government's general intention on the proposal concerning the public defender. It is highly controversial, as hon. Members know from the representations from the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, the Law Society of Scotland, the Glasgow Bar Association and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) said about my right hon. Friend beating a retreat. Unless I have misunderstood, he is putting into the Bill what the Government proposed initially, as set out by the Secretary of State on Second Reading and by my right hon. Friend. That is a sensible way forward. Despite the reservations about the public defender system, it is difficult to argue against a pilot scheme, which is what my right hon. Friend is proposing. If such a scheme were to be extended, the Government of the day would have to introduce primary legislation, when the House would have an opportunity for further and full debate. That is good for parliamentary democracy and I congratulate my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister sums up, perhaps he will refer to the financial aspects. The explanatory and financial memorandum states that the cost of the public defender system will be about £300,000, but the figures that I have are widely at variance with that. Does the Minister accept that that £330,000 is inadequate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the public defender system and the pilot project are worth considering. The reason for a pilot project is to examine the Scottish situation and not simply to import a scheme from other jurisdictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the cost of legal aid and other hon. Members have expressed their concern. Criminal legal aid almost trebled between 1987–88, when the cost was £25.8 million, and 1995–96, when the cost was £74.4 million, so there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 17 April this year I received an answer to a parliamentary question concerning the 20 solicitors' companies in rank order which had received the most money from the Scottish Legal Aid Board with the amount paid to them in each of the past five years. For years and years that information was confidential, but we pressed the issue and the information was eventually
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
released. It is right that it should be released. In 1994–95 the top earner was Ross Harper and Murphy with more than £3.316 million and at 10th place was Grady and Co. with more than £1.084 million. The highest earning top companies in 1994–95 accounted for more than £20 million of legal aid. In 1995–96, Ross Harper and Murphy was still at No.1 with more than £3.342 million and at 10th place was Robert Kerr with more than £ 1.036 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To date, there has been an inadequate exploration of exactly how the money has been expended. I welcome the public defender system in that that pilot project will provide a benchmark against costs. I am sure that Conservative Members—I nearly called them by hon. Friends—would concur with those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister's assurance that the pilot project is a proper pilot project and that, therefore, he will give thought to the criteria to be established. We may not be able to hear his assurance tonight because he has given substantial concessions to date. However, on Report I hope that we will have those assurances in terms of the benchmark costs and also in terms of access to justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill has spoken about battered women, including those who suffer domestic violence. Many of them are given inadequate justice and it is important that we examine why. Where we suffer most is with the civil legal aid side. Civil legal aid takes up less than 30 per cent. of the total budget and most of that is for matrimonial work. That would give the untrue impression that there are no other civil disputes in Scottish society. We must examine how Scottish civil legal aid works and try to widen access to it. Will the Minister focus on those two issues and give us more detail on Report of the criteria for the pilot project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend the Minister replies, I ask him to consider a fact that is relevant to what the hon. Member for Dumbarton has been saying about costs—the taxpayer meets all these costs. There is no one else. We have to do something about how much is spent on maintaining prisons, on the police services and on legal aid. My right hon. Friend should recognise that Conservative Members welcome his positive approval to addressing that real problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to identify myself with the comments that my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside made on costing. He has more than answered the questions asked by the hon. Member for Govan. The hon. Member for Dumbarton may have been right if he had referred to Conservative members of the Committee as hon. Friends, given the comments made by the hon. Member for Govan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A thought strikes me on the issue of costs and the levels of remuneration for solicitors' companies. To what extent were the number of cases covered by those companies included? Does my right hon. Friend have any idea about the number of cases that would be liable to be undertaken by public defenders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
What we are examining is market testing in reverse. We have heard much about market testing in the public sector, but here we have an element of market testing in the private sector, which shows how flexible the Government can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask some questions about costs. We want to explore a number of issues. Could a solicitor charge less but give an inadequate service by employing someone who was not legally qualified to carry out part of the work? That work may include advising someone in a police cell who is facing serious charges. Costs could be reduced in a way that provides the client with a less adequate service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want to ensure that the service is provided without costs escalating above what is reasonable. If any of us were facing a murder charge, however, we would want a professionally qualified person to carry out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a public defender system could run at a cheaper cost and, therefore, could be of benefit to people on low incomes, such as women on income support, I should be anxious that such a system might be run on the cheap. What resources would be allocated to such a system? If it were run in such a way as to cut costs as much as possible, justice would not be served.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. I can confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood that amendments Nos. 170 and 176 have been accepted in principle and that we are definitely proposing a pilot scheme, subject to assessment and evaluation in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked why we should have a public defender system at all. First, public defenders were recommended in 1980 by the royal commission on legal services and, in 1987, by Justice. There is favourable evidence from other jurisdictions to show that such systems work, and we want to see whether the public defender model has a place in Scotland. That is why we are suggesting a pilot scheme—a project that the hon. Member for Dumbarton also suggested in the Scottish Legal Action Group journal. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be one pilot scheme or several. The restriction to six solicitors would allow one or two pilot projects, as announced in our White Paper, "Crime and Punishment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may be interested to know that public defender schemes have worked in Canada and even in the United States, although with considerable variation. The Spangenberg report on Nebraska indicated that, in almost all states covered, the public defender was less expensive than private practitioners. In Canada, the most expensive provinces were those that had most involvement of the private Bar, while the least expensive provinces had least involvement of the private Bar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of quality, I cannot accept that a salaried service would provide low quality service. Research in Canada shows that the same proportion of clients were convicted, whether privately or publicly defended. The savings on cost and time are not achieved at the expense of quality of service and, in at least one respect—rates of imprisonment—the outcome for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
clients of the public defender was better. Some of the evidence suggested that that was because public defenders negotiated more effectively over pleas and sentences. There has been considerable research but we believe that we need more evidence from the pilot project before reaching a final conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton asked about the cost to the taxpayer of setting up the public defender system. In a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, who asked about the cost of implementing part V of the Bill, I said that it is anticipated that the annual non-wage cost of employing directly employed solicitors would be £260,000. The estimated average salary of the additional staff is £17,500, representing six legally qualified and 14 non-qualified staff salaries. Annual non-wage costs for private investigation and registration measures is expected to be £43,000. It is anticipated that the average salary costs of the extra staff will be £26,500 for eight staff at various grades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked why we were changing the Bill. We received a substantial number of representations and believe that it is appropriate to listen to those representations and to act on them. As presently drafted, the clause goes wider than our policy. My right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) asked whether it would be appropriate to withdraw the whole clause and draft a new one. We believe and have been advised that it would be better to amend the clause. The criteria for which the amended clause will provide will be cost-effectiveness, quality of services, efficiency of the criminal justice system and client satisfaction, all of which are in the public interest. Therefore, I commend to my hon. Friends the points that have been raised and want to make it clear that we will act on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's hon. Friends may not need to question that but I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, in one public defender system, there had been more acquittals than in the past. I am not sure which country he was talking about. It would be useful for the Committee, even at this late stage, to see more evidence on that. Client satisfaction is part of the whole equation. We should not just ensure that costs do not spiral beyond what is reasonable, but that the client receives an appropriate service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was research from Canada.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where can I read the details of that? I should be interested to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will it be possible for solicitors to join together in a co-operative enterprise to take part in the pilot scheme? Large firms will have an enormous advantage over small firms, which may be unable to provide the service on their own. However, they could link up with other small firms to provide it. Is such co-operation possible under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a complex debate. It started by dealing with the proposed register. I seem to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
be causing concern to the officials. Have I come in at the wrong point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. We are awaiting your words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We started the debate by discussing the register for those involved in criminal legal aid work and the need for the Scottish Legal Aid Board to be responsible for drawing up a register and the code of conduct that will apply to those who are on it. The Minister then linked that proposal to clause 45 and the public defender system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to question the Minister on what he said about the public defender system. My hon. Friend the Member for Govan asked about the need for such a system and asked why a pilot scheme was required. In response, the Minister referred to two reports, one of which was published in 1980. If a public defender system was such a good idea in 1980, why has it taken 17 years for the Minister to introduce a pilot project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Eastwood. I do not know whether he was a Minister in 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even me. Strictly speaking in 1980, the Hughes commission recommended an experiment but it did not go any farther than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An experiment was recommended 17 years ago, yet the Minister introduces one at the last minute as though he has just had a great idea. The Minister should explain why the Government have sat for 17 years without acting on that recommendation. When they drafted the Bill, they did not even mention a pilot scheme for a public defender system, but spoke about instituting the system throughout Scotland. Government amendments for a pilot scheme have been introduced at the last minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsatisfactory for the Government to introduce legislation and then to quote a report published in 1980 as the basis for action in 1997. It is bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another recommendation for a pilot scheme was made in 1987. The Government have been sitting on that recommendation for 10 years, and they still have not acted. I am worried. Pilot schemes for the public defender system have been proposed, but in terms that are extremely limited. Such a public defender system is not meant to last: it will involve only six solicitors in the whole of Scotland. A report to Parliament will be made after the first three years, but the clause will fall after five years. That takes us back to the position before the amendments were tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. enemy. The Government had plenty on their hands in the 1980s.

on its feet. The public defender system contains an element of nationalisation, so 1980 would have been the wrong time to consider that. The Government achieved massive successes through privatisation, so they can now afford to be a bit pragmatic and consider the recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, that was a bizarre intervention by the hon. Member for Ayr. Only a few moments ago, the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) told the Committee that he was worried about the spiralling costs of crime and the spiralling costs of the police and legal aid since 1980. Who have been responsible for that? The very Government whom the hon. Member for Ayr said had a lot on their hands in 1980. They were setting about creating the situation in which we are paying £15,000 million a year for crime. The hon. Member for Ayr has the nerve to lecture us about the Government's performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in full flow and is, I am sure, enjoying himself. He is always accusing Conservatives of being doctrinaire, dogmatic and inflexible. Surely he must be generous enough to recognise that we see flaws in the present system that have to be addressed. We are not taking a doctrinaire approach. Cannot the hon. Gentleman be generous enough to say that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are taking a doctrinaire approach. Their approach to the whole problem is to say that costs are spiralling because lawyers and accused people are on the fiddle and the legal aid system is being abused. The Government attack that instead of looking at the real causes of spiralling crime such as the appalling social and economic conditions that the Government have created for a vast proportion of the population. It is the Government who have been doctrinaire, not me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to get on to another point before that intervention. Clauses 44 and 45 are linked to clauses 46 and 47, which bring in fixed fees for criminal legal aid work. They also talk about contracting out criminal legal aid work. The purpose of the pilot project that the Minister referred to has nothing to do with whether we want a public defender system. They are setting it up to find out the real cost of legal aid work and to set up a competitive tendering system for criminal legal aid work. That worries me. What I have seen of compulsory competitive tendering wherever it has been applied—for example, in local authorities and the health service—shows that it has led to declining standards, poorer quality service, and the arrival of cheapskates who are not properly qualified and cannot do a proper job. The people who lose out are those who depend on services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being less than fair to the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) who came up with perfectly logical amendments which were accepted by my right hon. Friend. My right hon. Friend seeks quality amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even this Minister is prepared to repair complete, absolute and utter blunders, if they have been made by someone else. There is no substantial public division on that matter, just an omission in drafting which a colleague was sharp enough to spot so that the Minister had to take it on board. That is not quite the same as being prepare to listen to the tide of public opinion. The explanation for the Minister's change of mind has more to do with the Government's majority, as we saw on Scottish local government matters when one or two maverick Members—the same ones are here—were able to force substantial change for vested interests. The Government were not convinced of the logic of the system, but had a vested interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify why he thinks that a change is necessary in the system? He mentioned cost and quality and the efficiency of the criminal justice system. It would help to us and others if the Minister would clarify his concerns on cost, quality and efficiency. A substantial number of anecdotal reports are floating around, and they show that hon. Members should have substantial concerns of all those points. Lawyers may take on more cases than they can handle, milk the system and be inadequately prepared. The Minister is aware that many people believe that cases are pursued through stages that are not strictly necessary legally in order to maximise the income of the solicitor involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent lunch today with representatives of the Scottish legal fraternity, who told me of other horror stories that must circulate more widely than around the table at which I was sitting. If, like me, the Minister is aware of anxieties, he owes it to us to spell them out and to make it clear that the Government share people's anxiety about the legal system in Scotland and intend to pursue more vigorously changes that will improve the system, even if that means standing up to powerful vested interests. The Government have often rightly—and often wrongly—interfered to take on vested interests, yet they are unwilling to do so in these circumstances. It is important that they clarify the issue for us.

Why is the experiment designed to last for only three years, when the legislation will lapse after five years? Is there any significance in those figures? I can understand an experiment running for a fixed period, than the legislation lapsing, but why three years and five years? I do not have a legal background; I am not aware of the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
significance of either of those figures. It would be helpful if the Government gave us an explanation as there are other aspects of activity on which they seem hell-bent if I may use that term—setting land mines by letting contracts or making appointments for periods that are much longer, presumably designed to hamstring an incoming Labour Goverment. I look forward to the Minister's answers to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked the same question that he asked earlier: why have public defenders? The answer is because of the evidence from other jurisdictions. A table giving the cost of a criminal case in America shows that in 1992–93, in no fewer than seven American states, the cost per criminal case under the public defender was $543, but $750 in private practice. Private practice is overall a more expensive system. The hon. Member for Dumbarton made a relevant point when he said that the cost for legal aid had escalated enormously. Another consideration is the point made by Justice. In 1987, it argued that
	<br><q><p>"a more uniformly efficient service is achieved because of greater supervision and accountability than is possible with private practitioners. Backup services are better … Generally it is easier to obtain whatever is needed for the proper defence of the accused … and a higher quality of service can be assured."</p></q>
We want to ascertain whether that is appropriate in a Scottish context and the best way of finding out it not to leap to conclusions, but to have a pilot scheme, which was always are intention, and assess the situation properly. If it works successfully we will take the policy forward. If it does not work, we would not proceed. We would have the evidence and not pre-judge the issue, which I believe will satisfy those who sent in representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Maryhill that it is not more acquittals, but a lower rate of imprisonment, that is regarded as a success by those concerned. The hon. Lady asked whether solicitors could form a cooperative; the answer is not really, as the solicitors are to be employed by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. There is nothing to prevent private practitioners from cooperating if they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of the solicitors employed by the Scottish Legal Aid Board, does the Minister envisage a pilot scheme whereby the solicitors would work for law centres or citizens advice bureaux with the Scottish Legal Aid Board having overall guidance and control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The solicitors will come under the Scottish Legal Aid Board. They might co-operate with other bodies. However, pilot schemes will need to be worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill suggests that the pilot schemes will be controlled by statutory instruments. However, representations made it clear that that did not sufficiently reassure those who were directly involved and the Law Society. Therefore, it is right to allow Parliament to control the extension of the pilot scheme. Thus there has been no U-turn in policy, simply a clarification of our resolve to establish an appropriate pilot scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to press the Minister further. He claimed that the public defender system in other countries worked out at a lower cost per client. That is only one aspect of the matter. The Minister also said that it resulted in a lower rate of imprisonment. Does that mean more acquittals and non-custodial sentences? A lower rate of imprisonment must mean that more clients were not sent to prison, but received some other sentence of were acquitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant a shorter period of imprisonment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee had followed the Opposition's suggestion and set up a Special Standing Committee, we could have heard advice from the Law Society, the Glasgow Bar Association and other bodies that have experience of the matters that we are discussing. We would not have got into a fankle. I find it difficult to deal with issues of which I have no experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask about costs. In Glasgow, trials currently cost less because they take less time. A system already exists to ensure that trials do not drag on for weeks and months and thus increase cost. Will the Minister take that into account in the pilot scheme? It must relate to a system that prevents unjustifiable delays, which were a substantial part of escalating costs in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister complained that I raised the same points again. I did that because he did not answer them. I have given him two chances, and still he has not answered the specific question about five years and three years. Can the Minister clarify why five years and three years are considered appropriate periods for the experiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the American example, which showed that private practice was more expensive than the public defender scheme. But that only causes anxiety if the Minister believes that the cost of private practice in this country is too high. If the Minister believed that private practice costs were adequate, there would be no need for an experiment. Is the Minister worried about the cost of the existing system per case? I understand the point about the overall number of cases affecting the overall cost. I am interested in the cost per case, irrespective of the procedural changes that are already being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that accountability would be improved by a process that I did not entirely understand when he explained it so quickly. Does the Minister believe that quality and accountability in the existing system could be questioned? Is the pilot designed to produce evidence about that? What are the issues of accountability and quality? Other ways of tackling those issues could proceed parallel with the experiment of a public defender pilot. It would be helpful if the Minister, who has access to more information than Opposition Members, felt free to draw those matters to our attention. If the Minister is in experimental mode he might want, on Report, to table another group of amendments, to pilot an expansion of law centres' power to work on criminal cases. If the Government are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
interested in pilots—something that I generally welcome—it would be worth running several different types of pilot in parallel, so that not only could one pilot be compared with existing provision, but pilots could be compared with each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not respond to another query that I raised previously, about why it is not considered appropriate to run different pilots or experiments in different geographical areas, so that different types of evidence is produced. I find it difficult to see how a group of six could operate over a city, a small town and a rural area. However, if the Minister intends that to happen, I should welcome his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few points in response to the Minister's remarks about other countries' experience of public defender systems—in America in particular. The Minister argued that experience in America showed that public defender systems were cheaper to the public purse than a system in which private lawyers represent people who are accused of crimes. However, that assertion does not mean anything, unless the Minister can show that the public defender system is America provides the same quality of service to defendants as to private lawyers. The difference may simply reflect the fact that a poorer service can be provided for less money. Perhaps the Committee's only priority is to reduce the cost of legal aid, in which case it does not matter whether people are found guilty or not, as long as the legal aid system becomes cheaper and lawyers can be paid less than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the right hon. Gentleman says, "Don't be stupid", but the argument has so far been dominated by the question of cost to the public purse of defending people against charges. I have not yet heard one argument about quality from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear that, but I did hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend, like me, worried about the lack of access to justice for many people in Scotland, particularly with respect to civil legal aid, which many lawyers find too unprofitable to take on? As a result of that there is an unmet need, about which something should be done. Does my hon. Friend agree that access and quality go hand in hand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very much so. Civil legal aid is, of course, different from the criminal legal aid that we are discussing. I am not aware that the Government have evidence of abuse of criminal legal aid or of money being wasted under the present system. I understand that the rates paid to solicitors who take on criminal legal aid work have not been increased since 1992.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
Individual solicitors and firms who deal with criminal legal aid cases have been receiving smaller and smaller rewards for the work that they do. The Minister may have other evidence, but if so, he should present it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the line that the hon. Gentleman is pursuing. Would he and the hon. Member for Dumbarton want legal aid to be extended to embrace many more people, perhaps by raising current means test thresholds? If so, how much would that cost, and could the Government afford it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously electioneering. It does not matter what I say. I am not a Front Bench spokesperson any longer, so anything that I say could easily be denied by New Labour. Therefore, hon. Members should not push me on the subject. I would just be called mad. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton says from a sedentary position that he would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to make a serious point about the public defender system. The Minister has been giving the Committee the impression that that might be a good way forward in dealing with criminal legal aid cases. The Minister used the American example. I merely draw attention to the fact that citing the American example proves nothing. The fact that it is cheaper does not make it a better system; it may be much worse. Indeed, he intimated as much in his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill when he said that much shorter periods of detention were secured under this type of system. That may be because public defenders are not well prepared when they go to court or are unable to argue their case, so they resort to plea bargaining much earlier. They do not go to trial and thereby keep costs down because they are unprepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As evidence I can point to what is happening to the procurator fiscal service. Dundee sheriffs have complained to me that lawyers from that service come to court and are handed a brief two minutes before going in. They have no idea of the circumstances of a case. They cannot argue it in court so are forced to go to plea bargaining at an early stage, and criminals get away with a much lighter sentence than they might have done. That is because the procurator fiscal service is publicly funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I favour public ownership. I like the idea of raising taxes to spend on quality public services; but we live under a Tory Government which is a guarantee that public services will be underfunded. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister responsible for local government funding says "Humph" from a sedentary position. He knows that he has spent the past few years of office undercutting public services in local government. If a public defender service did become established in Scotland, the Tory Government would never give it sufficient money to ensure that it provided a quality service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spoken about the American experience without having the facts before us. It is well known that under the American system an unknown number of prisoners are on Death Row for years, awaiting decisions about whether they will be sent to the electric chair. The cost of American lawyers arguing

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
for and against a person being sentenced to capital punishment is huge. Many who are found guilty of murder are poor and uneducated and will receive a service that is probably extremely inadequate. Many American states do not believe in high quality public services paid for by taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The hon. Member for Ayr favours the introduction of capital punishment in this country. No doubt he would ally it to a public defender's system so that those who faced the rope in Britain would not get quality representation in court. They would have to take whichever junior lawyer was available under a public defender system that was underfunded by a Government favoured by the hon. Gentleman. His constituents might be left in that unpleasant position. No doubt they will be interested to read that he does not represent their interests in Parliament, but instead represents the interests of the public purse that is spent in the south of England where everyone worries about high taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk about the American system. So far as I am aware, the Minister has never been to America, at least not to practice law. He does not know much about the public defender system, although he mentions it here in his defence. We have received a briefing about the American system from a number of vested interests—that is how they have been described. It refers to a speech made in September by Mr. Robert Spangenberg, the chairman of the American Bar Association's ad hoc committee on indigent defence systems. He knows something about the American public defender system. He states that:
	<br><q><p>"the system leads to few trials, very little preparation and in general there is a concern about the quality of representation provided. There is very little client contact, and the whole system is overburdened and underfunded."</p></q>
If that is what the Minister wants, he will find that no one supports him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with me in principle about the public defender system and the need for a pilot scheme? Does he also agree on the absolute necessity of a properly resourced system so that we can examine the case further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My whole argument is about a public defender system. Under a Tory Government it would be guaranteed to fail and to be underfunded. That would not happen under a Labour Government. I am in favour of any measure that brings anything into public ownership. I am surprised that the hon. Members for Ayr and for Eastwood are in favour of nationalisation. That would go down very badly in their constituencies. I am definitely in favour of nationalisation if it is properly resourced and leads to high quality. If that kind of pilot project were being offered, we would have no problem. However, we know that that is not the case. The Government want to cut costs, reduce the quality of service and let the poor who come before the courts face the tune because the Government are not prepared properly to provide quality defence in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Is it appropriate for me at this stage to speak to amendments to clause 45 despite the fact that they appear to be included in a group of amendments to clause 44?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to your question is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments to clause 45 in my name are amendments Nos. 301 to 307, which have been included in the group led by amendment No. 170, which amends clause 44. I appreciate that there is a difficulty. I only realised about 20 minutes ago that the selection list has them all mixed up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is confusion because of the selection. You may speak to your amendments now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a narrow point first about amendment No. 307 before making a couple of other points in connection with the group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 307 relates to a relatively frequent occurrence in private firms, where a number of accused on the same set of charges turn up at the same group of solicitors to seek representation. The standard way of dealing with them is for the firm to retain one of the accused and direct the others elsewhere so that there can be no conflict of interest. The accused persons may not always have precisely the same interests but to avoid conflict private firms farm out multiple accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot scheme that is being proposed by the Government would not include that provision. A group of solicitors in the same office might end up representing different individuals with conflicting interests. The amendment's aim is to tease out how exactly the Government would envisage that working, given that that conflict of interest is recognised forcefully in the private sector but does not seem to be recognised in the public sector set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to press the Minister a little on some of his examples, particularly his reference to the Canadian experience which, I assume, concerns the situation in Manitoba. When a public defender system was introduced there the legal aid rate to private solicitors was quickly reduced by 35 per cent. As a direct result, many private firms stopped carrying out criminal legal aid work. That had the knock-on effect of increasing the number of people who ended up in the public defender system. Will the Minister comment on that information, which gives rise to the concern that an enormous drop in legal aid rates is likely to follow the introduction of the system? I am particularly interested in hearing the Government's comments, especially in view of the American experience. In the United States the amount of money spent in one year on the prosecution service outstripped the amount spent on the public defender service by some three times. The costs and resources were huge and that gives rise to concern about the broader picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Canadian experience suggests that if we go down that road, choice will be removed from individuals. That choice is very important and I hope that the Minister will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
I hope that the Minister will also comment on Government statements in a consultation paper in 1993 that they did not favour the introduction of a public defender scheme because they did not believe that it would justify the earmarking of the significant amounts of legal aid funding that would be necessary. The take-up of the present duty solicitor's scheme showed that when people have a choice, by and large they want to stay with the solicitor they know rather than being directed to someone else, even a duty solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to what the hon. Member for Govan said earlier. What has happened in the period from 1993 to the present to have changed the Government's mind? During a period of rising crime, it is axiomatic that the cost of criminal legal aid will rise. If the crime rate falls, the cost of legal aid will also fall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a helpful debate and I hope to answer all the questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about evidence from Manitoba. I have not seen the exact details to which she referred but I have seen evidence from a study that revealed that the average cost of a criminal case in Manitoba was $197 when a salaried lawyer was used and $307 when the private bar was used. Even when cases were broken down by criminal case type, costs per case were still higher with the private bar. Representations were made by the Bar Association which said that the evaluation did not recognise sufficiently that clients represented by private lawyers might be more demanding than those who use salaried lawyers. None the less, the facts were compelling and that was recognised. The issue of costs is a factor, which was made clear in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a point. I thought he said that the costs per case for the public defender were higher. Was that a slip of the tongue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I think the hon. Gentleman misheard. The cost for the public defender on average in America was considerably lower than for private lawyers. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) may also have misunderstood me. The public defender's success rate in shorter criminal sentences for clients was revealed in one study. The evidence is variable and we must recognise that. Contrary to what has been suggested, I have been in an American court—the Supreme Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was the Minister the accused?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I was not the accused and I was not a witness, but the public defenders were impressive. However, the evidence is variable and that is why it is right to have a pilot scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell the Committee whether he will consider the pilot project as a benchmark for costs? I referred to Ross Harper and Murphy receiving £3.3 million in 1995–96. I understand that that organisation had 63 practising certificates, which works out at approximately £60,000 a time. The need for more investigation vis-á-vis public versus
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
private is very important. Will that be included in the pilot project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the pilot project is to produce the necessary information. Perhaps I should mention to the Committee that, more than 20 years ago, I was employed by Ross Harper and Murphy. The right hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was also very active there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is still there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he is still there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about quality, which is why we are legislating to introduce a code of practice. The evidence from America is valuable. In some states, public defenders are overloaded but the evidence from jurisdictions where the public defender system is fairly loaded shows that the results for the client are no worse and the cost comparison is favourable. I shall not go into what the White Paper says because hon. Members will be familiar with it, but I want to reply to the hon. Member for Govan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals will provide for one or two locations and will allow the public defender system to handle a wide range of cases. I am sure that will provide the information we need to evaluate the pilot project. A term of three years is the minimum possible to enable us to evaluate the cost and benefits of public defenders. It takes nine to 12 months for a criminal case to be completed, and the remaining two years will allow time to introduce further legislation to continue the scheme or to wind it up in an orderly way. That is the reason for the time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the pilot projects, I have already referred to the criteria. Will the Minister give us an assurance that the pilot project will be monitored by independent researchers? Secondly, will the Scottish Legal Aid Board's administration of the pilot project be made public? That is important, especially in the light of my previous question about consumer choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give those undertakings and there is one other point that I failed to mention earlier. The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross raised the issue of conflict of interest. I am glad to reassure her that new section 28A(5) includes a provision to prevent any conflict of interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not given any reassurance about the cost of the project. If the project is inappropriately funded, it will not provide worthwhile evidence about the scheme. It will also be hard lines on the people who are represented in criminal trials during the process, who may well receive an inferior service and suffer as a consequence. The issue of resources is crucial and the Minister must reassure us that the resources will be sufficient to ensure that the scheme has every chance of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am concerned that if, in the pilot project, a group of public defenders works within the same organisation as prosecuting lawyers, the defenders will concentrate their efforts on cutting costs, rather than on providing a high quality service, in order to impress

their masters with how cheaply they can operate. How will that problem be addressed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will not be surprised to learn that I am predisposed to favour the public over the private sector, but only if it acts in a way that serves public interests and is not used as some sort of cheapjack substitute that does not satisfy justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question; the answer is contained in the written answer to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was responsible for these matters in 1993 when the Government issued a consultation paper about criminal legal aid. In that consultation paper, they concluded that a public defender system may provide some cost savings but that it would seem to put at risk the independence from the Crown of those representing the accused. What has made the Minister change his mind in the past few years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the evidence will come from the pilot; if it is not working, we will not extend it. If it is working satisfactorily, the Government will probably take that evidence into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say why he is not seeking powers to enable him to conduct a series of different experiments, other than the public defender system? Why are the proposals that he will introduce on Report so restrictive and why do they apply only to that single method of experiment? It has been the Government's plan to seek wider, more enabling powers in order to pick and choose how to progress. That approach is understandable, but I want to know why, in this case, the Minister chooses to fetter himself so tightly? I suggest that it is because he is not master in his own house; the narrowness of the Government's majority has forced that upon him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Irrespective of the words of the hon. Members for Govan and for Dundee, East, who seem to think that there was a move to promote the vested interests of the Law Society of Scotland, I thank the Law Society openly for the support that it has given to the Bill, which every member of the Committee has taken willingly, and which has been aimed at providing better legislation. The amendments establish and recognise the fact that the Law Society of Scotland is the statutory register of solicitors. It is already committed to the task that the Scottish Legal Aid Board has in mind in forming the registration system envisaged. On that basis, my right hon. Friend should look favourably on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendments. The Scottish Legal Aid Board should be required to consult the Law Society of Scotland in determining the form that an application for entry to the criminal legal aid assistance register shall take and which documents shall accompany it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is correct that applications for entry to the register should be the responsibility of the board, as it will be responsible for considering the applications received. That is entirely consistent with what happens with applications for legal aid. I listened carefully to my hon. Friend and can see the persuasiveness of the argument for introducing a requirement that the board should consult. Such consultation would be primarily with the Law Society. It could also include other bodies. There should also be a deadline for a full response so that consultation cannot be used to delay setting arrangements in place. Given the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr I am prepared to bring forward such a provision on consultation. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured by that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Minister has said, but should like to be clear about it. Pages 44 and 45 contain a series of conditions that have to be complied with before solicitors can be on the register. That is the code of practice. We are agreeing to consult the Law Society of Scotland about something that is written into the Bill. Is not it a bit late to be agreeing that now? The code is in the Bill and is likely to be agreed this evening. Will the Law Society be able to persuade the Minister that any of the criteria set out on pages 44, 45 and 46 can be removed from the Bill? Will the Law Society have the ability to persuade the Scottish Legal Aid Board to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed to require the Scottish Legal Aid Board to consult with the Law Society on the form that an application for entry to the criminal legal aid register should take and on what documents should accompany such an application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue the Minister on the nature of the consultation? I assume that the vested interests involved will not have a right of veto. I understand why the Law Society must be consulted, and I welcome the idea that the Government will consult and listen more, but will the Minister recognise publicly that the Law Society has a vested interest and is opposed to everything that is being proposed here? Presumably, the society's submissions and consultation will reflect that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentlement says, that no outside body should have a veto over parliamentary proposals. It is appropriate, however, that those directly concerned should be consulted on the form of the application for entry to the criminal legal assistance register and on what documents accompany an application. Acceptance of the amendments is subject to the proviso that the board should not be confined to consulting the society and can consult other bodies, with a time limit for responses to make sure that arrangements cannot be indefinitely delayed.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 173 ensures that the power to require information under clause 48 may not be used to acquire information to ascertain whether a solicitor complies with the code of practice. Hon. Members will recognise that the powers in clause 48 are extreme, and it does not seem appropriate that they should be used for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 175 goes back to many of the general points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East and others. It would ensure that the Law Society of Scotland—not the Scottish Legal Aid Board—would prepare the code of conduct. The Law Society would consult with the board before formulating that code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr has said, the Law Society is the statutory regulator of solicitors under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. The Law Society has issued many practice rules and it already applies a code of conduct to the behaviour of solicitors. Recently, assisted by the Glasgow Bar Association and others, it formulated a code of conduct for criminal work that came into effect on 1 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal that the Scottish Legal Aid Board should create a code of practice is open to a number of criticisms, including the one that such a proposal is an inappropriate role for Government. I mean no disrespect to the board, but it is not a professional organisation: it is a state-run non-departmental Government body. It has no experience of professional administration, so the Committee should examine why the Government have taken the course outlined in the clause. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will say a little more than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
he has been able to so far on the relationship between the board and the Law Society of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 177 and 187 would ensure that solicitors are required to attend courses on professional ethics in order to qualify for registration. That is the view of the Law Society of Scotland, and it is likely to commend itself to the Committee. It is difficult to concoct an argument against such a provision. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will view it favourably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 179 and 181 would ensure that the code of practice does not include provisions relating to the conduct of defence work, but may relate to its preparation. It is inappropriate for a state body—the board—to be able to dictate the conduct of cases with the prosecution, which is another state body. In addition, if the way in which a solicitor represents his client is a matter to be regulated by the board, there is the potential for appeals following the Anderson decision earlier this year. As the Committee will recall, the Anderson decision upheld the right and obligation of a solicitor to exercise his or her professional judgment in the conduct of a trial. Endless numbers of appeals are possible as a result of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 180 would ensure that a solicitor will be able to exercise his or her professional judgment in the conduct of case. Such a provision is not explicit in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final two amendments relate to small firms. Amendment No. 178 would ensure that solicitors' businesses will have discretion about the form in which records are kept. That is particularly important to small solicitors' firms that may not follow the systems adopted by large ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 186 would ensure that the number of cases a solicitor conducts should not be a factor in monitoring his performance. The Bill will provide for that factor to be considered, but, by definition, that is a bias against small firms and those in rural areas. There is no good reason for that provision and it is a simple matter to amend the Bill. The amendment would reassure many small firms who fear that the Bill will make life more difficult for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in speaking to amendment No. 235. I should like to probe the Government on their intentions. The amendment, supplied by the Law Society, seeks to delete provisions contained in new section 25B. Those provisions would require the Scottish Legal Aid Board to prepare a draft code of practice to regulate
	<br><q><p>"the standards of conduct expected of a solicitor providing or proposing to provide criminal legal aid assistance"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"the manner in which a solicitor should conduct a case and represent his client, including"</p></q>
five points that I should like the Minister to address. They are:
	<ol>
	<li>the passsage of timeous and accurate information to the client in relation to his case;</li>
	<li>the frequency of meetings with the client;</li>
	<li>the giving of advice to the client as to the consequences of any decision made by the client in relation to his defence;</li>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
	<li>the taking of such precognitions as may be necessary;</li>
	<li>the conduct of relations with the prosecutions;</li>
</ol>
I should like to hear the Minister's view on those, in particular on the last of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society is concerned and finds it "objectionable" that one state body should be in a position to dictate the manner in which an independent person representing a client accused of a crime should conduct its relations with another state body, the prosecution. I accept that state bodies have relations with each other. The prosecution, in the shape of an individual employed by the state, may petition a judge, who is another individual employed by the state, but that judge would have an independent mind and would make an independent assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the member for Eastwood who has made an excellent case for his amendments, particularly on professional ethics. I am sure that every hon. Member agrees with what he said about rural towns and the small solicitor who handles a small number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 185 contains another element on which concern has been expressed by the Law Society. It is the matter of who would investigate alleged malpractice, the suggestions being that a commercial rival should not have access to papers from someone with whom he is liable to be in competition. I do not go along with the Law Society, which wants an amendment that would allow it to determine who are the investigators. But some words of comfort would be helpful from the Minister about Chinese walls within the Scottish Legal Aid Board by which the investigators and the board-appointed solicitors wouild be kept apart. If such an assurance was forthcoming, I feel sure no problems would arise in that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some questions for the Minister about the code of practice. First, if we are to consider how solicitors conduct a case for the defence, can we also consider how the prosecution case is conducted? I have talked to relatives of murder victims who have complained that they felt clear evidence found by the police had, inexplicably, not been used by the prosecution. The reletives felt that the accused had got off altogether or got a lighter sentence simply because the prosecution failed to present relevant evidence that the families had heard about from the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what is meant by new section 25B(1)(c)(iv). It refers to
	<br><q><p>"the taking of such precognitions as may be necessary".</p></q>
The question is, who decides what is necessary. What sort of judgment is being made on that? I also do not know what section 25B(1)(c)(v) means when it says,
	<br><q><p>"the conduct of relations with the prosecution".</p></q>
What is the relevance of that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new section 25B(1)(f) might amount to excessive interference in the way a practice conducts its internal affairs. Perhaps there are good reasons for requiring such detailed recording of how books and accounts are maintained, and of office procedures, but I wonder if the nanny state might not be creeping in, from a surprising quarter. I am reminded of the complaint that teachers make about being required to fill in so

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
many forms to satisfy bureaucracy that they do not have enough time to prepare lessons. Could that possibly be the effect of the provision? If so, I should, for the first time in my life, be in agreement with the hon. Member for Eastwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's amendments, particularly No. 186, which removes any focus on small firms. The intention behind the amendment is relevant to rural areas. Those areas have only small firms of solicitors. However, the partners often have a wealth of experience and are well able to conduct legally aided cases. I do not think that small firms should be penalised in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr for his points about amendment No. 185. I appreciate the concern that he raised and can reassure him that, although the Scottish Legal Aid Board will be responsible for employing both public defenders and investigators, there will be a wall between the functions. The board would not use information gained from an investigation under sections 35A and 35B to give a competitive advantage to public defenders. We shall consider the matter further and on Report shall deal with my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Members who have provided such helpful explanations for the numerous amendments which appear with amendment No. 173 in this group. The amendments concern two issues. They would adjust the provisions relating to the proposed code of practice and would transfer from the Scottish Legal Aid Board to the society the responsibility for preparing the code and for investigation. They are detailed and fairly technical. I will turn first to the issue of adjusting the provisions that the code of practice may contain. It will not surprise hon. Members that I will be unable to accept a number of the amendments put forward, but others raised useful points and deserve serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 276 simply allows different provision to be made in the code for solicitors and firms. That is uncontroversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood spoke about amendments Nos. 177 and 187 which are intended to insert professional ethics into the code. That was always the intention and we shall certainly consider what amendments may be required on Report to clarify the position. The point that was made about the principle with respect to small firms was a good one. We agree to that principle, and I shall return to that subject later. As to the code, there would be consultation with the Law Society, and we should co-operate with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 179 would make the standards in the proposed code of practice which relate to the manner in which a solicitor should conduct a case and represent his client subject to his professional judgment. That would undermine the intention that the code should set out a standard of necessary work to be undertaken under criminal legal assistance. There is no intention to interfere with professional judgment, which will always guide members of the legal and other professionals.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
However, the code will establish objective and measurable standards. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood asked about the Anderson decision. The Government have no intention of interfering with a solicitor's professional judgment. However, the code could be used as evidence in a similar case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 180, 181, 182 and 235 would remove any references to providing information, frequency of meetings and giving advice to the client. Surely it is important that the client is aware of how a case is progressing and the implications of his or her decisions. I think that it is right for those issues to be addressed in the code. The amendments, which seek to restrict the board's interests to the preparatory phase of a case, seem difficult to sustain given the considerable sums of public money involved in the court process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 203, 204, 205, 175, 189, 192, 185 and 258 reflect a proposal that the Law Society rather than the board should be responsible for making and publishing the code of practice, and monitoring compliance with it. The Government recognise that the Law Society is committed to high standards of professional practice for criminal defence work. We have seen the society's recently published code of conduct on that subject. I commend it as a major step towards clarifying and improving standards. We believe, however, that it is right that the Scottish Legal Aid Board, which is responsible for stewardship of the Legal Aid Fund, should formulate a code of practice that relates particularly to the supply of criminal legal assistance. Such a code would be consistent with the Law Society's code, but would go further than the Law Society's code because it would cover various matters that were especially relevant to legal aid. It follows that the board must also have power to monitor compliance with the code of practice. Therefore, I must resist the amendments. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we propose to recognise the important role of the Law Society in relation to the code of practice. We will bring forward amendments on Report that will provide that the board is obliged to consult the Law Society about the code. The society would not be specified as the only body to be consulted, as the board may wish to consult other bodies, but it would be mentioned in the Bill. We would also wish to set a time limit for responses by any consulted bodies, to ensure that there was no undue delay in finalising the code of practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the Government will consult the Law Society and other bodies. He has referred to "other bodies" often, but he has not identified them. I am sure that the Minister is now in a position to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am. We shall consult the Scottish Consumer Council on consumer interests and we shall also consult Scottish citizens advice bureaux. My officials have confirmed that answer, so it is certainly correct.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
confirm that those are the two bodies that we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 186 is different in that it seeks to remove from the Bill any reference to the code, including consideration of the number of cases handled by a solicitor. I accept that that could be seen to affect small, rural firms, which we have no desire to deter from registration. My hon. Friends the Members for Ayr and for Eastwood and my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries made that point. I therefore accept amendment No. 186 in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of giving the board the powers in the proposed sections 35A and 35B of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 can be explained simply. It is to ensure that, if and when the board approaches the Law Society of Scotland with a complaint, it has as much information as possible about the alleged abuse of legal aid to convince the society that the complaint is to be taken seriously. The same applies with even more force to any approach by the board to the Scottish solicitors discipline tribunal or to the police or procurator fiscal.

We have heard a great deal about client confidentiality in relation to the exercise of the powers. However, the board already receives a great deal of information—which is covered by client confidentiality—about, for example, the client's means and the strength of the client's case. That is why the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 contains an offence provision that prevents an officer of the board from disclosing information gained in an investigation any more widely.

I stress again that Govenment amendment No. 278, which we shall discuss later, will ensure that only solicitors, their firms, and employees and partners will be subject to the powers. There is no question of other professions or clients being made liable to produce information or documents.

I shall now deal with the proposition that the Law Society of Scotland should exercise the powers envisaged in section 35A at the insistence of the board. I appreciate that that proposal has been advanced because, under our policy, the legal profession is self-regulating. We have no intention of undermining the self-regulating status of the legal profession. The board, rather than the Law Society, will be given the powers in order to safeguard the taxpayer. The board is responsible for proper stewardship.
