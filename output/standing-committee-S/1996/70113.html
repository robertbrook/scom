	<section>
	<div class='title'>Administration of Justice (Expenditure)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the impact of the recently announced Government expenditure proposals on the administration of justice in Scotland; and if he will make a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's plans allow for 187 extra operational police officers, £2 million more for running the sheriff and supreme courts and enough money for the Prison Service to cope with increased prisoner numbers. I am satisfied that those increases will ensure the efficient administration of justice throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman join me in praising the staff of the Scottish Prison Service, in particular for the skill and bravery they have shown over the Christmas and new year period when dealing with a spate of incidents? For example, in my constituency there has been a rooftop protest, a hostage-taking and, now, an attempted suicide bid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that there is a developing crisis in our prisons and that the time is ripe for a wholesale review of the financing and working of our prison system, especially in view of the expected increase in prisoner numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's policy is to ensure that there are sufficient prison places available to meet the disposals of the courts. We are making provision for a new prison, which will be funded under the private finance initiative. The chief executive of the Prison Service has made it clear that he believes that the service is performing well. It has consistently met all of its targets each year—and each year those targets have been made tougher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady that the staff of the Prison Service are to be congratulated on the difficult task that they carry out, without our prison system, of looking after some of the most difficult people in our country. They will continue to have the Government's support, both in resources and through the policies that are being implemented throughout the Scottish Prison Service with considerable success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the Government's expenditure proposals will not reduce the enormous delay between people being charged by the police and their being brought to court? Is he aware
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
that there are many cases in my constituency of people awaiting trial for 12 to 18 months? Is he further aware that the Minister of State has refused to accept a Labour proposal for the publication of league tables for courts and for offences, which would speed up the administration of justice? There are too many delays and the Government are not doing enough to remedy the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State has certainly not rejected such a proposal. I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman is a convert to—or, at least, has abandoned his party's opposition to—the publication of information about the performance of the courts. Of course, we already provide a degree of information, not all of which is made public. I plan to ensure that people are aware not just of the sentencing policies in different courts, where there is a wide variation, but of the performance of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need to ensure that the administration of justice is speeded up. Provisions that have been set out in the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill and in previous legislation are designed precisely to achieve that. I look forward to seeing the hon. Gentleman supporting the Government in the Lobby on Wednesday for the Third Reading of the current Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that Glenochill prison probably has the greatest concentration of long-term, difficult prisoners? Does he appreciate the success last week—and it was a success—of the staff and the negotiating teams in ending the hostage problem? Did not Mr. Frizell's breathtaking complacency in his interview on the radio yesterday show that the Government are wholly unaware of the difficulties that will arise from the likely reduction in the remission and parole arrangements if the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill becomes law? Does not he realise that the position in Scottish prisons will only get worse if long-term, difficult prisoners have no prospect of sufficient reward for behaving well and trying to rehabilitate themselves in the hope of gaining freedom as quickly as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between me and the hon. Gentleman. The Government believe that our fundamental duty is the protection of the public and that we must therefore organise the prison system in a way that ensures that. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to caricature our proposal to allow remission to be limited to one sixth as not recognising for good behaviour. On the contrary, we are changing a system that allows people automatic release at the half-way point of their sentences to one where they have to serve five sixths of their sentences and will get the one sixth remission only if they have demonstrated good behaviour and a commitment to taking part in training and other courses that may help them to deal with their offending behaviour or dependencies on drugs or alcohol. That seem to me to be the right way forward. The hon. Gentleman appears to be rather out of sorts with even the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Common Fisheries Policy</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when he last met representatives of the Scottish Fisherman's Federation to discuss the common fisheries policy; and if he will make a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I last met representatives of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation on 19 and 20 December in Brussels, before, during and after the December Fisheries Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What accuracy was there in the newspaper reports of a very short and acrimonious meeting between the Minister and the Fisheries Commissioner? I understand that the Minister goes to Europe as a junior to his English counterpart, but what hope is there for any sensible and much needed reform of the CFP when the Scottish Minister is relishing in getting the bum's rush from the European Commissioner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that the case for salmon is not linked in any way to the CFP. When I go to Brussels, I go with the full weight of Her Majesty's Government behind me. I go in partnership with the hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. That is far removed from what an independent Scotland would experience, marginalised on the fringes of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the importance of salmon farming for the Scottish economy and for jobs in Scotland, can my hon. Friend tell me a little about his discussions with the Fisheries Commissioner and about his trip to Norway? He has done so much to try to introduce a minimum import price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I again raised the question of the introduction of minimum import prices at the December Fisheries Council. It is a matter of real regret that Mrs. Bonino, the Fisheries Commissioner, has once again refused our request. I thank my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary for raising the matter with Mr. Santer, in the margins of the Dublin summit. On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I have invited the Fisheries Commissioner to visit Scotland to meet and to put her case to Scotland's salmon farmers. I look forward to accompanying her around Scotland, as she should find it an interesting and informative tour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that all sectors of Scotland's fishing industry must operate within the CFP, including the village-based fishing industry to be found in my constituency and on other parts of east coast. Will the hon. Gentleman now reconsider his previous refusal to establish a task force to examine the particular problems faced by the village-based industry in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
my constituency and elsewhere? As he was told when he visited Pittenweem a few months ago, unless something is done the village-based industry will continue its slow decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for inviting me to his constituency in the summer. I had an enjoyable and useful tour around some of his villages. As I said then, a number of initiatives are available for the community-based fishing industry in his constituency and elsewhere. I want to encourage his fishermen to come to talk to officials and also to me again to see what we can do. The hon. and learned Gentleman is right to suggest that the CFP is not fulfilling its objectives, which is why the Government are committed to a root-and-branch reform of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Beef Herds (Traceability)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when he expects a traceability scheme for Scottish beef herds to be in place; and if he will make a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Office issued a consultation paper on the Government's proposals for a British cattle traceability system on 10 December. I am committed to ensuring that the traceability system is introduced as quickly as is practicably possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman admit that the Government's disastrous handling of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy problem has cost the taxpayer £2 billion, with no end to the problem in sight? Given that European Ministers will support a zonal or regional exemption to the blanket ban if requested by the British Government, will he now ask for an exemption for Scotland? When will the Government implement a national database for Scottish beef herds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The £2 billion to which the hon. Gentleman referred is money that we have provided to support the beef industry in our country and Scotland has benefited considerably from that. I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman attacking the Government for having made that money available to support an industry that has had an unfair ban placed upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's point about a regional solution and his assertion that the Government have not asked for that, I can tell him that I spoke to the Commissioner about his attitude towards the Scottish National party's view that Scotland could go it alone on the selective cull. It was made quite clear to me that that was not a runner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the five conditions of the Florence agreement are now in place and I look forward to the ban being lifted, as it was unjustifiably imposed. An independent Scotland would have as much influence in Europe as a gnat compared with the influence of the British Government on those important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Road Building</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the 1997–98 road building programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The programme will include improving the A74 to motorway standard; the M8 Newbridge underpass; bypasses for Blackburn and Kintore on the A96; and the beginning of the widening of the M8 between Baillieston and Shotts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Girvan and Maybole bypasses are once again not included in the programme, although they are both vital to road safety and the environment? Is not it clear that just as the decisions on the priority partnership areas were made by the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), on the basis of political judgments, decisions on road building are being made for the benefit of Tory marginal seats such as the Minister's, and not on objective environmental and road-safety grounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Decisions are made on the basis of needs throughout Scotland. The Government will be investing more than £521 million on roads during the next three years; although the project mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is not included immediately, I can tell him that between 1998 and 2000 construction will begin on the A75 the Glen, the Al Haddington to Dunbar dual carriageway, the M77 close to Fenwick, which is quite close to the hon. Gentleman's constituency, and the substantial M80 project. Those are all substantial advances; not everything can be done at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. and learned Friend accept my congratulations on the magnificent improvements to Scottish roads in recent times, made against the wishes of Opposition Members, who are always moaning and groaning about the level of expenditure on roads—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that substantial progress has been made. Steady progress is being made in completing Scotland's motorway network; the M8 and M80 projects are due to be started soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Secretary of State convey my appreciation to the Scottish Office roads directorate for its good work in extending the dual carriageway Al at Haddington? When will the next section be started towards Dunbar? What representations is the Minister making to the Department of Transport south of the border? There is not much point in the Al being a dual carriageway in Scotland if it is to remain a cart track in Northumberland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Work will start between 1998 and 2000; I remain in close touch with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, and have been in touch with him during the past two or three days on that important subject. However, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that he must convince not only the Government, but those on his own Front Bench of the importance of the Al.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Community Care (Quality)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what recent assessment he has made of the quality of community care services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The quality of community care services in Scotland is monitored on an on-going basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the Government's policies on community care are, far from promoting quality, leading to a two-tier service, based on the ability to pay, and are driven by market mechanisms? Does he further agree that the cuts forced on local government will remove choice and flexibility, lead to job losses and place an even greater burden on Scotland's 700,000 parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities have £662 million in 1996–97 to meet their community care responsibilities; for 1997–98, the grant-aided expenditure allocation includes an additional allowance of £48.4 million for community care. The inspection of Tayside showed quite conclusively that the three authorities could achieve long-term savings of between £3 million and £6 million if they made greater use of the private sector in order to achieve comparable quality. I am happy to involve the community care implementation unit in any local discussions, and for it to give guidance; but if local authorities pursue greater value for money, they will find that they can achieve a great deal more than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. and learned Friend realise that the inspection on Tayside of community care demonstrated clearly that savings of up to £200 a week per person could be achieved by transferring people from public sector nursing homes into the private sector? Is it not the case that, throughout Scotland, many millions of pounds could be transferred in that way? Many more people could thus be catered for; and there would be no need for the so-called reductions and cuts. The local authorities have the power to make decisions; they should be enablers, not providers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is right. Many more people would be treated. We believe that £20 million more could be used to provide services of comparable quality. Given the substantial increase in community care funding of £48.4 million, three should be scope to increase front-line services, provided that councils fund pay increases from efficiency savings and look for the most effective way to deliver services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Inward Investment (Glasgow)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>6. 	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland which inward investment projects have been attracted to the city of Glasgow by Locate in Scotland in the last three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inward investment attracted to Glasgow in the past three years includes projects by the Trustee Savings bank, Abbey National, Atlantic Information Systems, Patrol Jeanswear, PCL Group, MIC Textiles, Mabbatt and Associates Inc., British Telecom and, of course, Polaroid, which announced last month that its new international business centre will be located in the city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is interesting not for what he said but for what he did not say. Is it not the case that overseas investment in Glasgow is much less than it could be if it were properly encouraged? Is it not also the case that investment in the manufacturing sector is almost non-existent, which is an absolute disgrace given the city's history? Is that not yet another example of Tory party discrimination against Glasgow? When will the Minister do something positive to reverse that trend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the honourable Gentleman takes that view and does not understand that inward investors are not directed to one part of Scotland or another—they go where they believe is best for their business. In fact, Glasgow has established a good reputation as a call-centre base. I would have hoped that the honourable Gentleman would have recognised that and praised the successes of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman does not recognise that the labour party's policies would be detrimental to inward investment as they would hit the competitiveness of business in Scotland. [HON. MEMBERS: "Boring."] The Opposition Members who are shouting "Boring" show their attitude towards wealth creation in Scotland. They do not recognise that business must be competitive, or that the Government's policies are successful, which is why we attract so many inward investors into the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that one of the most important ways to attract investment to Glasgow is to have good local government services for the citizens
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
of the city and, therefore, make it attractive to people? Does not he also agree that the savage cuts that the Government have imposed on the local city council, which mean that it must cut various services, does nothing to help inward investment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have hoped that the honourable Gentleman would have told Glasgow city council that it will be counter-productive to potential inward investment to spend £400,000 on the Scottish Trades Union Congress centenary in which red dye will be poured into the River Clyde. I do not know what that will do for the citizens of Glasgow; certainly, it will do nothing to encourage inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) should consider the Labour party's policy on the uniform business rate which affects local government. His last utterance under instruction from Islington stated that the uniform business rate would go up by the band D domestic rate increase. That would have meant a 20 per cent. increase in business rates in Glasgow last year, which would have been damaging to any inward or indigenous investor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have asked that supplementary questions be brief; Ministers must also be brief in their replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition warmly welcome the inward investments that have come to Scotland and, as the Minister outlined, to Glasgow. I congratulate all those responsible for bringing those new jobs to Scotland and also the inward investors, who have undoubtedly been attracted to Scotland by the fact that there is likely to be a change in the Administration in the very near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That good news is offset, however, by the bleakness of last week's news that Marshall's will close its factory in Coatbridge. Throughout Scotland, there is dismay and disgust at the indifference and apathy shown by Ministers to that news. When the Secretary of State has eventually left Scotland for Kensington, Chelsea or points south, he will be remembered not the for Korean or Japanese jobs that he brought to Scotland but for the 57,000 jobs that have been destroyed in Scotland during the past year—the year when he supervised the Scottish economy. He will enjoy a reputation not for bringing a handful of Korean or Japanese jobs to Scotland but for the destruction of jobs and the consequent lack of opportunities for Scottish people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to Marshall's Chickens and I agree that that news was not welcome. I have ensured that the local enterprise company and my officials in the Scottish Office will continue to be in discussion with Marshall's to make sure that all avenues have been explored concerning the Coatbridge site. I should point out that Marshall's is developing elsewhere in Scotland and that it has to live in a competitive environment and succeed in the world market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman at least recognises the fact that we have been successful in attracting inward investment because we have the right policies. I hope that he will consider the implications on business of his tax-raising

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend last met COSLA on 8 November 1996 to discuss local government funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that when the Minister meets COSLA today he will be told that this year's settlement is a 3 per cent. cut in real terms. Is he aware of the evidence given to the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs by the health service trusts about the social services transitional budgets? The Select Committee was told that the whole budget of £33 million would need to be spent by April to deal with the bed-blocking and waiting list problems. What message are the Government sending to the elderly in Scotland? If that is how they care for the elderly, it is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The message is that the total grant-aided expenditure allocation for local authority expenditure on social work services will increase from £950 million in the current year to more than £1,010 million in 1997–98. We are bringing forward directions on transparency of funding for elderly people in residential and nursing-home care. We believe that local authorities can achieve a great deal more if they have regard to value for money. I repeat the general point that I made earlier: councils can help next year's council tax levels by taking more effective action to collect outstanding local taxes, which total £443 million in community charge income and £278 million in council tax income still owed. If councils collect those sums, they will be in a much stronger position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that private sector residential and nursing homes are being built that will accommodate more than 100 inmates? Leaving aside the fact that community care seems to have been designed simply to transfer public money into private sector pockets, how can substituting private institutional care for public institutional care meet the criteria for good, sound community care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of the inspections by the inspectorate, which is independent, is to make absolutely certain that appropriate quality standards are being met. There are various ways to do that, not just through inspections but through the Mental Welfare Commission, the Scottish hospital advisory service, visits by the community care implementation unit, and through research and the local authority complaints procedure. The public have the right to know the facts and figures, which is why we are giving directions on the transparency of funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision for police grant-aided expenditure in 1996–97 amounts to £620 million, which is 7.7 per cent. more than the comparable figure for 1995–96. In addition, we have recently announced the provision of £2 million in supplementary capital allocations to police forces and to the Scottish Criminal Record Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend and I wish, once again, to compare the performance of the Government with the intentions of Opposition Members. What additional resources does my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that closed circuit television has been an enormous success. We had a challenge fund for that purpose and, because the number of applications exceeded the funds available, I provided funding in full to ensure that all projects could go ahead. CCTV is something that we wish to encourage in the coming year and, once again, we shall be asking local authorities to put forward schemes that have been immensely successful in reducing crime in our town centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly keen to see such an initiative, using the technology that is now available, in areas outwith the main urban centres. It can be used in small towns and villages, and I know that several local authorities are keen to take advantage of such an opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be aware that crime has doubled under this Government. Do he and his Government accept any responsibility for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that the Government should accept responsibility for the increase, presumably he will give them credit for the fall in crime that has taken place in recent years. We are not, however, complacent. It is still the case that crimes of violence are increasing, which is why we have a tough law and order Bill before the House on which the Opposition have proved to be somewhat uncertain as to their policy. We are determined to give the police the support that they need, to put more police officers on the beat and to encourage operations such as Operation Spotlight, which make it absolutely clear that there will be "zero tolerance" of crime on our streets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to ask about the HLCAs. One measure that has not been taken to help remote and rural island areas is the exemption that is allowed for the transport of live animals. Is the Minister aware that that exemption is allowed under the European directive? I am sure he understands that for island farmers in particular to get their animals to market, their livelihoods depend on that. If the Government do not intend to be flexible over the matter, we will blame them, not the European Union, for having a bias against the highlands and islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that the market for livestock in the highlands would be greatly strengthened by the elimination of enzootic abortion in the sheep industry? The work of the Highlands and Islands Sheep Health Association would be greatly assisted if the costs of the prophylactic treatment were supported by a Government scheme for the smaller crofters and farmers whose absence from the scheme could put it under threat.

I understand that the solicitors took several months to clarify details of the legal aid account. The board was entitled to retain sums awarded to Mr. MacKenzie by the other party, lodged by Mr. MacKenzie's solicitors until the legal aid account had been settled. Part of the principal sum was retained to cover the possible gap between judicial expenses conceded by the other party and the legal aid account.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will undoubtedly hear this Friday that, despite the new burdens and nursery vouchers that the Government have imposed, the increase in capping levels will be only 0.4 per cent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall avoid that subject, although it is valid to say that taxes have not been collected. The hon.

The Labour party and some local authorities are calling for more funds for local government even though the Government have increased funds this year. Funds from central taxation are going to local authorities in Scotland, which receive 42 per cent.

Authorities have enjoyed the benefits of reorganisation—they have moved from two tiers to one—and of rationalism and better efficiency.

	<p>11.21 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this debate on Scotland in the world. I have to say that I almost began by referring to you, Mr. Martin, as Lord Provost. To stand and speak in this Chamber is a strange experience for me: the last time that I did so was some 23 years ago, when I was the councillor representing the Newington ward on the old Edinburgh town council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That strange feeling of deja vu is exacerbated by the fact that the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) was at that time also a member of the council, being councillor for the Holyrood ward. In addition, the Minister of State, Scottish Office, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), was the councillor for the Barnton ward. Yet it was the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) who lorded over us all, because he was a bailie of the old Edinburgh corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A bailie was a very important person. One—and it might have been the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley—was reputed to have told some miscreant that he would fine him £50 and to have added that, if there had been any evidence against him, the man would have been sent to prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I plead not guilty to that charge, but I remember events in this Chamber very well. I remember that the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) was at that time one of the most fervent, passionate and articulate advocates for devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, we have returned devolution to the city of Edinburgh, which is now an all-purpose authority. That was well worth achieving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people may consider it inappropriate to discuss Scotland in the world in this Chamber, but their number will not include anyone familiar with the history of Edinburgh local government. Lord Cockburn,s memoirs of Edinburgh city council during the Napoleonic wars reveal that in 1796 the council resolved to ruin the French by abstaining from drinking claret at all municipal festivals. However, he went on to write that the vow was not kept and so the French were not ruined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if Edinburgh council was not able to have a major impact on the affairs of Europe, the 18th century was a remarkable period. It was the time of Edinburgh's golden age and Scottish enlightenment. The city was the Athens of the north and people of the extraordinary stature of David Hume, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson and many others in many walks of life were prominent in the life of Scotland and Britain, and also made a major international impact on the European civilisation of their day. Nationalists and those who yearn for a Scottish Parliament
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
have not been able to explain that phenomenon. They constantly maintain that the absence of a Scottish Parliament destroys Scotland's international identity and our ability as a nation to realise our destiny, yet they have never come to terms with the fact that Scotland enjoyed its golden age in the decades after the Act of Union, when Scottish enlightenment made an unprecedented contribution to the history and culture of Europe as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act of Union, far from stifling Scotland's identity, acted as a midwife, bringing forward this extraordinary progeny. That is something that all Scots can warmly welcome. Although the days of the Scottish enlightenment and of that golden age may be in the past, there have also been extraordinary developments in Scottish life and culture in recent years. Far from the Union and the United Kingdom Government having inhibited those development, the expression of Scotland's identity both at home and abroad has been consistent with its unionist form of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years we have seen an extraordinary flowering of Gaelic language and culture. That has happened not despite Government but in accordance with the wishes of the Gaelic community and with substantial and unprecedented extra financial support from the Government for the Gaelic-speaking community. When I was Secretary of State for Scotland, I was proud to be able to assist in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 20 years-the years of Thatcherism and Tory domination-the highlands and islands of Scotland have, for the first time since the 19th century, enjoyed an end to depopulation and have enjoyed unprecedented growth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Foreign Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman, may I say that the transport improvement—which was funded by the Government—as well as the genius of the people of the highlands and islands has contributed to that revival, which I know the hon. Gentleman will welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly pay tribute to the genius of the people of the highlands and islands, who rumbled the Tories a long time ago—that is why there are no Tory Members of Parliament there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Foreign Secretary is in nostalgic mood, perhaps he will cast his mind back to the imprint that he left on the highlands and islands when he was Secretary of State for Scotland: the poisoned legacy of the high-toll Skye bridge. What contribution is that making to the economic well-being either of Skye or the westerns isles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a selective memory. He knows perfectly well that the decision to build a privately funded bridge was one that he and his hon. Friends welcomed until they were satisfied that the decision to build it was irreversible; history records that only then did they start to campaign against the method of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Scotland's place in the world, the fundamental issue that all of us Scots are addressing is whether Scotland's identity and national character require
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
fundamental constitutional change. The Scottish National party starts from the premise that, if Scotland is to realise its national character and make its full contribution to the world, there must be a separate Scottish state. It, firmly believes in that, and suggests, that that is the course of international history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP yearns for that seat for Scotland in the United Nations, between Saudi Arabia and Senegal. It points to the end of the British Empire and other empires, which has led to a massive expansion in the number of states so that the United Nations now has some 180 members, and it says, "Why not Scotland? Why should not Scotland be one of the 180 countries that have a separate seat in the UN? It should be part of that 20th century development that we have seen elsewhere".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the SNP make two fundamental mistakes in the advocacy of their particular philosophy. First, they fail to realise that for many of the new states that have emerged in recent years as the result of the end of empires—there are many in Africa, the middle east, the Caribbean and the Pacific—it has been necessary to create a state in order to try to build a nation. The nations had not existed in the past. The boundaries of those states are the inherited boundaries of the old colonial empires and it has been a necessary step in the process of nation-building to establish first the state—in Africa, the middle east, the West Indies and the Pacific—in order then to build a new nation. Members of the SNP would be the first to agree with me that that is not Scotland's situation. Scotland's national identity has continued over the centuries. There is no need to create a Scottish national identity—it is alive, well and flourishing. That is the first historic mistake, with which the nationalists are unable to come to terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the SNP consistently make a second mistake. They point to the fact that as the British empire has disappeared, so the countries of the Commonwealth have emerged as separate states. They ask why Scotland should not benefit in the same way. They fail to understand that the end of empire was the process of decolonisation. It was an end to colonies. Scotland has never been a colony. Even the most blind nationalist would not seriously maintain that Scotland has had a colonial relationship with the United Kingdom or the British Empire. The hon. Gentleman must come to terms with the simple fact that Scotland was not subjected to colonisation; that Scots, along with the English, were the colonisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Foreign Secretary seems to have forgotten an interview that he gave some years ago when he was reported to have compared his powers as Secretary of State for Scotland to those of a colonial governor. I am not surprised that he rested his argument on a 200-year-old story. Will he now address the modern day? How would he assess Ireland's contribution, as an independent state, to the European Community in the past six months? Is he surprised by the House of Commons Library figures which show that Ireland will overtake the United Kingdom in wealth per head by 2000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I know Ireland at least as well as he does. I know that levels of unemployment there are far higher than in Scotland

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
and that the standard of living is far lower. If that is the model to which he aspires, God help the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that I was making before I gave way to the hon. Gentleman. Scots historically were part of the colonising process. Scots went out with others and colonised north America, Australia, New Zealand and southern Africa. The Scots, with the English and others, helped rule India, Asia and Africa. To argue that the end of empire must lead to the ascent of Scottish nationalism is an extraordinary proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at nationalism around the world, one finds that in most parts of the world it has developed as a result of the ascent of oppression by a foreign power. Scottish nationalism has never been based on a sense of oppression by England, but is based on a sense of occasional irritation with England. That is a totally different political phenomenon, as the Committee well knows. It is when nationalism arises from a sense of oppression that one sees the emergence of great national liberators—a Nelson Mandela, a Mahatma Gandhi or a Charles Stewart Parnell. They arose in their respective countries because there was a sense of oppression in those countries. Scottish nationalism is of a different order and that is why it has not produced a Mandela, Gandhi or Parnell. We have had to make do with the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) and that speaks loud words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I supported Mr. Mandela many years ago because, unlike the hon. Lady, I lived in southern Africa and I have been aware of his extraordinary abilities since the 1960s. I visited Robbeneiland where he was incarcerated and I know well what an extraordinary contribution he has made. He came from a system where oppression existed and needed to be replaced. Whatever the fantasies of SNP Members, Scottish nationalism comes from a totally different political experience and that point needs to be understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there are concerns and frustrations about the relationship between Scotland and England, but that can never be the basis for breaking up one of the greatest unions that Europe has ever known. The Balkanisation of Britain, which is what the nationalists stand for, would not only be a disaster for the people of Scotland and a matter of great grief for the people of England, but would cause dismay throughout Europe and the international community. It would imply that even in a modern, successful society such as the United Kingdom, where there is a common language and culture, a common set of values and a common history, and where people have lived without bloodshed for almost 300 years, a political union cannot succeed. That would be a matter of enormous dismay throughout the length and breadth of the western world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to consider the dismay among all right-thinking people at the possible break-up of Canada and their sadness at contemplating the possibility that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Quebec and the rest of Canada might agree to separate. That might give pleasure to a few misguided individuals, but for most it would represent a massive step backwards at a time when the world is trying to grow closer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. However, what I do know is that the sort of constitutional structure that Canada is experiencing at the moment is not one that the Labour party is proposing for Scotland. We can contemplate the hon. Gentleman's question on another occasion. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I must get on with my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The political philosophy represented by nationalism is not only irrelevant to Scotland's needs, it is not in accordance with the international aspirations and objectives that we should be taking forward. When we go beyond the philosophy to the actual policies of the nationalists on how an independent Scotland would operate, there is real cause for alarm—Scotland would be impotent even by the nationalists' standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nationalists want Scotland to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, but unlike Switzerland or Sweden, Scotland would not then enjoy armed neutrality, but would be impotent and irrelevant in the European scene. A few years ago I would have compared their policy for an independent, separate Scotland with that of Albania. There is the same element of fantasy. I recall an Albanian President, a few years ago, saying that Albania was a very important country: if one added its population to that of China, that would make up one quarter of the world. That is the sort of fantasy that nationalists then represented. However, to say that today would be unfair to Albania, which it is now seeking to join NATO. Albania, along with all the new democracies of central and eastern Europe, wishes to join NATO, whereas the Scottish Nationalists want to take Scotland out. If Albania came in, Alba, under the Scottish Nationalists, would no doubt leave and would be the only country seeking to abandon the finest defence alliance that the western world has known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. and learned Gentleman describe independent Ireland as impotent and irrelevant in Europe, in the way that he has described Scotland? Is Ireland impotent and irrelevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that question easily. To compare the influence not just of Ireland, but of Luxembourg or any of the other small countries of the European Union with the influence of Germany, Britain or France, is quite straightforward. The SNP made an extraordinary comment in its policy document. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a small independent country, Scotland can have considerable influence in a Europe which is increasingly dominated by small member states."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman should tell that to Helmut Kohl. It is one of the most foolish and absurd propositions that I have heard for a long time. He should be more sensible when putting forward his party's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the Scottish Nationalists' proposals for the armed forces? When I was Secretary of State for Defence, I was privileged to be responsible for the armed forces of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
the United Kingdom. Having seen what is being offered by the Scottish Nationalists for an independent, separate Scotland, I am alarmed for the future of the Scotland that is my home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Scottish Nationalists' proposals for a Scottish army? What of the fine Scottish regiments which, together with our colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom, fought at Waterloo, at Flanders, in the South Atlantic and elsewhere? What is to be their responsibility in a Scotland that is out of NATO and reduced to a rump? Essentially, they will be restricted to patrolling the Cheviots with an occasional foray against Hadrian's wall. That will be the limit of their operational responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the Royal Navy? What future would there be for Yarrow if the Royal Navy were to continue to operate for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but no longer have any remit in Scotland? Does the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan seriously expect the shipyard of a separate country to be invited to build ships for the Royal Navy? It has never had ships built other than in the United Kingdom. The future for Yarrow, as well as for Faslane and Coulport, would be bleak indeed. What would be the responsibilities of a Scottish navy? Scottish sailors—in ships that were built in Scotland for the Royal Navy—and who in the past have fought at Trafalgar, at Jutland and in the south Atlantic, would be reduced to the occasional patrolling of the essential sea lanes between Gourock and Dunoon. That would be their ultimate responsibility under the hon. Gentleman's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Air Force uses Lossiemouth, Leuchars and Kinloss. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that a Scottish air force is viable on the figures announced by the SNP? It is not just theory—the SNP has announced the figures. What would be the size of the air force? I concede that it would be bigger than Luxembourg's, but smaller than everyone else's. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) is right to look pretty gloomy, because there would not be much of a future for Kinloss or Lossiemouth in such a situation—that is a simple fact and the quicker that she realises that the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Labour party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I keep allowing the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends to intervene, but shall not do so in view of his warning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate, if I may, not on a general comment on the Labour party but on the matters relevant to our international affairs. These are important matters and we know that there are crucial differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and I have often debated European policy, but I shall not go through again the issues that we have covered in the past because that would take up a great deal of the time available. I shall concentrate on certain matters specific to Scotland and raise some specific points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I know, as does any previous Secretary of State for Scotland, the crucial difficulties in winning inward investment for Scotland. The very marginal decisions that are taken determine whether companies and their work forces come to Scotland or go to Ireland, Wales or the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
north of England. I have to say to Opposition Members that despite all their fine words they must realise that if a tartan tax existed—with a differential level of taxation north of the border—that could be only bad news for the attraction of jobs and investment, whether from Japan, the United States or Korea. Ordinary common logic tells one that where people are making difficult decisions involving hundreds of millions of pounds, they must take into account whether their employees would pay differential levels of tax in Scotland compared with England or Wales. That is a factor—in some cases it may not be decisive—which would in certain cases lead to industry and jobs going elsewhere. The right hon. Member for Livingston and his hon. Friends are not doing a service to their constituents when they try to deny that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates specifically to the distinguished office of Secretary of State for Scotland. It has been occupied by many people of various political parties in the past 100 years. That office has a profound significance not just to the domestic issues that are relevant within Scotland but to the ability to propagate Scottish interests, both at United Kingdom level and in Europe and elsewhere. That has been a great asset for Scotland under successive Secretaries of State for Scotland from different political parties and should not be lightly thrown away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), who aspires to be the next Secretary of State for Scotland, that he sounds his least convincing when he says that he believes that that office can be reconciled with the constitutional proposals to which he has put his name. The office of Secretary of State for Scotland is not just a cipher or a cosmetic title—it depends on the very large budget that the Secretary of State has, his legislative powers and his Executive responsibility for many of the great Departments of State as they apply north of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say why that is relevant to European policy in particular as well as to domestic issues. If all those powers were removed from the Secretary of State for Scotland, Scotland's ability to have its interests fully taken into account would be destroyed. An extraordinary interview was conducted by David Frost with the hon. Member for Hamilton and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) on 20 January 1996. Sir David Frost asked whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"there really is no job anymore for a Scottish Secretary" after those constitutional proposals.</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland agreed. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that's right if the Scottish Parliament is going to be the kind of institution that I want"</p></blockquote>
there would not be any job left for the Secretary of State for Scotland. He was frank and honest about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Hamilton was asked the same question, he said:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Martin. I wonder whether you could enlighten the Committee. In view of the letter from the Chairman of Ways and Means to the usual channels, I, as the Labour Whip for the Scottish Grand Committee, came to an agreement with the Conservative Whip that opening speeches would be 20 minutes long. I appreciate that the right hon. and learned Gentleman might not be aware of that, but I did attempt to ensure that he received that information. In fairness to everyone, and in view of the letter from the Chairman of Ways and Means, I ask that members of the Committee comply with that requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Arrangements between the Whips—the usual channels—are nothing to do with the Chair. I am empowered by the rules that the House gives me; therefore, there is no limit on speeches. If such an arrangement was made, however, I am sure that the Foreign Secretary will take it into account, although the Committee will appreciate that he has given way to interventions. All I can do is appeal to members of the Committee. Back Benchers are as entitled to their say as Front Benchers, but they must understand that interventions take up the time not only of the Minister speaking but their colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements that have been made are nothing to do with me. I am in the hands of the Grand Committee. People should stick to the arrangements that have been made, but I cannot enforce that rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say, Mr. Martin, that I was not aware of those arrangements, but I am willing to take account of the spirit behind them. I have tried to be generous in giving way, but I shall of course be less so in the very short time I have before I sit down. I am making my final remark, and I do not need to detain the Committee for much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, when, for example, European policy is being determined, as it is for the intergovernmental conference, the Secretary of State for Scotland is a crucial member of that Cabinet committee. If we remove the office, or if we remove all the powers associated with it and turn it into a mere cipher, that person cannot help to ensure that Scottish interests are properly taken into account. That must be acknowledged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton talked about how the Secretary of State for Scotland would be "a channel of communication" between the Assembly and Westminster. Frankly, to be a message boy is not the destiny of the Secretary of State for Scotland. That is a disgraceful way to put it which, in any event ignores the reality of what would happen if the Assembly were of a different political majority to the Government at Westminster. It is not realistic to believe that the Secretary of State from one party can act as a message boy for an Assembly of a different political persuasion. He would carry no influence, nor would he be expected to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
When one looks at the crucial requirements in Europe, the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Livingston, which he repeated again on the radio this morning—that the Scottish Assembly would appoint a Minister for Europe—sounds grand but it is a deception on the people of Scotland. Such a person would have no executive responsibilities in the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers is a council of representatives of independent states. While such a person could no doubt be an observer, could no doubt lobby Brussels, could no doubt be heard in that capacity, so, too, can hundreds of other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by simply giving this warning to the Committee. Let us for the moment put on one side all the other arguments for and against devolution. They will no doubt be explained and developed on many occasions. But if members of the Committee believe that Scotland has been well served over the past 100 years by some very fine Secretaries of State—some Labour, some Conservative, some of varying political complexions—and if they believe that that has been a great asset for Scotland, I give this warning. To abolish that office or to so emasculate it so that the Secretary of State carries no influence would represent the greatest loss of Scottish influence and power in both Whitehall and Westminster as well as further afield in Europe than we have seen for the past 100 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the heavy price to pay. It may be a price worth paying—that is for some to argue. But do not do as the hon. Member for Hamilton does—deceive the Scottish public into believing that they can have both devolution and continue with a powerful Secretary of State. He has to make up his mind. But it is not just the hon. Gentleman that I am worried about—it is Scotland's interests, both here at home and in Europe that will suffer as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Foreign Secretary began by recalling that some 20 years ago he and I were in this very chamber. Perhaps he will forgive me for pointing out that when we last met here, he and the Minister of State, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) were in Opposition, and I and my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) were in office. This is, therefore, an excellent place in which to begin an election year. There was nothing in the Foreign Secretary's speech that is likely to avert us from ending up in those respective positions when polling day comes round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of what the Foreign Secretary said about why we cannot have devolution is that we would lose a distinguished Secretary of State from the Cabinet. I do not want to discourage him, but I gently suggest that if he goes around warning the people of Scotland that they cannot have a Scottish Parliament because they would lose the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) from the Cabinet, he may be disappointed at how little they are impressed. It is ludicrous to say that in the next Cabinet there may not be enough Scots. On present form, there will be more Scots in the next Labour Cabinet than there will be Tory Members of Parliament representing Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the right hon and learned Gentleman's historical excursion. It is certainly true that Scotland has a long, proud history of engagement with

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
the world: Scots explorers first mapped large parts of Africa; Scots missionaries gave their lives to the countries that they discovered in Africa; Scots engineers built the bridges and the docks of trading routes around the world; and Scots soldiers are buried on every continent of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty that falls to us in politics today is to determine how we should act as stewards of that inherited international legacy. It is fair to ask what David Livingstone would have made of a Government who for a decade were the friends of apartheid and who lost leadership across Africa because of their opposition to sanctions on white South Africa. What would the missionary societies across central Scotland that supported Livingstone have made of a Government who slashed overseas aid to the poorest countries in the world in repeated Budgets to pay for tax cuts for the richest people in Britain? What would Lord Kelvin or James Watt, who turned the Clyde into the engineering shipyard and shopyard of the world, have made of a Government who for the first time since the industrial revolution lost Scotland its surplus in trade and manufactured goods and left us with a deficit in engineering products?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government have neglected the international legacy of Scotland when they should have acted as its trustees. Nowhere is that neglect more clear than in their hostility to Europe—what an appropriate time to give way to the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the situation is so disastrous, how can the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that may be so, but the hon. Member must bear in mind what I said a moment ago—for every manufactured good exported from Scotland, we import more into Scotland, something that never happened from 1780 to 1982. If he wants to understand trade and export he better listen to what we are about to discuss in relation to Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look at the Tory party today I see a party consumed by a distrust of Europe that is a betrayal of Scotland's past and a threat to its future. I shall exempt the Foreign Secretary from the prejudices of his party, which he is compelled to represent, and I am prepared to breach the practice of the past two years and put in a good word for him as we meet in our home town. I remember that a long time ago in the Foreign Secretary's misspent youth, which he is no doubt anxious to keep under wraps from his colleagues, we were both officers of our university's European Society, committed to promoting better understanding and closer ties between Scotland and Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right; we were both founder members of Edinburgh university's European Society which was committed to encouraging British membership of the European Union. I have continued to believe in Britain's membership of the European Union. The right hon. Gentleman, who has been a member of that European society, changed his mind and campaigned for Britain to come out; after that he changed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
his mind again, and campaigned for Britain to stay in. He now presents himself as someone with views on Europe that the British people can trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman has to face the fact that we have been members of the European Union for more than 20 years. Rather than making the best of Britain's membership of the European Union, his Cabinet colleagues jostle on the starting grid in the race for the Tory leadership and say how little committed they are to Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at those on the Government Front Bench, I feel that compassion is the proper and decent response to the fact that the Foreign Secretary is obliged to sit next to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is so opposed to a better understanding between Scotland and Europe that last year he refused to fly the European flag. Indeed, he was so keep to let us know that he was against flying it that he announced his refusal before anyone had asked him to fly it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing is more important to Scottish industry than the fact that Scotland should make a success of our membership of the European Union. Last year, I carried out a survey of the 100 largest exporting firms in Scotland. It showed that half of those firms believe that their exports would be less secure if there were doubts about Britain's commitment to Europe. It also showed that most of the overseas-owned companies believe that their investment plans in Scotland would be less secure if there were doubts about Britain's commitment to Europe. That is why it is important that Scotland is represented by a Government who are committed to establishing a constructive relationship with Europe rather than by the present Conservative Government, who believe in being tough on Europe and tough on the causes of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. ALLAN STEWART 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>The Foreign Secretary discussed inward investment. Thank heavens that inward investment has occurred. Without it, the Government's investment record would be even more dire than it already is. Even with inward investment, they still have not got investment in Scottish industry back to the level that it reached in the 1970s.</p>
	<p>Foreign companies that set up plants in Scotland do not come here just to sell in Scotland; they come here because production in Scotland guarantees them access to any country in the European Union. I shall tell the Foreign Secretary what will make companies from Dallas or Tokyo think twice before coming here. It is not devolution; it is the debate in the Conservative party, which raises doubts about our long-term relationship with Europe.</p>
	<p>There is only one other factor that would undermine business—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman. His comment conflicts entirely with the current situation. Scotland has attracted major inward investment while the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Conservative party has been debating relations with Europe—that debate has also been going on in the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it strange that the hon. Gentleman does not apply the same argument to devolution. Inward investment plans have been made in the sure knowledge that a Labour Government and a Scottish Parliament are coming, and that has not put off companies from investing their money in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final influence that might deter those companies from investing in Scotland is the belief that Scotland could not provide a skilled, educated work force for those companies' factories. Over the recess we heard a statement from the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland claiming that Scotland faces the loss of 1,500 teaching posts across Scotland. Its president warned:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These latest cuts will affect every child in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
Running down Scotland's education system creates a far more real threat to inward investment than any apparition that the Foreign Secretary can conjure up about devolution. The solid case for devolution is the fact that the Scottish people did not want and did not vote for cuts in their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Foreign Secretary wants us to believe the paradox that if the Scots get more power for Scotland, they will have less influence in Europe. I know that the Tory party is out of touch with Europe but someone should explain to the Foreign Secretary what is going on in other European countries. Europe is evolving into a Europe of the regions. In Belgium, Spain and Italy, the trend is towards regional autonomy. Germany already has a highly developed constitution—ironically, a construction largely written for it by Britain at the end of the war. A devolved Scotland will fit better into the future pattern of Europe. A Scottish Parliament, like the German provincial Lander, would be involved in direct dialogue with the Commission. Labour's plans for a Scottish Parliament include proposals to strengthen, not weaken, Scotland's influence in Brussels. Labour's plans for devolution will create a Minister for European Affairs in a Scottish Administration, set up a Scottish European office in Brussels accountable to a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, confer on Scottish Ministers the same observer status as that of the German Lander at appropriate meetings, and will strengthen the scrutiny in Scotland of European directives, which any hon. Member who is honest must admit is a task pushed to the sidelines by the pressure of business at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compare that raft of measures to strengthen Scotland's influence in Europe with the record of a Conservative Government who refuse even to let local authorities elect their own representatives to Europe's Committee of the Regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. He really has let the cat out of the bag. The grandiose person, who will be called Scottish European Minister, will have observer status—those are not my words but his—compared with a Secretary of State for Scotland, a senior member of the Cabinet, who takes decisions and sits, as of right, in the Council of Ministers. We can either have a person with power or an observer because the Labour party offers an observer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman appears to think that I am arguing for independence. I am not arguing that Scotland should withdraw from the United Kingdom. I am not arguing against sending Members of Parliament to Westminster. I am not arguing—heaven help me if I were—that Scots should not serve in the British Cabinet. I would be in some difficulty on this Bench if I were to argue that. I am saying that, in addition, Scotland would have its own Parliament with observer status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the nationalists have a better recognition of the potential of Scotland's membership of Europe. Indeed, they are enthusiastic about being in a union with Italy, Greece or Finland. It is just being in a union with our immediate neighbours that they cannot stand. I have to say that does not stack up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the example of the single currency. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) has tried recently to pose as the champion of the Scottish banks. In the dying days of the past year, he demanded of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, under a single currency, the three Scottish clearing banks would still be able to produce their own banknotes. Unfortunately, his short term as champion of the Scottish banks was brought to an end a week later by the chief executive of his party, who revealed the SNP's new credit card, courtesy of the Beneficial Bank of America, who does not have a single branch anywhere in Scotland. It would be nice to think that, today, we will be spared lectures on how to put Scotland first from the party that puts American banks first. But, in case we get those lectures, let us consider the SNP's policy on a single currency. The SNP policy document on Europe states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We … reserve to the Scottish Parliament, after consultation with the people in a referendum, any decision to participate in a single currency."</p></blockquote>
That is a logical absurdity. The reason why a single currency has any attraction is because of the large volume of goods traded between the countries of Europe. There are no two European countries in which goods go back and forth more than between Scotland and England. Is the SNP seriously saying that an independent Parliament could take a decision different from that of the English Parliament? The reality is that the so-called independence of the SNP would reserve the decision on a single currency to the English Parliament. If England joined, Scotland would have to join. If England refused to join, Scotland would have to join.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is because the fundamental issues such as the single currency will continue to be decided at Westminster and will continue to have a profound effect on Scotland that Labour believes that it is vital to the democratic rights of the Scottish people that they continue to be represented in a British Parliament. Labour also believes that those same democratic rights demand that the Scottish people should be free to determine for themselves policies that affect only themselves. That is why Labour will give the Scottish people a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Conservative Ministers go to Brussels they like to talk about subsidiarity. I have no problem with subsidiarity. My only regret is that the Government talk about subsidianty in Brussels but will not practise that in Britain. The reason why Conservatives find the notion of devolution profoundly dangerous is that it will prevent them from ruling a nation that never voted for them and never voted for their policies. The Conservative party started the last election with the standing of a political minority. It has since dwindled in the opinion polls to the status of a cult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A delicious irony has surfaced in the past two weeks. The Conservative party, which denies the right of the Scottish people to vote on whom they want to run the Scottish Office has now come out in defence of the right of the Duke of Buccleuch to vote in the House of Lords on whatever he pleases. The Tory party has still not grasped that the affairs of the nation should be run by those with the most votes, not by those with the most acres. It is Scotland's claim of right that we should be governed by people for whom we vote. Labour will restore that democratic principle to the Government of Scotland. We will give the people of Scotland the opportunity of a Parliament in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for the Conservative party is that a political party that does not trust the people enough to share power with them will one day find that the people have decided not to trust that party with power. That day of reckoning is coming and when it arrives the Conservative party will find that the people of Scotland
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
are confident that they can make a success of Scotland and the world if they get a Parliament for Scotland. It will also find that the people of Scotland are absolutely certain that they can make a better success for Scotland and the world if they first get rid of an out-of-date, insular, arrogant and elitist Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I look forward to 3 February and to welcoming this Committee to my constituency—the royal and ancient borough of Selkirk. As members of the Committee proceed to the Victoria hall, they will pass a magnificent statue to Mungo Park who was born in a humble cottage in the Yarrow valley. He was one of the many Scottish explorers who made a great contribution to the opening up of Africa. In relation to the proportion of our population, the Scots, in terms of explorers, missionaries and engineers, made a much greater and substantial contribution to what became known as the Empire than did our colleagues south of the border.

Last week I was in Blantyre—not in Lanarkshire, but Malawi—and went to see the rough-hewn wooden crosses that pay tribute to the medical missionaries who died at the Livingstonian mission before it was transferred to a healthier place in the hills in the north of the country. There lie the remains of Dr. William Black from Fife and his colleagues who died attempting to bring education, medical care and enlightenment to the people in that part of Africa. The Foreign Secretary knows as well as I do that many African leaders today owe their education either directly or indirectly to the Scottish tradition. I cite Kenneth Kaunda, Julius Nyerere, Dr. Banda, in his earlier days, and half the present Kenya Cabinet. They were all educated at institutions founded by the Scots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we are right to be proud of Scotland's place in the world. One needs only look around the world to find places with Scottish names, such as Nova Scotia in Canada, Dunedin in New Zealand, and Mount Ettrick in the United States of America. One of my more astonishing experiences in recent years was to attend the Stone mountain games near Atlanta where I saw traders from the high streets of Edinburgh—not a stone's throw from here—selling yards and yards of tartan to the Americans, just as they do in the shops in the capital city of Scotland.

When we consider our relationship with Europe, we find the same trend. Historically, the links between the Scottish universities and the universities of Bologna and Leiden were great. There were church links with Luther and Calvin. The legal system is Roman-Dutch, not the

English common law system. We need only talk to a teenager who has hitch-hiked across Europe who will say that his success rate in getting a lift is greater when he is wearing a kilt rather than jeans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that in every aspect of life, Scotland is a deeply European country and feels as such. Our historical alliances with Europe have lived on in peculiar ways. I think that the Foreign Secretary referred to a time when Edinburgh town council had rather odd views on claret drinking. Before the Act of Union, the English were so annoyed with the French that they banned the sale of claret in England. The result was that there was a huge import of claret into Leith, and it became the Scottish national drink—a habit which some prominent members of my party maintain to this day, such as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell), who is not here, not to mention my noble Friends in the House of Lords. My constituency did very well in that period. Claret came in through Leith and my constituents did a very good trade smuggling it into the north of England. I suspect that that was the time when the campaign for the dual carriageway—the Al—first started. The claret trade did very well over Carter bar and down the road to the borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point that I am making is that Scotland has never needed to fumble over its relationship with Europe. We have felt comfortable in that relationship. The Foreign Secretary has a difficult task in the present Cabinet in trying to portray at the beginning of the recess, the morning after the Secretary of State for Health had made his post-election bid for the leadership of the Conservative party and announced that a new relationship between Britain and Europe was needed. The Foreign Secretary calmed all of us who were listening by saying that he had rung up the Health Secretary the night before to find out what he meant. That is an interesting method of Cabinet Government. The Foreign Secretary must be extremely busy. How often does he phone the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Scotland to find out what they mean on Europe? If that is how he conducts foreign policy, I am concerned about Mrs. Rifkind's reaction when she sees the Duddingston telephone bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no reason in Scotland to have any doubts about out identity as a European nation. The Foreign Secretary and the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) dealt with the question how best we should express Scottish identity in the world of today and the Europe of today. One of my more interesting experiences last year was to preside in the new Parliament building over a seminar organised by Liberal International. We heard three distinguished speakers from three countries that practise what we are now preaching. The first was the former Economics Minister of Germany, who told us about the contribution that the decentralised political constitution of Germany—which, as the right hon. Member for Livingston rightly said, we inflicted on the Germans after the war—has made to the economic health and vitality not just of Germany as a whole but of the individual component states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also heard from a member of the present Canadian Cabinet who came from Quebec. The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Foreign Secretary said that he did not know the answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), but I can tell him that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
Cabinet Minister said that, if it were not for the federal constitution, Quebec would have left Canada long ago. That is the answer to the Tory scare that a devolved Parliament in Edinburgh would lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. The reverse is true: it is the denial of our democratic rights in Scotland that could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and in many ways the most interesting speaker was the Prime Minister of the Government of Catalonia, whom I have got to know well over the years and whose Parliament in Barcelona I have visited more than once. In talking about the end of the Franco era and the recreation of demoncracy in Catalonia, with all its economic and cultural impetus, he used the phrase "non-secessionist patriotism", which to me sums up where we stand on Scottish government.

Do the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland believe that Scotland has less identity than Bavaria, Quebec or Catalonia? They have no logical argument. I remind the Foreign Secretary that I frequently quote from the distinguished speech that he made in the House as a Back Bencher when he resigned from the shadow Cabinet on the matter. He said, and I quote only one sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland is the only territory on the face of the earth which has a legal system without a legislature to improve, modernise and amend it."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 December 1976; Vol. 922, c. 1832.]</p></blockquote>
That is not a statement of opinion, it is a statement of fact, and that fact has not changed just because the right hon. and learned Gentleman has moved from being an Opposition Back Bencher to being a member of the Cabinet and running our foreign affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I made a speech on the subject to a conference in Italy. I explained the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland and how it was that, if I represented an English constituency, I could ask a question on behalf of my constituents on Monday to the Secretary of State for Health, on Tuesday to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, on Wednesday to a Minister responsible for housing, and on Thursday to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; in the following week, I could ask the Secretary of State for Transport about roads, the Home Secretary about police matters and the President of the Board of Trade about an industrial location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because I am Scottish Member, however, I have to save the questions I ask on behalf of my constituents for the one occasion in the month when the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is responsible for all those matters for my constituents, comes to the House of Commons. That is the lack of democratic accountability. It has been ameliorated to a small extent by the travelling road show that is the Scottish Grand Committee, but the fundamental issue remains that, as far as our constituents are concerned, the Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for all such matters, whereas south of the border there are individual, accountable Ministers responsible for each of those subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also explained to the conference that there is great concern in the Conservative party about the anomalies that would arise if there were a Scottish Parliament and a minority of Scottish Members of Parliament talking about or voting on English legislation at Westminster. The anomaly worries Conservatives so much that they ignore

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
the fact that if, during the Committee stage of the Flood Prevention and Land Drainage (Scotland) Bill this afternoon—it is a non-controversial matter—we decide to amend a Government proposal, they will mobilise 570 Members of Parliament from England, Wales and Northern Ireland to overturn the views of the elected representatives of Scotland. That is a far greater anomaly than anything that could be thrown up under a devolved Parliament. There has been a tartan tax in this country: the poll tax, for which we paid dearly. I say to the Secretary of State that the people of Scotland have a right to decide that they want better education, health service and social service provision than that south of the border. They also have a right to decide that they want to pay for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in these debates ignore the real history of Scotland. In fact, there has been a Scottish colony: the disastrous Darien scheme at the end of the 17th century. Scottish banks, industrialists and landowners put money into it, but it was a major economic catastrophe and cost hundreds of people their lives. Following that economic disaster, many people in Scotland decided to follow through with the logic of the union of the crowns and link politically and economically with their larger neighbour to the south. The great debate that raged then was on whether the Scottish Parliament should be extinguished or continued within the wider union. That was the real debate; the debate today between the Conservative party and the nationalists is a different, false debate, on whether we maintain the status quo or move to total separation. The people of Scotland are not interested in that. They want to know whether we in the capital of Scotland can say not only that we are proud of our history our international festival, our own church and court systems, but that we want to bring back our own Parliament. That is reasonable request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I say to the Foreign Secretary that I looked gloomy during his speech not because of its content but its lack of content. If that is his idea of dealing with the topic of Scotland in the world and of decisions for the millennium, that is extremely depressing. I hope that many people in Scotland will have noted that the Foreign Secretary adopted a negative approach instead of selling a vision for our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it would cause dismay throughout Europe if Scotland became a separate nation. I say that it is his Government who cause dismay throughout Europe, almost daily. He need speak only to our farmers and fishermen to realise how ineffective the Government have been in trying to communicate their message to the European Community. In the 18-month period to the end of 1995, there were 125 meetings of the Council and only 10 attendances registered by the Scottish Office—nearly all on issues pertaining to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. That is hardly giving Scotland a strong voice in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take lectures from the Foreign Secretary on defence issues. His Government have been responsible for the amalgamation of many of the proud regiments to which he referred, including the Gordon Highlanders and the Queen's Own Scottish Highlanders who are so vital
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
in my area. The amalgamation into an organisation called the Highlanders has left a bitter feeling in the communities that those regiments served so proudly. The Minister is also the man who preferred orders to go to Devonport not Rosyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Foreign Secretary did not answer our question—why should not Scotland be an independent nation? Why should not Scotland be in the world? We are a proud, historic, democratic country with good traditions but, like a naughty child, we are expected to be seen rather than heard. Like the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel), I have had the privilege of visiting other countries; Zimbabwe for example, a newly and proudly independent country, where I spoke about equality of opportunity for women in that society. I have also visited the Baltic states, under the auspices of the Foreign Office, at a time when they were occupied and the western world did not seem prepared to make a dynamic move to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not Scotland, as an independent nation, through its democratically elected representatives, be involved in all the communities of the world? I mean by that all the people of Scotland—and all the peoples of Scotland, because I recognise that we live in a multi-racial society; we do not allow ethnic exclusion. That is why the Foreign Secretary's talk of Balkanisation is so offensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party has a proud record of ensuring that all who live in Scotland are regarded as Scots irrespective of their origin, their belief or the colour of their skin. I want the voice of Scotland's multi-racial society to be heard in the institutions of Europe and the world. As a nation, we should stop eavesdropping; we should stop lobbying, which is what Ministers do at the Council; and we should not remain outside the conference room. We should take on the rights and the responsibilities of partnership in the international community. I cannot agree with the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) that observer status is sufficient. We must be in Europe as a full member, which can be achieved only through the clear stance that my party takes on independence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and I would dispute whether Scotland would be in surplus or deficit in respect of the funding of its economy. Can she say whether an independent Scotland under the SNP would be a net contributor to Europe, or would we take from Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that question rather strange. The hon. Gentleman has obviously not studied the economic arguments propounded by my party. With the resources that would be available to an independent Scotland, we would of course be a net contributor. At the moment, we have to achieve objective 1 status to try to remedy some of the problems of the highlands and islands, which have been so neglected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the House of Commons, the Prime Minister's consistent reply to Opposition Members is to say that they should stop running down the country. You the unionists in Scotland consistently denigrate their own country. They tell us that we are too poor or too rich, that we are too selfish or too greedy, or even too stupid. What sort of attitude is that to the people who inhabit Scotland? The unionists do not say such things about other nations equivalent in size to Scotland, which probably have fewer resources.

My hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) has already referred several times today to the Irish economy, but we should consider some of the other countries about which I am particularly concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Lady a simple question in relation to her party's policy on Europe? If Scotland was to become independent under the SNP before a single currency had been created, would there be a separate free-floating Scottish currency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks a hypothetical question. We could be in the same position as Ireland, which tied itself to sterling for a considerable time. We could then move, as Ireland did, to a separate currency and take the decision on behalf of the Scottish people after a referendum in the best interests of Scottish people. That is a logical stance and not much different from other arguments propounded elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another aspect of how Scotland and the United Kingdom have taken an extremely poor attitude to the world—the question of overseas aid. For instance, in 1995 Denmark gave 0.97 per cent. of its gross national product to overseas aid; Sweden gave 0.89 per cent; and the Netherlands gave 0.8 per cent. Those figures are in stark contrast to what the UK gave—about 0.28 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>One of the problems that we face in debating Scotland's place in the world is that our national identity has so often been allowed to slip. It is true that Scotland is recognised by its exports, and through the activities of many of the people previously referred to. However, we should remember the terminology that is so often used—Anglo-American, Anglo-Irish, Anglo-this and Anglo-that. We should also remember that the media constantly refer to national news when, in fact, they mean state news from London. The United Kingdom is not a nation; it is a state that encompasses various nations.</p>
	<p>The principle that my party and I are propounding for Scotland through the democratic process—through the ballot box—is the normality of other countries to which we have referred during our debate. I wish to end my remarks with two quotes, the first being from the Deputy Prime Minister in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on 4 December 1996, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You cannot fight for the nation's self-interest if you are not at the conference table."</p></blockquote>
I want Scotland to be at the conference table. My final quote is from the president of my party 30 years ago. In 1967, Dr. Winnie Ewing changed irrevocably the political face of Scotland. Her slogan was
	<br><blockquote><p>"Stop the world, Scotland wants to get on!"</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what we want to do.</p>
	<p>12.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State started his remarks with a grand tour of his experiences in local government, a route that others have followed. However, I do not intend to do the same. I listened with interest, however, to his remarks about history, both ancient and modern. He referred to the great period of Scottish enlightenment and to the great
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
contribution made by local government to Europe and the world. When it came to modern times, however, I fear that his grand tour was a revisionist view of history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities in Scotland, Aberdeen in particular, were most supportive of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, yet I recall the height of abuse that was thrown at them by various Conservative Governments. Furthermore, when Dundee voiced its support for the Palestinians, abuse was again heaped on it. History has now shown that the people who were prepared to stick out their necks were probably far more right than the Governments of the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened—not exactly with astonishment, but with some scepticism—to the Foreign Secretary when he referred to his giving support to Nelson Mandela for many years. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will recall that, from time to time, when he was a Minister of State at the Foreign Office, I used to meet the president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement fairly regularly. I remember one meeting that lasted about five minutes—it was the shortest meeting on record—when there was a furious dispute between Archbishop Huddleston and the Minister of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Archbishop Huddleston was arguing that the Government were actively supporting apartheid because they would not impose sanctions while the then Minister of State argued strongly that it was necessary for progress to be made in South Africa and for Mr. Mandela and the ANC to renounce violence. I recall his showing us the door, accusing Archbishop Huddleston of being a casuist. Well, given that, I think that the Secretary of State is moving much more along those lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as forgiving as President Mandela. I recall Baroness Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister, saying in the House of Commons something from which the Secretary of State has never shown any signs of distancing himself. She said that, if people thought that Mr. Mandela and the terrorist ANC would ever govern South Africa, they were living in cloud cuckoo land. Who is living in cloud cuckoo land now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I have allowed myself to be diverted by the Secretary of State, although I make no apology for putting such matters on the record. In his speech, he avoided all reference to the European Union and, in particular, the single currency. He said that we had debated such matters before and that he did not want to go over the same ground. His party is in huge disarray. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Foreign Secretary are sitting side by side; both have almost diametrically opposite views about the future of Europe, yet they try to pretend that they are going along the same lines. Back Benchers and, increasingly, members of the Cabinet voice disagreements on the future of Europe, but they ignore the fact that Europe's faults—whether real or imagined—are the direct responsibility of the Conservative Government of the past 18 years. What have the Government been doing? If they are unhappy about the rules of Europe, it must be because they have been wholly incompetent and failed to recognise the importance of the various agreements that they have reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard Back Benchers rail against the Maastricht treaty, but who signed that treaty? Even the Tory party's most negative campaigning could not attribute the signing of the Maastricht treaty to the Labour party. We hear the Prime Minister shifting in the wind.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
He now says that he wants a more flexible Europe and that he is hellbent on preventing a more federal Europe—but, of course, he says that he will wait until the Amsterdam intergovernmental meeting before he says what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why the Government are in such a mess about Europe is that in both their foreign policy, especially on Europe, and their domestic policy they have looked for the short-term quick fix. They have chosen particular talismans of economic policy and followed them slavishly, irrespective of what has happened in the real world. It has not mattered to them that manufacturing industry has collapsed almost to extinction; it has not mattered to them that unemployment has risen hugely—so long as the talisman of the day is followed, that is all that is important to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have followed financial orthodoxy, which basically says that the market and businesses know best. Whatever the Government have been told, they have applied that orthodoxy to the health service, civil service and local government. Economic gums spoke lovingly of downsizing and rightsizing—euphemisms for sacking people and cutting the work force in the name of so-called efficiency. Those policies have been driven through, despite all the evidence before our eyes that they would not work. Now, of course, those great economic gurus hold up their hands and say, "Sorry, folks; we got it wrong." However, the Government have not recognised that they got it wrong. The difficulty is that if that slavish attitude is taken on the single currency, we will suffer similar ill effects. There is ample evidence of that in foreign and development policies. The International Monetary Fund has a set of rigid financial criteria, which are imposed on countries irrespective of the damage that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite two examples, of which the Foreign Secretary will be aware. First, peace agreement has been reached in Mozambique, where civil war has raged for a couple of decades. That country needs aid money for development, but the rigid application of so-called financial probity is destroying its infrastructure far quicker than the civil war did. That is resulting in instability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in Angola not only are financial criteria applied, but the IMF, and this Government as well—are dictating how the country should be run, saying that all democratic procedures should be set aside. The fact that a party has won an election makes no difference. The minority party that lost the election is allowed to dictate how the country is run and to demand places in Government. It is a curious logic, which has never been applied in this country, that the loser should dictate how a country is governed. Again, disaster is staring people in the face because of narrow perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the single currency is used as a straitjacket to constrict what Governments do, it will fail. We have already seen the difficulties caused in Germany and France by their attempts to meet the criteria for membership of the single currency. How will the single currency operate? As far as I can tell, there will be no democratic control over it. All the railing against moves towards a federal Europe is quite wrong. My concern is not that there is a move towards a federal Europe—if there was, I could, perhaps, accept it. As the single currency is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
applied as a straitjacket, we are seeing a drive towards an unaccountable dictatorship of bureaucrats, whether in a central bank, in the Commission or in the Council of Ministers. None of those bodies is properly accountable, and there is a huge democratic deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I do not want simply to damn the single currency or other move in Europe. If the single currency is used as an engine for growth, for improving manufacturing industry and for producing employment, it is to be welcomed. Studies have been carried out over the years and I dare say that studies will be carried out as the European Union enlarges-although that will make things more difficult. The studies show that if all the countries of the European Union were to operate common economic policies for growth and to deal with the needs of the people in their countries-to deal with infrastructure and people's futures-growth in those countries would not follow a straight arithmetical line, it would be exponential. We could achieve a huge expansion that is how the matter should be approached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem at present is that I do not know-perhaps some of my hon. Friends know-what the Government are saying behind closed doors at summit meetings. I do not know to what they are signing up. The Foreign Secretary says that he is working very hard to get consensus in Europe, but the Prime Minister is continually posturing in a pseudo-nationalistic manner and saying that he is standing up for Britain. I suspect that what has happened in the past could well happen in the future-the Government talk tough in public when in fact they are signing up to agreements that would make the single currency a straitjacket on the economy of Europe. The Government have always tried to impose a straitjacket on job creation in this country's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore imperative that by the time of the Amsterdam summit, or even before, we have a Government who are intent on being positive in Europe and on making the maximum use of European institutions for the benefit of the people not only of Scotland, but of England, Wales and Northern Ireland-and, indeed, of the rest of the European Union. That can happen only when we have a new Government, so the sooner the Government pluck up enough courage to go to the country, the better. They have no reason for their existence other than their own survival. They are treating the House of Commons like a hospice for the terminally ill and are anxious only to assuage pain and alleviate distress for as long as is necessary. That is not good enough for this country. It is not good enough for our people. The sooner we have a change of Government, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) later; I want first to deal with the Liberal Democrat position, although I know that no Liberal Democrats are present. The reason why the Liberal Democrat proposals for a federal structure—they are theoretically viable—have never been introduced is that for 100 years they have been trying to sell them to people living in England. Some 83 per cent. of the voting population of the United Kingdom live in England, so there is no question that until those people accept the Liberal Democrat proposals, they will remain theoretical, however viable or otherwise they may be.

I intervened on the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) when he was complaining that we Scottish Back-Bench Members could not use the system. The reason that he cannot use the system is that he does not attend often enough—that is the truth of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). What is Labour offering? The Labour party expects to have a Scot who was educated in a fee-paying, selective Scottish school as Prime Minister. He is expected to lead a Cabinet in which major portfolios will be held by Scots representing Scottish constituencies. Those Cabinet positions will include the offices of Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Scotland—as long as that job exists. Other positions similarly held will probably include those of the Chief Whip and Patronage Secretary and, possibly, Secretary of State for Transport, while a number of posts among the Law Officers and Ministers of State will also be held by Scots. Quite rightly, the 83 per cent. of the population living in England would protest that the Scots were running Westminster. The right hon. Member for Livingston alluded to that in his remarks but, under the unitary parliamentary structure, there is nothing wrong with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), who leads the Labour party, ever becomes Prime Minister, he will tell the House of Commons that the Goschen-Barnett formula will be retained and that a Parliament will be established in Edinburgh, to be run by Scots for Scots. In my judgment, such a proposition could not be sold in England. There would be 73 Scots voting on English law and order, on the English legal and education systems, on English local government and planning, and so on. Those are all controversial matters, yet Scottish Members who come from Scotland would be unable to vote on those same matters as they affect Scotland. Indeed, English Members would be equally unable to vote on matters that are devoted to Scotland. Anyone who does not think that that is a recipe for disaster is not living in the real world. Until this proposal was tabled I had never before in my life known majority interests to be so ignored. I believe that there will be such a backlash to the proposal that no relevant Bill would get through the Westminster Parliament. If such a Bill were to get through, there would be demands for separation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the views expressed by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and the Scottish National party. It is honourable and honest to seek independence and separation from the rest of the United Kingdom if one is willing to pay the costs involved. We should make no mistake: all divorces impose costs, and costs there will be. To their great credit, a number of leading nationalists have declared that they want separation and that they wish to see Scotland go it alone, whatever the costs. That is an honourable and honest view that must be respected by its opponents, of which I am one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I doubt that it is honourable—it certainly is not honest—to claim that Scotland in Europe, as proposed by the Scottish National party, is independence. Whatever
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
it is, it is not independence. There can be no independence for Scotland under the treaty of Rome as amended by the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty. Although I could go into great detail about such matters, I do not think such a diversion would be appropriate today. Independence will not result from swapping London for Brussels. It is ludicrous to state that it will, especially when one also considers all that will follow from the social chapter and the single currency. No wonder the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) chases around trying to protect the Scottish pound note, a symbol that has no real worth or value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scots, as well as people throughout the United Kingdom, are growing more and more unhappy with the constant meddling in UK domestic law by Brussels. At such a time, the notion of Scotland in Europe must be examined in great detail. I draw the Committee's attention to recent disclosures about the lack of funded European pension schemes. There was an interesting debate about that in the House before Christmas and it is a clear example of the sort of problems that lie ahead. Does the SNP think that it is fair, wise or sensible to ask the children and grandchildren of the soldiers of the 51st Highland Division to pay for the pensions of the children and grandchildren of Hitler's Wehrmacht? That is the sort of question that must be answered. Do they believe that the transfer of fiscal and financial policy to Frankfurt is a price worth paying for their so-called independence? Do they believe that it is right that they should give up the ability to influence interest rates, rates of inflation and levels of unemployment? Those issues were addressed by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who believes that the opt-out obtained by our Government is not worth anything should consider the position we would be in if we did not have the opt-out. We would be faced with having to meet all the requirements, as the Maastricht treaty states. Does the SNP believe that the people of Scotland will accept such commitments or the need to transfer Scotland's share of the national reserves to the European central bank? The list is endless, which is why Scotland in Europe must be carefully scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall touch briefly on that lovely country, Eire. The story we get from the Scottish National party is how well that country is doing. Would not we all, including we Scots, be doing well if we were regularly getting vast sums of money from that benevolent country, the United Kingdom? That is what is happening. Eire is a net recipient of aid from European coffers. If we are to believe the nationalist figures and propaganda—I do not, but I use them as an illustration—we would be so prosperous that we would be bound to be a contributor to Europe. The nationalists would find that the small countries to which they were looking for friendship would no longer be their friends because those would be the countries getting money from Europe, while we would be paying into Europe. We would immediately be on opposite sides of the debating table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small countries think that Europe is the best thing since sliced bread. Of course it is, if one is in receipt of massive sums of money from Germany and the United Kingdom. The sad truth is that Europe today is in relative decline. Scotland, which depends on exports, cannot afford to be tied to European social costs, to which the SNP and the Labour party would tie us. Within the UK, Scotland has the prospect of escaping from European social costs.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
A UK Conservative Government will not sign up to the social cost commitments. They have made that clear and the Prime Minister has said so categorically many times, as, indeed, has my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary. The SNP and the Labour party, however, would sign up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A independent Scotland outside Europe, which many nationalists call for, would not have the European Union's social costs and being independent would involve no surrender of sovereignty. Consequently, there would be no Scotland in Europe. Such a Scotland would have all the advantages of Switzerland or Norway. The real debate would be about the costs and risks involved in the break-up of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would oppose such a move, but I would respect the honesty of those who campaigned for that sort of independent Scotland. I have no respect for those who campaign on a slogan. The people of Scotland will see through that slogan and want to protect the £60 billion of funds invested in their pension trusts. We have a duty, on behalf of pensioners, constantly to remind people of that. The people of Scotland have no wish to fund German or French pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee also that the rejection of NATO is more fundamental than the SNP appreciates or understands. The geographical position of Scotland relative to the rest of Europe and the north Atlantic is not something that we can wish away; it will remain with us. In the event of hostilities ever developing—and who can say that they will not ever develop—our geographical position will be important and NATO the deterrent that prevents us from facing such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland will reject the SNP's European bondage programme. Slick slogans are fine for soundbites, but they do not stand up to close examination. My point is quite simple, as it has been for many years: there is a simple answer to the problems of the Scots running Scottish affairs in Scotland—this Committee. The day after the Queen's Speech, a Labour Government could pass any controversial legislation that it liked through the Committee; a majority is all that they would require. The Labour party would have such a majority and it is nonsense to pretend otherwise. I made that point in the early 1970s and I am still making it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should be congratulated on drawing the attention of the people of Scotland to how effective this Committee can be. Its effectiveness, however, depends on Scottish Members being prepared to work with and use the unwritten parliamentary constitution—indeed, the finest constitution—in the world. Those who joke about it are generally those who do not use the system effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to raise an issue that I have raised before with the Foreign Secretary, in particular the eastern section of the Foreign Office. I am speaking about the enormous potential dangers that the Russian Arctic fleet poses to those who fish in Scottish waters and to the whole
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
Scottish environment. When I said that I had raised the issue before, I meant that I had warned the Department that I would raise it.

There are 207 rusting reactors around Murmansk. The area has a nightmarish list of problems, which qualify it to be the world's largest nuclear—I use the word carefully—dump. There are no dumps in the western world, but there are some in the former Soviet Union. Spent fuel was regularly disposed of straight into the sea and the amount of unsafe waste there is probably the greatest in the world. Some 70 nuclear submarines—if the Foreign Secretary disputes the numbers, I shall list them—are rusting in harbour with no proper programme for their upkeep. One of them, the Komsomlets, caught fire and sank off the Kola peninsular. Although the predicted large radiation leak has not occurred, a Soviet-vintage nuclear plant on the Litsa peninsular and several storage facilities are at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on about the danger. My question, however, is whether the Foreign Office can do anything about the situation, with the help of the Americans and Norwegians, through the Arctic Military Environmental Corporation. The countries of the former Soviet Union clearly have neither the resources nor, perhaps, the will to do much about it. Within a decade, the effects of such pollution will certainly be felt not only in the Arctic, but in European waters—not least those around Scotland. I know that that is not a mainstream issue, but it is very important and I hope that there will be a statement of policy on the matter in the wind-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment briefly on the debate. I had not intended to speak, but when I heard the Foreign Secretary refer with warm words to Nelson Mandela, I wanted to respond. As a long-standing supporter of the anti-apartheid cause, I was certain that I was right in thinking—my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) confirmed this—that the Foreign Secretary had never declared his support for the cause of the African National Congress and the struggle against apartheid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of Glasgow city council, we were the first city in Britain to give Nelson Mandela the freedom of the city. We were assaulted on all sides by Tory politicians, and not one of them said we were right to do that. They said that we would harm Glasgow's trade and industry relations, that we would hurt its economy, and that we were being grossly irresponsible in allowing Glasgow to side with what were described as terrorists. I cannot recall a single Tory politician, whether at local or national level, saying that Glasgow was right to do that, but we certainly had the support of the people of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the people of Glasgow warmly support overseas aid. As a Member of Parliament for Glasgow, I get many letters supporting overseas aid and condemning the fact that the Government have once again cut the overseas aid budget. If there is one thing to look forward to, it is an incoming Labour Government starting to restore that spending. We care about that. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear a sedentary intervention from a Tory Member. It is simply untrue that we plan to return the overseas aid budget to 1979 levels at once—that is a lie told by Conservative propagandists. It is, however, the case that Labour plans to start increasing it and to continue to increase it.

We recognise our responsibilities to the developing world—they come partly from the relationships that we have built up with those countries over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the Minister how much at the moment, but we are committed to increasing it. The Minister is laughing, but it is a deplorable thing to laugh about. He is part of a Government who have cut overseas aid rather than raise it, even by a smidgeon. They would rather cut taxes than allow people in developing countries the money to stop them being thrown into poverty. It is worse than that—people are dying because of the lack of overseas aid from wealthy countries such as ours. The Scottish people are committed to providing that aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During discussions on our plans for a Scottish Parliament, I have been asked whether a Scottish Parliament could make decisions on overseas aid. There is great concern in Scotland to ensure that we play a full part in the modern world and recognise our responsibilities as one of the rich countries of the northern hemisphere. We do not want to continue to be ashamed of what the Government do with regard to developing countries, as we would if they were re-elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk about Glasgow's place in the world. We heard the Foreign Secretary talk about the great benefits that Scotland derives from the present state of affairs and the Government's relations in the European Union. What benefits have the Government ever accorded Glasgow? Where is their investment in Glasgow? It is having its housing investment cut, the Glasgow development agency budget cut, and its Scottish Homes budget cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow developed over the centuries into a great industrial and trading city and enjoyed great prosperity during the years of the industrial revolution. I remind the Foreign Secretary that a Tory Government of 200 years ago actually provided the funds to build the Forth and Clyde canal to help industry. In those days, the private sector was unable and unwilling to provide the money, but the Government of the day stepped in and ensured that that benefit was created. They helped to create industry along its banks, especially in my constituency. Now it is derelict; we do not have those industries any more. I am still waiting to see whether the Government will produce any investment for Glasgow. They have done nothing for it so far. In fact, they are making the situation of Glasgow in the world worse than it has been for as many years as people can remember. Can the Minister explain what benefits his Government have provided in Glasgow? I shall be interested to hear about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to reply for the Opposition in what is, as the Foreign Secretary, said, a hallowed chamber. To avoid any doubt, I should say that I was asked to reply by my colleagues in the shadow Scottish Office team, not just at the last minute but last year, and, presumably, not just as the overseas development spokesman but because when speaking in this chamber I share the wonderful sense of deja vu of the Foreign Secretary, of my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), the shadow Foreign Secretary,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. McWilliam), and of the Minister of State, Scottish Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, it is significant that we had our experience of local government here is Scotland whereas the Secretary of State had his in the notorious Westminster city council—that speaks volumes for our attitude to local government. I must confess—I hope that this does not embarrass the Foreign Secretary—that I have had great respect for him since that time—not as much, of course, as I have for the shadow Foreign Secretary, but a—[HON. MEMBERS: "Where is he?"] I think that he is reading my speech outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad to say that consistency is not one of the Foreign Secretary's attributes. I, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston, recall his unqualified enthusiasm for the European ideal as a student, a councillor and a candidate. Indeed, I think that, as a candidate, he co-signed a letter with me to 	<i>The Scotsman</i> advocating a positive attitude towards Europe. He was also, as he implied earlier, a radical young lecturer at the University of Rhodesia. But, even more important in relation to what he said in the debate, he was one of the leading advocates of and campaigners for a Scottish Parliament. However—this is the sad fact—all those youthful ideals have had to be cast aside to gain and to keep office in the modern, right-wing, reactionary Tory party. That is the truth of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine what the Foreign Secretary said in a 1974 general election. I admit that he was under pressure from the ambitious active Labour candidate and his majority was substantially reduced, but he wrote to his electorate, finishing his letter with the words "Yours sincerely, Malcolm Rifkind", and said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"our commitment to a Scottish Assembly and to the establishment of a Scottish Development Fund with the revenues from North Sea Oil are fair and necessary."</p></blockquote>
In 1976 the right hon. and learned Gentleman claimed that the Conservative party had a long and honourable tradition of devolution in Scotland, and, importantly, said that it would strengthen the quality of government in Scotland, and not threaten the United Kingdom. That is what we argue. Why has he changed his mind? We have never been told—we need to know, but have never heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave way to the hon. Gentleman because this may be his last opportunity to speak in a Scottish Grand Committee—I am very sympathetic. I must tell him that the Foreign Secretary then went even further than I would have gone on Scottish devolution. He was a member of a group chaired by John P. Mackintosh. At a meeting on 20 October 1977 at Edinburgh university,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
he not only argued for a Scottish Parliament but said that such a Parliament should be elected by proportional representation. I suppose that it is sensible for someone who represents a minority party in Scotland to use that argument, yet the right hon. and learned Gentleman has never said why he changed his mind. He has been forced to retract and recant so that he can keep office in the modern Tory party. He claims now that a Scottish Parliament would destroy the Union. Why would a Scottish Parliament destroy the Union, considering that a Government White Paper is suggesting a Parliament for Northern Ireland—the most Unionist part of the United Kingdom—with no reduction in numbers at Westminster and no diminution in the power of Northern Irish Members of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few doubt the ability of the Foreign Secretary but, after hearing his record on devolution, many must now doubt his credibility. That applies equally to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will have the opportunity of replying to the debate. In 1975, he and Mr. David McLetchie—another leading light in the Scottish Conservative party—published a pamphlet entitled, "The Scottish Conservative Party—A New Model For A New Dimension".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have a copy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend like a copy? The pamphlet says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We envisage the Scottish people looking more and more to the Assembly to represent their needs and aspirations. We see the Assembly as the kernel of Scottish politics in the future".</p></blockquote>
Why change? Perhaps there is a clue in the pamphlet. What better description is there of the present state of the Conservative party and this country than the one in the pamphlet? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a climate of failure, there is a tendency to blame everyone but onself. This is as true of the Conservative party as of anyone else."</p></blockquote>
That youthful candour is strangely absent now in the Secretary of State for Scotland. I hope that we can explode the attitude and approach of both Cabinet Ministers present today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like—my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), I should like to refer to overseas development. Scotland has its own peculiar, unique approach to and structure in overseas development. We have excellent unique organisations such as the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, as well as active and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
powerful semi-autonomous branches of the main aid bodies. As the right hon. Member for Tweddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston also said, Scots have a great record of personal involvement in assisting the third world—our missionaries and explorers have included Mungo Park and David Livingstone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to put on record the recent actions of bodies such as Edinburgh Direct Aid—Christine Wincott gave her life to bring aid to Sarajevo. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) gave a personal commitment by driving a truck to Bosnia to bring aid. That is the kind of personal, individual effort that Scots put in, which is why, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said, we are particularly dismayed and disgusted at the cuts in official aid during nearly 18 years of Tory rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1979, when Labour left office, aid was 0.51 per cent. of gross national product and rising. Now, under this Tory Government, it is 0.25 per cent. of GNP and falling further under the Chancellor's recent Budget. The latest apologia heard from the Ministers responsible for overseas aid in the House of Lords and the House of Commons is that the total flow to the developing world, including private investment, is rising. That is a smokescreen—a disgraceful attempt to cover up the grim reality of the cuts. Very little of that private investment goes to Africa. I can tell Conservative Members that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said, the poorest of the poor in sub-Saharan Africa who are dying see nothing of that private investment. Their grinding poverty is unaffected by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Nations target refers to Government aid—we cannot abandon it to the voluntary and private sectors. The Government want to do with overseas aid what they want to do with care of the elderly in Scotland—abandon it to the private and voluntary sectors. That is not the way of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has its own education system. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) and I are going to meet development bodies later today to discuss ways in which we can expand and develop education in the Scottish school curriculum when Labour comes to power after the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to hear the Secretary of State for Scotland answer the many attacks that have been made on Government policy in our debate today. However, I know that my right hon. and hon. Friends are enjoying hearing those criticisms. Both the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland abandoned their youthful ideals in the quest for office. The Foreign Secretary knows that I have not changed my views on Europe, devolution or other relevant issues. There was a time when their views were surprisingly close to those of the Scottish people, but they have now cynically shifted and should not therefore be surprised that their vote in opinion polls in Scotland barely reaches double figures: they are even less popular than Prince Charles in current opinion polls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland now appears to believe that a few gimmicks—the so-called return of the Stone of Scone, and the blatant pork barrelling in marginal constituencies for which Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is notorious—will help the Tories cling on to power. Those gimmicks and gerrymandering are no substitute for the real devolution of power to the people of Scotland.

As we have seen in Bavaria, Catalonia, Canada and the United States, once the current master in No. 10 Downing street has the courage to call a general election, we shall see the current holders of power thrown from office. The people of Europe and those of the developing world will be as glad as the people of Scotland about that. Scotland and the United Kingdom will once again play a positive role in Europe and in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me begin by making it clear to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) that neither my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary nor myself has abandoned either ideals or youth. I would also like to tell him that I would be delighted to have a copy of the pamphlet to which he referred. If he were to read it carefully, he would find that my right hon. and learned Friend and I did indeed once advocate an Assembly for Scotland—but it was an Assembly with no executive powers and one that would never levy a tartan tax on the Scottish people. It is the Labour party that abandoned its views. Only a year ago, Opposition Members were saying that a Parliament without tax-raising powers would have no credibility—until they received their orders from Islington and had to introduce a second referendum question to adjust policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial point of my right hon. and learned Friend's splendid address to the Committee this morning was that the price of a Scottish Parliament with tax-raising powers would be the loss of the office of Secretary of State for Scotland because the Opposition want a Scottish Parliament to have executive powers. That is the crucial difference. We could not find the answer to the West Lothian question because we could not say how we could have an Assembly in Edinburgh and still retain power and influence over our Budget. That is why we desisted from that policy and explained clearly and fairly to the Scottish people why it was not the right course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The failure of the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) to answer the questions that were put to him by my right hon. and learned Friend should be noted by every Scottish person. A tax-raising Parliament will mean 15 per cent. more tax on Scottish pay packets, and Scottish pensioners will have to pay more. Above all, a heavy price will have to be paid regarding the funding of Scottish services and our ability to have influence in Westminster, Brussels and the councils of the world. I regret to say that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley did not address that central argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not waste the Committee's time by quoting remarks that the right hon. Member for Livingston made when he was anti-European and an anti-devolutionist, nor shall I return to the events of 1974. He boasted that if a Labour Government were elected—perish the thought—many Scots would hold key jobs in the Cabinet. However, in February 1992, when he was the shadow spokesman on health, he said, on "On the Record":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Once we have a Scottish Parliament handling health affairs, it is not possible for me to continue as a Minister of Health, administering health in England."</p></blockquote>
Presumably, that is why he was so keen to become the shadow Foreign Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman advanced the absurd proposition that some Scottish Members of Parliament at Westminster would serve in a Government whose role
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
would be to decide what was good for England but who would have no say on health, education, housing or any other matter that was raised in surgeries by our constituents. Scottish Members at Westminster will be reduced to second-class status; they will have no influence over their constituents' affairs except in respect of foreign affairs and defence. Contrary to the assertion of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), the constitutional convention specifically excluded overseas aid from the remit of a Scottish Parliament. She may wish to read that flexible blueprint again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I said that people believe that that is a possibility, but I am perfectly aware that it was not part of the plans for a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed; neither was there a plan to have a referendum on a tartan tax, so the hon. Lady should take heart in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Livingston told us about the great days of Glasgow when it had big engineering shipyards. However, the biggest single transfer of power from Scotland to London occurred when he and his cronies were in power nationalising firms and moving decision-making to a central bureaucracy in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman told us that business success depended on a commitment to Europe. That is undoubtedly true. We want to be in Europe, but we do not want to be run by Europe. That is the difference between the views of Conservative Members and those of the right hon. Gentleman. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] He says that we want to have our cake and eat it, but he is the one who wishes to have his cake and eat it. Opposition Members want to have influence at Westminster, 30 per cent. more funding than in England and a tartan tax-raising Parliament in Edinburgh. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) pointed out, that is simply unsustainable and unattainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that we had to be in Europe for business success. The key question is about the kind of Europe that will guarantee the success of Scottish business. It is not the Europe of a federalist agenda, which has been pursued by Liberal Democrats and, it seems, by the Labour party. They are content to reduce Scotland to the status of a region in a Europe of regions. That is the difference between the Opposition's proposals and the vision that my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary set out in his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Europe that is good for business will not include the social chapter or involve the statutory imposition of costs on business, which destroys competitiveness. We need only look to modern-day Germany to see that—unemployment there has reached levels that have not been seen since the Weimar republic. Britain, under the Government's policies, has become the job-creation machine of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that devolution did not deter companies from investing in Scotland. However, his colleague the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) argued that even talking about the tartan tax would be a disadvantage to Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers from a sedentary position to dishonest propaganda. Either the Labour party will campaign for a yes-vote for a tartan tax or it will not, and my understanding is that it will. By doing so, it will disadvantage Scotland and it will enunciate the principle that it is right for Scotland's pensioners and workers to pay more income tax than people in England. There is nothing dishonest about that: it is fair and square, but it is a pity that the right hon. Member for Livingston is not prepared to stand up and defend the policy that was imposed on him by his leader from Islington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Secretary of State realise that he is becoming an embarrassment to Scotland? There has been a constant propaganda barrage claiming that the relevant power is a tax. The Scottish people will decide whether a Scottish Parliament will have the relevant power and whether it will use it. To suggest that there will automatically be taxation and tax increases is a distortion, a disservice to democracy and to the Secretary of State's party and a grave disservice to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about people who are an embarrassment, why does he have more substitutes than even the FIFA rules allow? The hon. Gentleman can come and put his case to the Committee, but he has been conspicuous by his absence. How can he say that it is just a power which would not be used while at the same time telling people we are complaining about local government expenditure that his party will see them right, without giving a specific commitment? How can he do that without raising the tartan tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said that we will give extra money to health over the above inflation. We have given local government a fair settlement. The hon. Gentleman has not promised a penny, and he cannot do so unless he uses the tartan tax. Until he was told what to do by Islington he was committed to the tartan tax as a matter of principle. He said that a Parliament without a tax-raising power would not be credible. The truth is that if he gets a tartan tax-raising Parliament, the Scottish people will not pay just 3p extra in income tax. How can the party that is against capping local government be in favour of capping a Scottish Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Livingston let the cat out of the bag when he announced that we were going to have a Minister for Europe in Scotland with observer status. The Secretary of State for Scotland is the Minister in Europe on any subject that concerns the people of Scotland except when the Secretary of State for Scotland or Ministers from the Scottish Office go to a Council of Ministers meeting and speak for the United Kingdom as a whole. We have the ability in that role to influence affairs and policy in Europe. The right hon. Gentleman's Minister for Europe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The right hon. Gentleman's Minister for Europe with observer status would sit on the sidelines. He would not be part of the procedure within the Council of Ministers. What is the answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) that the right hon. Gentleman twice refused to answer? If a Labour Administration in Edinburgh sent a Labour Minister for Europe with observer status to a Council of Ministers meeting and a Conservative Government were in power, what would happen if there were a conflict of policy? The Conservative Minister would speak for the United Kingdom because our membership is as a united kingdom. Scotland would be marginalised. At least under our system Scottish Ministers are able to attend meetings. If a Minister from another Department attends, the Government's line has been agreed collectively in Cabinet where the Scottish Secretary of State has a say. The right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that many hon. Members have asked to speak. We have only another hour's debate, so those who are called must be brief to allow other hon. Members to take part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the Flood Prevention and Land Drainage (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
Copies of the Bill and other relevant documents have been made available in the Members' room, although I see that the Committee Clerk has also made them available in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following major flooding incidents in a number of different parts of Scotland in recent years, the Government decided to review legislation and responsibilities for flood prevention. My colleagues and I have visited a number of affected areas and witnessed at first hand the misery that flooding causes to its victims. I should say at the outset that our intention in reviewing legislation was to help those victims and to do all we could to help prevent such misery occurring again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations from and met delegations accompanied by the hon. Members for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster), for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) and for Strathkelvin and Bearden (Mr. Galbraith). Indeed, I shall be meeting a delegation from East Ayrshire council tomorrow, led by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, to hear the up-to-date position. We advised all those who made representations that we were committed to bringing forward proposals to help prevent flooding and the Bill that the Government have laid before the House honours that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go any further, it may help if I outline the current legislative position. The Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 provides permissive powers to local authorities to prevent or mitigate flooding of non-agricultural land. This means that councils are able to cleanse, repair and otherwise maintain any watercourse or flood defence. They are also able to improve, remove or construct channels and flood defences. Where a council proposes to construct new flood prevention works, the 1961 Act provides that it must prepare and advertise a flood prevention scheme, and submit it to the Secretary of State for confirmation. Objections made to such schemes, and not withdrawn, must be put to a public local inquiry. Following that, the Secretary of State may confirm the scheme, with or without modification, or refuse to confirm the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are designed to allow the interests of all relevant parties to be taken into account. Approved expenditure by councils on confirmed flood prevention schemes is eligible for grant from the Scottish Office at a rate of 50 per cent. The Government also announced recently that, from 1997–98 onwards, the challenge fund would be used to distribute part of councils' capital allocation covering, among other things, large flood prevention schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
I hope that councils will respond positively to this initiative and take the opportunity to compete for some of the £100 million that the Government have set aside for the challenge fund over the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who will be responsible for the costs of the survey work, which may be significant? Will that responsibility reside with councils, or will the Scottish Office help with the costs of surveying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I intend to cover that a little later in my remarks, which I shall try to keep as brief as possible, bearing in mind the length of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing legislation is permissive: councils are able to undertake flood prevention measures, but there is no statutory requirement for them to protect local citizens from flooding. Against that background, and following the flooding incidents to which I referred earlier, there was increased pressure for further measures to be introduced. That pressure was quite understandable. In my opinion, and in the opinion of those most affected by flooding, a number of local authorities had, quite simply, not done enough to prevent floods damaging people's homes and businesses. The Government, therefore, instigated a public consultation on the options for change. The Scottish Office issued a paper entitled "Flood Prevention: Review of Responsibilities and Legislation" in February 1996. It elicited a wide range of responses from a large number of interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We gave very careful consideration to the views expressed by those consulted, and to the options available to us. Following this, and in line with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's recent initiative to encourage wider public debate on proposed Scottish legislation, the Government published a draft Bill in September of last year and invited further comment. Most of the comments on the draft Bill had already been made as part of the earlier consultation and did not impact on the principle of the Bill, which is, of course, the subject of today's debate. I am sure that the Committee will take this opportunity for thorough consideration of the principle underpinning the provisions in the Bill. I hope also that the Committee will reach agreement on what is required and accept that the Bill is a genuine attempt by the Government to address a very real but complex issue. When the Bill reaches Standing Committee, and following the discussions to which I referred earlier, I intend to table Government amendments to give effect to some of the useful and constructive points that have been made during the consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that it will take more than legislation to stop flooding? He seems to be suggesting that local authorities are reluctant to exercise the powers that they have under existing legislation to undertake work to protect areas such as Haddington, Paisley and other towns that are subject to flooding. Legislation will not do; resources will be required. Is the Scottish Office offering any extra resources to go with the requirements that the legislation will impose on local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in answer to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), I intend to cover that later. I have referred to the challenge fund for capital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
expenditure, which enables local authorities to put forward larger projects, particularly those that are spread over more than one year, for submission in the challenge process. The current challenge fund is open to applications up to 17 January and I know that several local authorities have the design work for flood prevention schemes under way. I hope that they will seriously consider putting forward applications to the challenge fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the provisions in the Bill. We propose to place limited duties on local authorities to undertake certain flood prevention activities. The Bill proposes three new duties for councils: first, to survey watercourses in their areas to find out whether they are likely to cause flooding of non-agricultural land; secondly, to exercise their existing power to maintain water courses which appear to be likely to cause flooding when exercising that power would substantially reduce the likelihood of such flooding; thirdly, to prepare and publish reports of the measures that they have taken and the measures that they think that they should take to prevent such flooding—such reports to specify all occurrences of such flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will of course be a cost associated with those new duties and I acknowledge that today. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has acknowledged that in accepting the Bill's provisions as a new burden on Scottish local authority expenditure in 1997–98. The exact extent of that new burden is difficult to predict. The House has yet to debate the money resolution that will seek to authorise expenditure attributable to the Bill. I shall explain then that providing a precise estimate of the likely level of expenditure is difficult due to a number of factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to spend further time on that issue at this stage other than to advise the Committee that the local government finance settlement which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 26 November took account of those new duties and recognised an additional burden of £3 million for flood prevention activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more important is that we set the additional cost against the cost of doing nothing. Flooding in recent years in Perth, Paisley, Kilmarnock, Irvine and Kirkintilloch has caused damage amounting to many millions of pounds. There is no doubt that flood prevention schemes are required in some areas and I have already outlined the procedures for promoting such schemes and their funding arrangements. I am happy to repeat the encouragement that I have given to councils to bid for a share of the challenge funding available for capital projects. That is in addition to the formula allocation given to each council for non-housing capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also in no doubt that the provisions in the Bill, while relatively modest, will go a long way to help to alleviate flooding. By surveying the watercourses in their areas for the likelihood of flooding, by taking prompt action to remove debris, and by undertaking general maintenance and repair work, councils will reduce flooding risk. That in turn will reduce the costs associated with flood damage. Such cost are a large drain on the finances of the public and private sectors, as well as the individuals affected. By spending relatively modest sums through the execution of the new duties, which are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
preventive in nature, councils will help to preclude the need to spend much larger sums in dealing with the effect of flooding after the event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all very well, but I repeat the question. Who will pay for the surveying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to that and I have referred to the new burden of carrying out flood prevention activities, surveying being part of that. That is a burden that we recognised in the 1997–98 local government settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before drawing to a close my short speech, I would like briefly to refer to a separate provision in the Bill. The main provisions focus on the role and responsibilities of local authorities in respect of flood control and prevention measures. We have, however, taken the opportunity to include a clause—clause 5—to repeal the Secretary of State's statutory responsibility to maintain 13 agricultural drainage schemes created under the Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts of 1930 and 1941. Repeal of that statutory responsibility has long been a policy objective of Scottish Office Ministers. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) would have been aware of that when he was a Scottish Office Minister. The Bill is a suitable legislative vehicle to remove those archaic and anomalous obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that I have written to him several times regarding the areas of Crosslie and Pinetrees, where the river floods constantly. One of the big problems is that the district council is responsible for financing the survey. At present, it receives an interim loan of about £50,000 but it would need about £250,000 to do a proper survey. Is the Minister telling us that that money will be made available and that council tax payers will not be liable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that we have recognised a new burden in flood prevention activity. As in all matters, it is up to individual councils to set their own priorities in how they spend resources allocated to them. In areas where flooding is a high priority, councils have used their funds to good effect to draw up flood prevention measures. In Perth and Kinross, for example, much work has been done in trying to draw up proposals to prevent future flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun invited me to his constituency in 1995 to see the damaging effects of flooding on people's houses. His district council had taken some action towards drawing up proposals to see what needed to be done. Some measures could be quite simple, such as clearing drains or culverts. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun objected to Strathclyde region's unwillingness to join his district council in drawing up such proposals. I suspect that we shall cover those points more fully when we reach the Committee stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee because I know that many people wish to contribute to the debate. We are talking about the principle of the Bill, which will put a duty on local authorities to carry out the measures. I now want to move on to the other provisions in the Bill, to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
allow other members of the Committee to make their contributions. If other matters are raised, I shall try to address them in my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about clause 5 and the Secretary of State's statutory responsibilities to maintain 13 drainage schemes created under the 1930 and 1941 Acts. They stick out like the proverbial sore thumbs against the evolution of modern agricultural conservation policies. Less than 0.1 per cent. of Scotland's agricultural land benefits from the statutory drainage schemes and by no means all of the land that benefits from maintenance work is still in agricultural use. The river lengths treated under the 13 schemes total less than 200 km, compared with a total of 50,300 km of surveyed rivers in Scotland—around 0.4 per cent. We spend about £120,000 per annum on maintenance works, but because of the legal constraints, we are able to recover less than £2,000 per annum from the beneficiaries of those works. Similarly, the individual statutes governing the 13 schemes place constraints on the extent and scale of work which we are able to carry out, thus we are unable to move with the times and take account of, for example, conservation priorities or upstream developments such as forestry or road projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted widely about our proposals to repeal the relevant provisions in the 1930 and 1941 Acts. I have some sympathy for those landowners who will have to take responsibility for maintaining river channels and floodbanks on their land, which have been funded for many years from the public purse. That said, what we are proposing in clause 5 does no more than place those landowners on the same footing as their counterparts throughout Scotland who have not enjoyed the benefits of taxpayer-funded maintenance. Clause 5 will bring about this level playing field, and it will remove archaic and anachronistic responsibilities placed on the Secretary of State by legislation which has no place in terms of modern agricultural and conservation policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined the Government's strategy to help prevent or mitigate flooding damage. The proposals before the Committee, alongside the other measures that we have already taken, provide a comprehensive and cohesive approach to tackling the problems that have been identified. I assure the Committee that we have listened carefully to all the arguments and representations of the various interested parties. Right hon. and hon. Members will have further opportunities to raise specific issues as the Bill goes through its various parliamentary stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bottom line is that some councils have not done enough in the past to prevent flooding and too many people have suffered hardship as a result. I am pleased to say that since unitary authorities were introduced last year, there are signs that matters are improving. We want to consolidate and build on that improvement. The Bill will achieve that objective and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief; it is a short debate and many of my hon. Friends whose constituencies have been affected will wish to take part. First, however, I wish to apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster), who would have been replying to the debate and whose constituency was badly affected by floods. He is ill today and cannot be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
We welcome the Bill in principle and are glad that the powers given in the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 are to become duties. However, we have some worries, which I shall mention as briefly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of our anxieties about funding were mentioned by my hon. Friends. In the financial memorandum to the Bill, the Government say that it is possible that increased expenditure may be required. That seems very probable, but it is no good saying that the expenditure will be offset in the longer term. It is money now, and we all know how badly local authorities are affected by cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister repeated earlier the fiction that local authorities would receive more money in grant next year, but they will actually receive less. He said that £3 million would be available for the new burdens of flood prevention—presumably, in relation to surveying, cleansing and maintaining—but that should be put in the context of the overall cuts. It will still be difficult for councils to fund that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the prevention schemes of clause 3, we are talking about much larger sums that will have to come from the capital budget, which has been cut this year by £68 million. That will not be made up by challenge funding. Some councils have put in a bid for challenge funding for further prevention schemes; for example, Perth has done so and I hope that its application is successful. However, we know that not all flood prevention schemes will be funded in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, rivers should be considered as whole catchment areas. We are anxious that there should be a holistic approach to the problem, to take account of the wider ecology and of a scheme's effects downstream. I am told that the Perth scheme has tried that, and I hope that it will be successful. We must ensure that something done at one point on a river will not affect another part of the river. Co-ordination will be needed between the various local authorities; the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency may possibly also have a role to play. We hope to raise those matters in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification on some parts of the Bill. Clause 1 is about surveying, but exactly what is involved? Some people have expressed concern that that might include detailed and technical procedures. Is that what the Government have in mind, or do they mean something more general such as assessment? Do the Government have it in mind that all councils should survey all water courses, or only those with a known history of flooding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 2, the Government seem to put the responsibility on councils to do work in relation to all water courses. Will private riparian owners or occupiers have no responsibility under that chain? They presently have such responsibilities. Will all non-agricultural land now be the responsibility of the council? Can the Minister say why the suggestions at paragraph 18 of the consultation document about cost recovery and emergency access powers have not been included in the Bill? Even if councils have to do all the work, they should in certain cases be able to recover their expenses from private owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 is ambiguous. Do councils have to make reports for that which they consider necessary—the word "consider" is used in new section 6A(1)—or do they have to prepare reports for all eventualities? The ambiguity is about what they have to report on. Is it only the work that they consider necessary, or is it everything that could be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
done to avoid the possibility of flooding? I have already mentioned the major flaw in the Bill, which is that reports in themselves do not solve the problem. The provisions of clause 3 for flood prevention schemes are our main concern. I have already referred to the Perth scheme, but other councils also have schemes that simply cannot be funded given the present cuts in the capital budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been brief and have spoken quickly because I know that my hon. Friends also want to speak. We shall raise other matters in Committee. For example, we feel that there may be a case for tightening the laws on dumping, so that they are not just byelaws and so that there are stiffer penalties. However, we shall raise that, and many other points, in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am in the Committee's hands, but it would seem unfair if hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The matter is very important in my constituency, and I wanted to speak on it at some length, but I shall have to curtail my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I support the principle of the Bill, except for the provisions of clause 5, to which there is overwhelming opposition in my constituency. I have here 97 letters that I have collected during the past month or so from concerned constituents, from the National Farmers Union for Scotland and from district councils, community councils and others, who are very worried about what will happen on the repeal proposed in clause 5. That will have a dramatic effect on Annandale and Eskdale, and on 11 other constituents in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern that there has not been sufficient consultation. The earlier paper dealt with urban flooding, about which hon. Members were obviously especially concerned, and the draft Bill issued in September involved a very quick consultation. There was just a small reference in the Minister's press release, which said that in addition.
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are proposals to terminate the Secretary of State's responsibility for statutory drainage schemes."</p></blockquote>
I shall briefly rehearse the problem. There is an anomaly in the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act 1930 and the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act 1941, which make special provision for drainage in certain areas in Scotland, in particular around the Rivers Annan and Nith. I accept that it is difficult to sustain that provision in perpetuity, but we must take more time to discuss the problems that have become apparent and to decide how to deal with the situation and to prevent the flooding, about which so many of my constituents are concerned. The whole scheme costs about £120,000 a year in Scotland, about £50,000 of which is spent in my constituency, and I am concerned that that money should disappear as quickly as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
is proposed—on 1 April this year. I have attended public meetings and, as I say, I have received a flood of letters. There is a specific difference in the provision for the Nith and the Annan in the Acts—they are covered for flood banks and prevention, whereas the provision in the rest of Scotland is more for cleaning out water courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had discussions with the Minister, with the Secretary of State and with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and I have told them that we need more time to resolve certain issues. Who will be liable for future flooding? The exchange of letters between the Government, the Scottish Landowners Federation and myself leaves a great deal of doubt about who will be responsible. That must be resolved before the Bill reaches Committee. My constituents are still concerned about that liability, because big areas are involved, such as that of the Priestdykes Creamery—if that were flooded, heaven knows how much a landowner might be liable for in insurance or damages, now that people go to law at the drop of a hat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system in Annandale operates by flap valves, which are very expensive to install—I am told that, with their concrete foundations, they cost £25,000. That is the kind of responsibility that we are asking people to take on at very short notice. The whole level of Castle loch at Lochmaben, which is a most important area of special scientific interest, is protected by flap valves, and we certainly do not want Scottish Natural Heritage to run into trouble with its principal SSI. There is much flash flooding because of the development of the M6, which will now have eight lanes that will, with the subsidiary road, all drain at speed into the River Annan. The change in forestry also makes flash flooding more likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I must curtail what I want to say, but I ask the Minister three questions. First, will he postpone the introduction of clause 5 for three years, until April 2000, while all the problems are solved? Secondly, may we have a scheme whereby the Secretary of State recovers reasonable costs from all the riparian owners who are quite happy to pay something approaching cost price today, geared to the retail price index under the 1941 Act? Thirdly, will the Government make a categorial statement about liability? I want those important matters to be resolved before Committee stage. Failing that, I shall have to table amendments along those lines. I cannot take the matter lightly; it is a serious imposition on my constituency, and we must have time to resolve the problems that could cause serious flooding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as I can because, as the Minister said, I shall have the opportunity to lead a delegation to consider in depth the matter of flooding in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun district. I pay tribute to the Minister who, during the winter of 1995, responded to calls for help by coming directly to my constituency to see for himself the agony of those people, especially in Fairyhill road, who had been flooded out the year before; they had completely refurbished their houses, only to find flooding creating havoc again. Further up the river, in the Crookedholm area, there was also persistent flooding. Large agricultural areas in my constituency are flooded almost every winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill and its aims, but the difficulty over financing is the nub of the matter. We shall explain in detail tomorrow the difficulties that apply in Kilmarnock
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
to the Minister. When he visited my constituency, no survey had been undertaken that would deal with the former council's policy of sustained neglect. Nothing had been done in the Kilmarnock area for more than three years, which was partly the reason for the two floods. The Minister and I worked together to concentrate minds and, lo and behold, the survey that had been promised for three years was carried out almost immediately. It cost £60,000, which was borne three ways—by Enterprise Ayrshire, and Kilmarnock and Loudoun district council and the former Strathclyde regional council. The completed survey showed that we need about £6 million for corrective work to prevent the flooding of the whole of the Kilmarnock and Loudoun district—a region of some 200 square miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members have said, we should consider river flow and flooding areas not only in our own constituencies but in all surrounding areas, which requires much more consultation. It will cost £6 million over three years to assist in the repair of flood damage in Kilmarnock, but even if the money were available and the damage repaired, the maintenance costs over those three years would be in excess of £50,000 per annum, although I am not sure of the exact figure. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that 50 per cent. of that money would be available, as the councils are strapped for cash and would find it impossible to make up the amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How was the £3 million that has already been given divided? It was thrown into the pot, but who decides who receives what? Will someone say, "You'll get so much for flood prevention because you get flooding, you'll get some because you may get flooding and you'll get some even though you have never had any flooding?" We cannot accept that that £3 million was ring-fenced for flooding. The money has disappeared into a huge black hole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must determine where flooding might take place and the remedial work that might be required, and cash must be made available to the councils involved, not on a 50:50 basis but under a grant to complete the necessary work quickly. Furthermore, councils must receive reasonable finances to maintain those works to ensure that flooding is prevented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say much more but, on this occasion, I find myself agreeing with the remarks of right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who said that this problem is much bigger than some people imagine or than the Government are prepared to admit. Therefore, we must carefully consider how much money will be spent on proper measures to prevent what is a tragedy for anyone involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this Bill. In fact, I look on it with a wry smile, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) and I spent a couple of years trying to introduce a similar measure in various forms—such as a private Member's Bill and as part of the Environment Act 1995, under which the Scottish Environment Protection Agency was established—only to be told that it was unnecessary. However, the Government have now published the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1995 floods in my constituency, 271 houses were evacuated, 400 jobs were lost, major industry was threatened, and £4.2 million damage was done, so the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
is relevant to the area in which I live. There is no doubt that the measures in the Bill will go some way to improving the position, not so much in my constituency where the local authority is making great strides to prevent flooding, but in other areas that might be flooded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main problem that my local council faces is money. I shall not rehearse all the arguments, but I should like the Minister to ensure that he answers the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey). Was the £3 million from the Government distributed throughout Scotland or just in those areas with problems with flooding? If the money went to areas without problems with flooding, it was simply wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the comments of the right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) on the 1930 and 1941 Acts. In the fullness of time, it will be appropriate to repeal those Acts, the first of which Tom Johnston introduced after some flooding in my constituency. Those Acts belong in the past, but they cannot be changed on 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not yet clear what relationship the riparian owner has to flood prevention. It is all very well to talk about flood prevention in agricultural upland areas but, in my area, the River Kelvin floods a large agricultural area before reaching houses in an urban area. Does the responsibility for dealing with those problems lie with the riparian owner whose fields are flooded or with the local authority where the houses are? Such matters have not been thought through. The right hon. Member for Dumfries said that if they were not thought through before the Committee stage, he would table amendments; I shall support them and might even table some myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that caveat, the Bill is welcome and introduces many overdue changes; I am only sorry that it has taken my hon Friend the Member for Paisley, South and I two years to get it onto the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate on the immediate concerns of a community that has experience of what the Government purport the Bill will address. Without proper flood defence many of my constituents will continue to have problems insuring their homes as well as fearing that they might be flooded again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is nothing more than a Government exercise in buck passing. It places certain duties on local councils, but there is no extra money to help them carry out those duties, much less build the required defences. The Bill will only mean more surveys and reports; it represents no real action to protect citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the planning work has already been done in Perth and Kinross. Perth and Kinross council does not need an Act of Parliament to tell it to carry our surveys, maintain watercourses or prepare and publish reports. The people of Perth need the money to ensure that the findings of all the reports can be implemented. Perth was devastated by the floods in 1993 and huge capital expenditure is needed to prevent that happening again. A scheme exists, but £22 million—three times the council's annual capital allocation—is needed to implement it. The Government have continually failed to reassure the people of Perth that they will make the money available; instead, council officials have to invest time, money and effort in preparing a bid for challenge funding, which is a kind of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
Tory tombola. Instead of the Government guaranteeing funding, as they would in any civilised country, Perth has to compete for a share of a limited pot. There are bound to be other bids; Dumfries and Renfrewshire, for example, also need the cash. Flood scheme will be competing against flood scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flood schemes will also compete against bids for many other diverse projects throughout the country. That is nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My immediate concern is to ensure the protection of communities, particularly those in my constituency who live under the threat of further flooding. But environmental organisations raise important concerns—also raised by hon. Members—about an approach to flood defence that would help prevent flooding in areas of built development while maintaining a floodplain habitat. If that is to work, an independent regulatory body is needed to oversee flood defence work and to take a strategic overview. We could examine the role of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, building on its remit of advising on flood risk in that regard. The Bill takes no account of the long-term view, which is a serious omission. That is for the future, however, and I urge Ministers to address now the issues raised by several hon. Members on the funding of flood defences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that all hon. Members will talk in the same vein. The Opposition's main concern is that of the financial implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994, we in Paisley had some horrendous flooding which put 700 families out of their homes, some for more than a year. The then Secretary of State visited us on that occasion. People do not need to know that the Opposition welcome the Bill—although Opposition Members do welcome it, having fought long and hard for it, particularly my hon. Friends the Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) and for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster), who would be present if he did not have severe flu—or that the Government will declare who is responsible for the situation; they need to know that they will be safe in their homes and that the measures are effective so that they need not worry about the situation recurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South, some of whom are present today, have experienced the problem time and again. It is not a one-off situation for them. They have been put out of their homes many times and feel lucky when the water comes up merely to their ankles; in 1994, the water came up to the second storey of their houses. Those people need to know that the Government are not passing the buck from central to local government without providing matching funding. It is not sufficient to say that people can apply to the challenge fund, which, as the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) said, is little more than a lottery: if one's name gets pulled out of a hat, one gets funding. People need to know that there will be funding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
and where the funding is coming from; not that local authorities will just be told that they are responsible for dealing with the problem without being given the matching cash. They need to know that measures will be separately funded, so that when another flood occurs, the Government cannot say that the authority received funding in the last financial estimate and if it was used to re-roof a school or to buy school books, for example, then tough luck. The funding must be separate and specific and people must know that it will be available when the need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As many hon. Members will remember, in 1995 my constituents in Linwood, Crosslie, Lochwinnoch and Kilbarchan were flooded; they are still suffering from the effects. I remind the Minister that I spoke in the Scottish Grand Committee in Glasgow when the issue of flooding was raised, yet the Government have waited two years to introduce a Bill on it. A constituent of mine, Mr. Beveridge, who has now retired, lives in the Pinetrees area of Crosslie; each time that it rains, he cannot sleep because he keeps imagining that his house will be flooded. It has not only been flood water that has overrun his house, but sewage. His house was full of the unmentionable and, two years later, he cannot sleep when it rains. It is a godsend that his house has not been flooded again, given the times that the river has nearly burst its banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Government have taken so long in dealing with the matter. I have written to them on several occasions and have raised the matter on the Floor of the House. I have asked the Government to introduce such a Bill and I am delighted that they have done so today. However, the onus to provide all the money to solve the problem has been put on the district council. I do not know whether they can provide all the money. Who provides the billions of pounds that are spent on flood prevention in the Thames area of London? Are council tax payers expected to provide the money? Under the Bill, the vast sums of money that are to be provided to tackle such problems will be the responsibility of district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a wee smile on his face, but I shall explain the exact position to him. A developer, Taylor Woodrow, come up with proposals to build houses in Crosslie. The district council said that the area flooded all the time and that it has done from time immemorial. All local people know that and the district council objected strenuously to the proposal. The matter went before the Secretary of State's reporter inquiry; the district council was overruled and the houses were allowed to be built. Now the area is affected by floods, just as the council said would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the inadequate inquiry of the reporter, people who bought their houses in good faith do not know whether their homes will be washed into the river. Pinetrees is the problem of the Secretary of State; he must fix it now or houses will be washed down the River Clyde. Ordinary men and women should not be treated in that way; they were encouraged by the Government to speculate, obtain mortgages and to buy houses. I plead with the Minister. I have written to him repeatedly about Pinetrees. Will he say something about the situation and give the folks who live there some security so that they can sleep and not end up bankrupt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
Other houses in my constituency are also affected by the problem. The folk who live in them are suffering terribly. The Bill is too late; it should have been on the statute book some time ago. I plead with the Secretary of State to do something to help my constituents who are still living with the worry that, if it rains tomorrow night, their houses could be flooded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.14pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Bill is generally welcomed, but with several reservations. Questions remains to be answered, some of which members of the Committee have already posed. While it defines local authority duties in relation to flood prevention, it fails to deal with flood defence planning in Scotland. Some of the worst flooding often occurs on the coast, especially in Rothesay and Dunoon, where I recall huge waves crashing through the shops and flooding all the houses in the area. The term "flood prevention" is misleading. It implies that local authorities have a duty to prevent flooding, which is clearly unrealistic. People will say, "Oh good. We now have proper legislation in place to prevent flooding". Of course, that will not be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill sets out a piecemeal approach to the matter. We know that flood prevention work is one area can lead to flooding in another area. The approach under the Bill involving individual authorities is unlikely to be effective. For example, the River Clyde passes through five local authority areas. That implies joint working and the co-ordination of flood prevention activities between councils. I have to say that I have little faith in councils' abilities in that respect, a reservation borne out by their failure to maintain outdoor education centres and, more recently, concessionary fares on public transport. Such matters require joint planning between 12 councils, and no agreement could be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to survey all watercourses is surely unreasonable. It is essential that the Bill be changed to require surveys only of those watercourses with a history of flooding of non-agricultural land and property. Otherwise, the burden on local authorities, especially those in the highlands and islands area, will be huge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the Bill does not strengthen councils' powers to gain access to a watercourse. Such powers could be needed in an emergency such as that which occurred recently in Dunoon. Then, equipment had to be diverted a considerable distance to gain access to a watercourse in flood because a private landowner would not allow access over his stretch of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as all speakers have noted, the most important element of the Bill is the thorny question of finance. With councils facing severe financial constraints, it will be impossible to change the current enabling powers to a statutory duty unless there is adequate financial provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the challenge fund. That has been called a lottery or a tombola, but I shall call it a lucky dip. It is not the answer to the problem. I never thought that the Bellwin scheme was especially good, but I hope that the Minister will say whether it will be affected in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those questions can be dealt with and that the Bill can be suitably amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the debate, and grateful for the points raised by hon. Members from both sides of the Committee. Clearly, hon. Members have personal experience of the difficulties that flooding has caused in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in my opening remarks that many points have been made during the process of consultation. COSLA has raised a number of matters in an effort to ease the working of the Bill and to ensure that its principles are enacted. Through my officials I remain in consultation with COSLA, tackling some of the details with a view to tabling Government amendments during the Committee stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members spoke about funding. The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) called the challenge fund a tombola, the hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) called it a lottery, and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) called it a lucky dip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the parliamentary representatives of the areas involved should have so little faith in the arguments and cases put forward by their local authorities. The challenge fund is sensible and reasonable, and will enable authorities to carry out the larger capital projects which cannot be accommodated under the normal distribution of capital allocation. It is hoped that the challenge fund will allow the right priorities to be pursued throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, without prejudging the outcome of any deliberations, that individual authorities that can present a good case and argue it sensibly will be able to get funding for their projects. The beauty of the challenge fund is that it is not limited to one particular year; it can spread over several years, whereas a capital allocation is limited to a particular year. Hopefully, it will enable those projects to be taken forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) has said that he is coming to see me tomorrow and I look forward to hearing his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) talked about the two-year delay in bringing about the Bill. He and his party have made light of the Scottish Grand Committee and the changes to the Committee and its workings which were brought about by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his predecessor. I point out that because of the Committee's new powers, my right hon. Friend is able to utilise the Committee to present five Scottish Bills this year. Therefore the Committee has brought about this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only cause of the two-year delay. I hope that the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde will recognise that during those two years the points that he made in several letters to me have been taken on board. A significant consultation exercise has taken place, first, through the consultative document to which I referred and secondly, through the publication of the Bill in draft form. We have tried to draft a Bill that is not a party political issue but a means of ensuring that the misery described by both Opposition and Conservative Members will not have to be suffered in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that I have written to his Department and the district council to try to get a survey of the problem in my area, but I have not yet

received it. The chief executive of the district council wrote back to me to say that the information still has to go to the council and the Scottish Office. I would appreciate it if the Scottish Office could at least fill me in on the details of the proposals and the costs. I rely on the Minister for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. In this particular case, I will write to him in greater detail to save the Committee's time and to ensure that I cover other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun talked about the £3 million and how it had been shared out. It was topsliced to provide for higher support to those councils which were most affected, but most councils—not all—were given help of a varying nature. Again, I should be happy to write to him and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who also raised that point, giving further details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point about liability made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Clause 5 relates to riparian owners who have benefited from the maintenance and prevention work carried out by the Land Drainage Acts of 1930 and 1941. There have been riparian owners nearby who have not had the benefits of having that work carried out at the expense of the taxpayer. Of course, they have liabilities and this change to the Bill will not bring any greater liability to those who have had the benefits of the 1930 and 1941 Acts, compared to those who have already been carrying out their own maintenance and prevention work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries was agriculture Minister, he took a great interest in all matters agricultural and I know that he appreciates the difficulties of this scheme and the fact that agricultural methods have changed over the years. Equally, I recognise that there is a high concentration of beneficiaries in his part of the world. I hear his comments and those made by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden with regard to the timing of the removal of the facilities under clause 5. I shall take away the thought that the timing of the removal could be re-examined and shall return to it in later proceedings on the Bill. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his significant contribution to consultation on the document and the draft Bill and for relating his own experiences and those of many of his constituents, whom he has represented incredibly well for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government attach great importance to the Bill. The issues with which it deals are not party political. It is clear from most of today's short debate that the Committee probably agrees. The Committee also clearly agrees that something needs to be done to prevent flooding. The status quo is not a viable option. As I said earlier, too many people have suffered from the devastation that flooding can cause. I am, therefore, pleased to have had this opportunity to debate the principle of the Bill in the Grand Committee in Edinburgh. Its veracity is not in doubt and I look forward to it receiving widespread support. I commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Last time, the Secretary of State responded to the debate, which was prompted by the concern of myself and others about the review of the crofting grant loan scheme, which was then under way. The Secretary of State took the opportunity to announce a significant Government climb down and the maintenance of many of those schemes. Today, by contrast, the Minister of State will reply. I mean no disrespect to him, but given the Secretary of State's record of never missing the main public relations opportunities, I suspect that we need not look forward to a major climb down in Government policy on Skye bridge tolls.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic concern of those involved in the campaign has been to broaden its base. I want, therefore, to put on record my gratitude and that of those involved in the campaign with the 80-plus local authorities in Scotland, England and Wales that have written to the Prime Minister to express their opposition to the imposition of the high-toll regime bridge on the people of Skye and the Western Isles. I want to thank local campaigners of SCAT—Skye and Kyle Against Tolls—and of the earlier Skye Bridge Appeal Group for maintaining the issue's profile. I also want to thank them for the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and—although not in his official capacity as Chairman of the all-party Select Committee—the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudon (Mr. McKelvey) took the time to come and hear local opinion on the island. I hope that one or more of them will be able to put their feelings about the matter on record if I keep my remarks brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today represents the next stage in the on-going campaign to secure the abolition of the tolls. The turn of the year saw increases in toll charges, which were announced before Christmas and have now come into effect. Kathleen MacRae of the Skye Bridge Appeal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
Group put it well, given all the propaganda that Ministers have come out with over several years. When those increases were announced she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They keep telling us how well the bridge is doing, how it is ahead of schedule"—</p></blockquote>
financially, that is. She added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They stress the great benefit it is bringing to the island and the marvellous value of the £10.40 return toll for a car and £75 for a coach. If that is so, why are they now planning to increase the tolls? Are the bridge's financiers, the Bank of America, really that short of money?"</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting to hear the Minister of State's justification for the increases which have now come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) has said, I should say what really came out of our visit to Skye. Here was a bridge which was supposed to help the economy of the island of Skye and its people to make progress into the 21st century so that they could be on and off the island more swiftly and, indeed, more cheaply. Does my hon. Friend agree that all that happened is that an increased burden has been put on the islanders, which is intolerable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend sums up in a nutshell the mood of the meeting that she attended—I see Ministers shaking their heads—and I shall quote independently commissioned financial analysis which backs up her point lock, stock and barrel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to focus on three issues. First, legal actions—the trials in Dingwall sheriff court—are under way. I want to question the Minister regarding the handling of the matter. Last week, trials came before the court—five were laid down for the first day and one was completed. It has now been announced that the court's sittings will be extended from three days to five to try to cope with the huge and increasing backlog of criminal cases before it. Part of the reason for that is that, because the toll barrier happens to be on the mainland—the Lochalsh side of the bridge—it was decided at the outset, when the civil disobedience campaign began, to refer those cases to Dingwall sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the system is not coping and that, particularly for those based on Skye, hearing those cases at Dingwall sheriff court makes little practical sense and is causing massive public, judicial and police inconvenience. Why has not Portree been considered as a venue—that would have been self-evidently sensible—and why did not it commend itself to Ministers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, following my discussions with campaigners on the island last Friday I would be interested to hear the Minister's considered position. Perhaps he will clarify, to the benefit of all involved, exactly where the offence is committed if one chooses not to pay a toll on the ground of principle. For example, if one drives on to the Skye bridge from the Skye side it can be crossed twice without the toll barrier, which is located at the other side, being encountered. Is that an offence? The bridge would have been cross twice without a toll being paid, but, technically, the driver would not have refused to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person might approach the bridge from the mainland, refuse on principle to pay the toll—this is an example of the peaceful and good-natured protests that have been a hallmark of the continuing campaign—and then give his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
personal and vehicular details before choosing not to cross the bridge and turning round to come off the approach section. The bridge would not have been crossed, but, by refusing to pay a toll, and choosing not to cross the bridge, would a person have committed an offence? We would like to hear from Sir MacHumphrey just what is the position. That is the ludicrous depth to which this fiasco is descending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent who is a nonpayer of the toll on principle pointed out to me at the weekend that campaigners have been summoned on no fewer than eight successive occasions from the north of Skye to Dingwall sheriff court, but have never been called—their cases have not yet come before the Bench. What a ridiculous state of affairs in terms of personal cost, transport cost, loss of employment and working days lost for the people involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether he condemns law breaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given my view. Indeed, there is a motion on record, which I proposed at our Scottish party conference last year, acknowledging—I hope the Minister, as a democrat, would also acknowledge this—the fundamental human right in a democratic, liberal society for people consciously to break the law if they have a profound disagreement with it, providing that the individuals who take that conscious decision are willing to follow through the due processes of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In light of the way in which the letter of the law is being followed by protesters in terms of the subsequent hearings, the legal cases and the arguments that have been put forward in the Appeal Court and the Court of Session, as well as in the local sheriff courts, if the Scottish Office had displayed a similar adherence to the law of the land, it would not have commenced construction work on the bridge while the public inquiry was still under way.

Independent northern consultants were commissioned jointly by Skye and Lochalsh local enterprise and Highland regional council to carry out an economic assessment of the impact of the bridge. I shall give a couple of figures. From the date of the opening of the Skye bridge, which the Secretary of State so vividly remembers, to 30 September 1996, the figures for heavy goods vehicles—which are extremely important for the local economy—were down by 23.8 per cent.—nearly a quarter. Coaches were down by 23.6 per cent. I do not know how the Minister thinks those figures can be good news for the local economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The study estimated that the aggregate toll expenditure during the first year would have been £851,000. By applying a multiplier effect, it estimated that the removal of the toll would release £1 million
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
into the local economy of Skye and Lochalsh. Taking into account estimated additional spend by tourists and savings to local businesses from cheaper supplies if tolls were removed, it was estimated that the immediate benefit of removing tolls to Skye and Lochalsh would amount to £1.374 million. That is the equivalent of adding 92 full-time jobs to the local economy in an area of persistently and historically high unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures give the lie to the great economic news that the Government have been claiming. I want to quote a local business man who runs a coach company. He supplied me with these figures at the weekend. In the year from October 1994 he spent a little more than £40,000 conveying his passengers and vehicles across on the ferry. In October '95 to October '96, as a result of the bridge, he spent just under £60,000—a £20,000 or a one third increase in his overheads. His letter to the bridge company says, "We are unable to absorb these costs within our existing fare structure without introducing a substantial fares increase on the Skye section of our operation, which would add considerable concern locally."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a local business man speaking, and I quoted objective figures from the independent consultants' report, with which the Minister cannot argue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Secretary of State should be under no illusion as to the depth of the fury that his announcement during the Christmas recess about the building of a new Kincardine crossing has generated. It is to be toll-free. I shall quote the vice-convener of Highland regional council on the obvious question that is being asked by everyone locally. councillor Peter Peacock said in response to the announcement, "I am pleased the Government have returned to the principle that significant infrastructure projects should have their costs met by the taxpayers as a whole. That is equitable. However, the recent announcements bring into sharp focus the now wholly anomalous and utterly inequitable policy of tolls on the Skye bridge. People in Skye-Lochalsh feel even more intensely than ever that they are being unfairly discriminated against. In any democratic society where justice is seen as a fundamental, such inequities must be addressed." That puts it in a nutshell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I request that the Secretary of State agrees to meet with the council convener and myself as a matter of priority to discuss it. He has now acknowledged in response to my request that it will be appropriate for the first meeting of the Highland convention in Inverness in December to examine the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present situation is a disgrace to natural justice and it is rapidly becoming a legal and judicial farce. I hope that expression will be echoed on the Opposition side of the Committee, if not in the ministerial response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), to whom we are indebted for eventually getting the subject debated. I went to Skye, having read much of the literature about the problem, particularly in local weekend papers. I also listened to the deputation that visited the House. I must say that when I went to Skye to hear the deputation, I was deeply moved by its sincerity. It was a large meeting, comprising the complete cross-section of the community on the Isle of Skye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few people objected to the fact that the bridge was there—it was the extraordinary level of the tolls extracted from those who used the bridge that caused concern. A leaflet was distributed today by members of the campaign: it clearly shows the level of the toll and puts on record a comparison with other bridges. The Skye bridge toll ranges from £5.40 at the top to £4.40 for a car crossing. That compares with £1.85 on the Severn, £1.60 on the Humber, 60p on the Esk, and 40p on the Forth and the Tay. The cost to go across the Skye bridge is in a completely different league. It is the highest in the whole of Europe. Any independent-minded person would want an answer to that problem. If the answer is that it was necessary to cover the expense, we should query why the contract was given to an American bank in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholly support the campaign of people living on the Isle of Skye. Restrictive prices are creating difficulties for them and are hurting the economy. They should be reduced immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to say to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can come in later. I have been asked a number of questions by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). First, he is irresponsible to condone lawlessness. The quickest way to get a free bridge is through the route that we have chosen—the private finance initiative. No one should forget that £9 million was contributed by the public Exchequer for the approach roads. It is neither more nor less than a partnership project that involves the private sector. If the private sector were not involved, there would be no bridge, and the dream which we have fulfilled would not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
The Kincardine bridge is being built according to a priority given to it in our programme. As I made clear, the Skye bridge could not have been constructed using public funds for at least 20 years, probably much longer. It was possible to bring the building of the Skye bridge forward only because of private finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye asked about prosecutions in Dingwall sheriff court for non-payment of tolls. The offences are alleged to have been committed within the jurisdiction of Dingwall sheriff court—it is therefore appropriate that the cases should be prosecuted there. This is a matter for my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate. If it were thought necessary to ensure the efficient administration of justice, consideration could be given to trying some of these cases in other sheriff courts within the sheriffdom of Grampian and Highlands and Islands. That is a matter for the regional Procurator Fiscal at Aberdeen, and he is keeping it under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Gentleman when he suggests that the system is not coping. In the case of the Procurator Fiscal's office, additional administrative and prosecution resources have been made available by the regional Procurator Fiscal at Aberdeen at a cost of approximately £134 per day, which enables the office to cope despite the increased work load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye asked whether an offence had been constituted when someone crossed the bridge, turned round and went back. That is a matter for legal interpretation of the byelaws. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on hypothetical examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about heavy goods vehicles and toll increases. I take this opportunity to point out that the toll order specifies the maximum that can be charged and governs how increases are to operate. That means that in each calendar year there can be only one increase, which is in line with the retail prices index. In general, the overall carryings of all vehicles are up by 16 per cent. However, there may be fewer heavy goods vehicles crossing the bridge because companies are investing in buying one larger vehicle rather than running two smaller ones. Further research in the longer term will establish the facts of the case. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon. Gentleman laughs too much, let me say that this is undoubtedly an outstanding Scottish success story. A bridge to Skye has been the dream of many people since the 1930s. Thanks to the Government, that dream is a reality; more and more people are benefiting from having a bridge on which to travel to and from Skye. Carryings are up by 16 per cent. in the bridge's first year, compared with figures for the last year of the ferry, and the number of buses and coaches Crossing it is up by 38 per cent. That is good for tourism and good for Skye. The people of Skye and tourists are getting a better service. Using the bridge is quicker and more reliable than the ferry, and prices are generally lower than those that were charged by the ferry. That can only be good for the local and wider economies. I commend the Skye bridge as a Scottish success story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the people of Skye and the Western Isles should be grateful for this arrangement. Can he name a single other bridge in the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
United Kingdom which is part of a public highway, but which has to be paid for entirely by tolls without any contribution from the public sector? If this is such a splendid idea, why has it not been tried out elsewhere in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a public contribution of £9 million for the approach roads for the Skye bridge. It is undoubtedly a partnership project. What must be borne in mind is the number of carryings that will be operational. If the carryings increase, as we anticipate, we envisage that within 14 to 18 years it will be a free bridge. Because carryings have increased substantially, that period is likely to be closer to 14 than 18 years. More and more people are travelling to and from Skye with greater ease and reliability than was possible on the ferry. The bridge prices, even today, are still less than those on the ferry in 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986, two independent surveys found that 70 per cent. of Skye residents favoured a bridge. In recent years, one of the driving forces behind the idea was the Highland regional council, which approached the Scottish Office to press for a fixed crossing to Skye. Our roads programme was already heavily over-subscribed. It was clear that it would be at least 20 years, probably much longer, before the Government could fund a bridge from the public programme—well into the depths of the next century. Highland regional council, although fully committed to the project, could not itself bear the costs involved without severely affecting its other capital priorities. We met and consulted with Highland regional council, which in turn consulted with Skye and Lochalsh and the local community councils. Taking into account all views, the regional council agreed that the Scottish Office should undertake to provide a bridge on a private finance basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the developers. It is thanks to their hard work and commitment that islanders and visitors are able to take advantage of the increased reliability offered by a road crossing. The new link will bring significant economic benefits to Skye and I should make it absolutely clear that we are determined that the bridge tolls should be no greater than the existing ferry fares in real terms. The toll order ensures that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the bridge opened in October 1995, the tolls for almost all categories of vehicle were less, and in some cases substantially less than the equivalent ferry fares, not only in real terms but in cash terms. It is a welcome feature of the toll structure that the bridge tolls have a low-season price for most users, while the ferry charged a low-season price only to coaches. For those users benefiting from separate low-season prices, these are in all cases considerably less than the 1995 ferry fares. Since the ferry fares would, no doubt, have risen since 1995, I am sure that Opposition Members will recognise that, in real terms, the bridge prices represent an even bigger saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give a few examples, the charge in 1995 and 1996 for cars was set at £5.20 in the high season, reduced to £4.30 in the low season. That compared with a ferry fare of £5.40 all year round in 1995. The charges were recently increased for 1997 in line with the toll order. The 1997 low-season charge for cars is £4.40 and the high-season charge will be £5.40. While that is the same in cash terms as the 1995 ferry fare, it is still less in real terms. Regular
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
users of the bridge can also take advantage of the discount that reduces the 1997 toll to £2.51. That compares well with the equivalent discounted ferry fare of £3.10. The 1997 charges for coaches are £38.50 in the high season and £26.10 in the low season, compared to £41.10 and £27.80 on the ferry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those facts should be warmly welcomed by Opposition Members because the tolls are all less than the equivalent ferry fares. The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye should recognise that the bridge has undoubtedly brought great benefits to his constituents. The hon. Gentleman should not shake his head unless he is running in fear of Runrig.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not seem to understand the sheer injustice of the situation. the highlands and islands were deprived of investment in transport from the 1930s right up until 1964. Surely, the Government should make reparation for being so remiss in the past, which is one of the reasons why we lost so many people from the highlands and islands area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should be aware that Creagan bridge in her constituency is within the plans for proceeding within three years and the road on Mull has received extra funding from the challenge fund. There have been many developments in the highlands and western isles, such as the vatersay, causeway. Much higher funding for infrastructure is given per head of population to remote areas in the highlands than in the central belt of Scotland. Objective one status will help. While the late Willie Ross could say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The highlander is the man on every Scotsman's conscience".</p></blockquote>
today, I believe it is the drug addict. The highlander is doing very much better, and that is because have provided much more funding than the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bridge has played a valuable role in the economy of the island and I regret that a small group of protestors has, and is continuing, to refuse to pay the toll. I urge the protestors to recognise the benefits of the bridge and to start paying what is a perfectly reasonable toll in comparison with the ferry. The orchestrated opposition to tolls is both hypocritical and damaging to the interests of Skye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In plain terms, what is being protested about is an amenity that is both cheaper and more efficient than the previous arrangements. The protestors' attitude is not simply luddite: it is lunatic. Unfortunately, the message that is sent from Skye to the wider community is one of purblind resistance to improvement and modernisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Refusal to pay tolls is also unlawful. Breach of the law regardless of the alleged pretext is something that I should have expected the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye to condemn unequivocally. There is no room for ambiguity or for double standards on this matter. To give any measure of support to lawbreakers is a negation of everything for which Parliament stands. We must be unanimous in our condemnation of the so-called Skye bridge refusniks. It bodes ill for the hon. Gentleman to have condoned their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the studies and surveys that were commissioned by the Highland regional council and mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye. They purport to show that 208 jobs

or £2.5 million would accrue to the local economy if the tolls were removed. However, the bridge would not have been built without the necessary finance, which is being recovered through tolls.
