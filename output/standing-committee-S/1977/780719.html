	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Ray Carter)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Roads and Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
In a speech to the delegates attending the 1977 Northern Ireland Road Safety Congress I referred to the level of road casualties in Northern Ireland as bordering on the obscene. I believe that to be a totally apt description of the scale of the problem. Statistics show that road deaths in Northern Ireland per 10,000 vehicles registered are double that of Great Britain and that in every 1,000 road accidents, there are 60 fatalities as compared with 25 in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was my concern about these figures and the growing social problem they presented that prompted me in November 1976 to invite a small group of local people with a proven interest in road safety to examine the problem as a road accident study group and to make appropriate recommendations. I believe that the wide publicity which the group's report received focused public attention on the problem. One of its principal recommendations, a general increase in penalties for traffic law offences, is embodied in this draft order. Others are being acted on through administrative action within the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland or are being more closely studied. This is notably the case on the issue of drink and driving where the report expressed concern at the adequacy of existing legislation particularly in the light of the recommendation of the Blennerhassett Committee on the law and practice in Great Britain on this subject. I am all too aware of the high level of road casualties brought about by the drinking driver especially young drivers in Northern Ireland. Based on 1976 statistics,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
30 per cent. of all fatal accidents had drink as a principal factor. But the complexities of the law on the subject, bound up as they must be with police and court procedures, have persuaded me to postpone legislative action until I have studied the conclusions of a major review of the Province's existing law and practice on the subject. This review is currently under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the draft order is to bring the law on road traffic and safety in Northern Ireland more closely into line with that in Great Britain. A substantial part of the draft order is concerned with road safety. That I believe is timely because, as the security situation in Northern Ireland improves, I sense a growing public concern at the scale of road casualties in the Province. It is, therefore, appropriate that this Committe should take the lead in tackling the problem by strengthening the relevant legislation. I believe that this draft order contains a variety of quite significant improvements to road traffic and safety law which will assist the vital on-going programme to combat road casualties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the detailed provisions of the draft order. Article 3 seeks to remove the hazard which can be caused to other road users by placing builders' skips on public roads. I should perhaps explain that the term "builder's skip", by definition in article 5, covers all skips, whether they are used by builders or by householders for materials or for rubbish. Hon. Members will no doubt have noticed that the draft order published last December for public consultation would have required every skip deposited on a public road to have the permission of the Department of the Environment, but that in the order now before the Committee there is no requirement for such permission. The change has been made as the result of representations made during the consultation period by the Northern Ireland Federation of Building and Civil Engineering Contractors to the effect that the objective of road safety could be achieved without the delay, inconvenience and expense of having to seek the Department's consent to the placing of each skip. The Federation contended, and I have accepted, that the same measure of safety for other road users could be achieved by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
requirements that each skip should be carefully sited, properly marked and guarded, and should be lighted at night, together with power for the Department and the police to have skips removed. These general requirements parallel those in section 31 of the Highways Act 1971. The full detail of the requirements will be set out in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, then, the onus will remain on the owner of a skip to ensure that he does not deposit it in an obstructive or dangerous place, and that he complies with the requirements to ensure that it is immediately visible. Otherwise he would be committing an offence. Article 4 supplements these provisions by giving both the Department and the police the powers to remove or require the removal of any skip and if need be to recover any costs incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 provides a revised framework for the issue of driving licences. It is proposed that the licence should be valid for 10 years instead of the present three years and that persons over 70 years of age should be required to renew their licences at three yearly intervals. I should make it clear that there is no question of requiring persons reaching 70 years to take a further driving test, or necessarily to undergo medical examination. The proposals affecting that age group are in line with the requirements now operating in Great Britain. The article grants the Department discretion in relation to the issue of licences to persons suffering from disabilities or diseases and contains additional requirements for information concerning the physical fitness of drivers. No decision has yet been taken on the cost of the driving licence but some increase beyond the present £1 is inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will readily appreciate that the 10-year period of validity proposed for Northern Ireland driving licences falls short of the period of validity in Great Britain. The principal reason for this is that the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland dictate that driving licences there should carry a photograph of the holder and the 10-year period is seen as the most practical compromise between facial recognition, durability of licence material and the Great Britain " until 70 " period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 extends the restrictions on
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the sale or offer for sale of defective vehicles to the component parts of the vehicle. This is designed to close a loophole in existing law and is clearly of very real practicality where such components as tyres or brake linings are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 is concerned with the minimum ages and training of young drivers of heavy goods vehicles. At present the minimum age is 21 years but the article proposes that persons between 18 and 21 years will be able to drive such vehicles subject to meeting specified conditions as to training and employment. This age reduction has two purposes. The first is that young persons should not be deterred from joining the road transport industry by having to wait unduly long. The second is that new recruits to the industry should receive the best possible training. It is my intention to ensure that regulations made under this article offer a genuine apprenticeship scheme, not a cheap form of labour for employers in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 9 mirrors the main provisions of the Road Traffic (Foreign Vehicles) Act 1972 and deals with the enforcement of road traffic and transport law against foreign goods and passenger vehicles and their drivers. In speaking of "foreign vehicles" I am referring to vehicles registered outside the United Kingdom. Many thousands of these vehicles enter Northern Ireland each year, mainly from the Republic of Ireland, but as EEC commitments increase, from other countries as well. These vehicles are required to observe our traffic laws but not all do so. Some are grossly overloaded. some are mechanically unsound and others may not carry the requisite documents. Yet, as matters stand, the law cannot be effectively enforced against them since the offending foreign vehicle or driver will normally have left the Province before a summons can be served on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister say whether he considers that vehicles from Eire are foreign vehicles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I have just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally the foreign owner or driver is usually a person resident abroad and hence beyond the jurisdiction of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Northern Ireland courts. Effective sanctions are, therefore, minimal. Accordingly article 9 seeks to apply domestic enforcement procedures to foreign vehicles and their drivers but with the additional powers to meet the peculiar circumstances of the foreign driver or operator. As with domestic vehicles, power is sought to impose a prohibition on driving defective foreign vehicles until any defects are made good. Additional powers are sought to detain the vehicle and if need be to arrest the driver without warrant. The European Economic Commission has been consulted and has offered no objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 updates the requirements of the law on the issue of deposits and securities as alternatives to motor insurance policies. The present monetary levels have remained unchanged since 1920 and clearly have no relevance to today's money values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11 removes the concept of dangerous driving from road traffic law and replaces the existing offences of dangerous driving and causing death or injury by dangerous driving with the new offences of reckless driving and causing death or injury by reckless driving. The offence of careless driving remains unaltered. The proposals in this article adopt the provisions of section 50 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. The concept of dangerous driving has been criticised because of its all-embracing nature ranging from deliberately hazarding other road users to relatively minor faults which can scarcely be distinguished from careless driving. This difficulty does not arise with the concept of reckless driving since the court's interpretation of the word "reckless" precludes this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12 arises as a result of a decision in the courts. The police have power to give directions to traffic in a wide range of circumstances but not, in the opinion of the court, to directing traffic for surveys and censuses. The article enables them to do this. Answering questions at such surveys, however, remains absolutely voluntary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 13 read with schedule 1 varies the penalties for road traffic offences and largely brings these into line with those in Great Britain. The effect is to increase the maximum fines on summary conviction for most offences under the Road Traffic Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
to remove the option of imprisonment for all but the most serious offences. It is worthy of comment that the power to imprison for summary offences under the Road Traffic Acts in Great Britain is now restricted to the single offence of driving whilst disqualified. In Northern Ireland both the police and resident magistrates feel that the power to imprison should be retained for a wider range of offences and the article recognises their argument. Accordingly, it is proposed to retain imprisonment as an option for the summary offences of drinking and driving, driving whilst disqualified, failing to stop after an accident, reckless driving, forgery of documents and taking a vehicle without the owner's consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 14 together with schedule 2 deals with a very wide range of miscellaneous amendments. The proposal to increase the fixed penalty, applicable mainly for parking offences, from £2 to £6 is both necessary and overdue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 15 clarifies the Department's powers to issue driving licences while article 16 and schedule 3 deal with repeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that I have presented a very wide and varied set of proposals but I am sure that hon. Members will appreciate that this is in the very nature of the subject we are dealing with. There is no single solution to our road safety ills. The problem can only be tackled on a series of fronts each of which we hope, will make some positive contribution. That is the purpose of this draft order which I commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.43 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Gow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was originally the intention of the Government that this draft order and order to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory should be presented as a single draft order. I start by welcoming the decision of the Government not to include in this draft order the highly controversial proposals about the compulsory wearing of seat belts in Northern Ireland. In welcoming that change I ask the Minister to tell us whether the Government have now decided not to go ahead, at any rate in this session of Parliament, with the seat belt order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister also tell the Committee when the inquiry which he set
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
up on 20th March to look into the drink and driving laws in the Province is expected to present its report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began with a grave and timely warning about the terrifying carnage on the roads in Northern Ireland. In so far as this order increases penalties and brings the law of Northern Ireland into line with the law of Great Britain, I welcome it. There are one or two points which I should like to put to the Minister. First, when will a decision be taken about the cost of the new driving licence fee? The new licence is to last for 10 years. In Great Britain, the cost of a licence lasting up to the age of 70 is now £5. It is clearly an administrative convenience to have a licence which continues to the age of 70, though, in the Northern Ireland situation, and bearing in mind the decision to continue with the photograph, I understand why the 10-year period has been chosen. I do not understand why the Government have not yet been able to decide the cost of this licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am doubtful about the wisdom of reducing from 21 to 18 the age at which a person can obtain a heavy goods vehicle licence. The Minister referred to the loss of life and injury that occurs on the roads. My forecast is that if there is this reduction in the age at which a person can obtain a heavy goods vehicle licence there will be a disproportionate increase in the accident rate in the new age group. The arguments put forward for the reduction are not very convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great number of the penalties for driving offences in Northern Ireland have become wholly out of line. It is clearly right that those penalties should be very substantially increased, as the Government now propose. I hope that the Minister will deal with these points when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Down, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister introduced the order with some general observations. He did not—unlike the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) mention the unmentionable. I shall imitate the Minister rather than the hon. Member for Eastbourne. He did, however, refer to another absentee—probably a temporary absentee—from the order, namely any provisions in
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
regard to drink and driving. The only general observation that I wish to make is in that connection, against the background of the road accident experience in Northern Ireland, to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no aspect, either of delinquency or of penology, which is more mysterious than the causes of the incidence of road accidents, and the relationship between penalties and the incidence of road accidents. Anyone who approaches this matter in a simplistic mood and thinks that he can deal with a particular accident phenomenon by legislative provision or by tough penalties is deceiving himself and others. It may, indeed, be that some of these phenomena —for example, the different statistics as between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, which already in themselves contain an element of fallacy, since the averaging in the two cases is not the same sort of averaging—are in part due to factors so profound that we can probably never satisfactorily identify them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur entirely with the conclusion of the Minister that we must hit at targets as they present themselves. But we ought not to arouse exaggerated expectations of the consequences and ought not to be disappointed when we find that with our best endeavours, as in an order such as this, the behaviour of the road casualty statistics appears to be refractory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate that general theme, I shall refer to the Blennerhassett Report which the Minister mentioned. In one of the early paragraphs of that report—though some of the information was available earlier—the statistics produced by autopsy of drivers killed in road accidents are cited. The Minister will know that those statistics are devasting in their demonstration—I use the word in its scientific and calculated sense—that the entire operation of the breathalyser and all the other paraphernalia of the 1967 Act has had no effect whatsoever upon alcohol as a factor in the causation of road accidents. This is not the place to debate this, and I merely mention it as the most drastic illustration of the difficulties that we are up against in trying to relate legislative provision and penalty to accident experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, I come to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
order, and I want to make two prefatory comments on the way in which it is presented. The explanatory document which accompanied the proposals stated that the main purpose was to bring the law in Northern Ireland more closely into line with that in Great Britain. I want to put a suggestion to the Minister and the Government for future reference, and that is that it would be most helpful to those—not only in Parliament—who are considering proposals for draft orders if, where the main purpose is to bring Northern Ireland law more closely into accord with that in Great Britain, the explanatory memorandum could set out, at any rate, summarily, the main differences which will still remain. It is quite true that it is the duty of us all to do our homework, and I suppose we ought to work through with the Great Britain legislation in one hand, the Road Traffic Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 in the other hand, and in a third hand the proposals for the draft order. But there are limits to what flesh and blood can stand, and I am sure that the comments which are produced both at earlier stages and at this stage would be more effective and more helpful to the Government if they set out what would be the remaining differences so that those considering the proposals might focus their attention upon them. I hope that that suggestion, which is meant in very good part, might be taken into account in the many future orders which we shall have to bring the law in Northern Ireland more closely into line with that in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second suggestion is that where, as in the case of this order, substantial alterations are made between the proposals stage and the draft stage, the publication of the draft stage should be accompanied by a note upon those items which appear for the first time in the draft as opposed to being in the proposals. I admit that this has been done in a number of cases. Notably, it was done most helpfully in the context of matrimonial causes. But the Minister will recognise that the contents of article 11 of this order bear no resemblance to the contents of article 11 in the propsals and that, therefore, the student of the draft order has no explanation whatsoever to assist him since, of course, the explanation which accom-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
panied the proposals did not refer to the then not yet existent article 11. I do not believe that this would be a serious burden. There would of course be no statutory conditions attaching to such a supplementary explanatory memorandum, but I believe that in future this would be found helpful by those who have to deal with these orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to take the provisions of the order in sequence, and I hope the Minister will not take it amiss if points of detail, sometimes very small detail, come up. As he will appreciate, this is primary legislation, and today's debate is Second Reading, Committee Stage, Report Stage, Third Reading and, one must be careful to add, Lords amendments as well. So, as we are doing a considerable feat of telescoping, perhaps I shall be forgiven for raising what would be regarded as very much Committee points, though at this stage all they can do is to evoke explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3—the control of builders' skips—is very welcome in principle, and I should like to say that the Minister was undoubtedly wise to drop the original proposals for a licensing system which would have been extremely cumbrous, would have caused great irritation and perhaps would have led to more breaches of the law than can be expected with the order in its present form. This is one of the many instances where the second source rendered possible by the proposal procedure has been to the benefit of all concerned.

I have one minor query on article 4(1). It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a builder's skip has been deposited on a road the Department or a constable in uniform may require the owner"</p></blockquote>
to do this or that. The imagination easily grasps the concept of a constable in uniform laying his hand upon the skip. It is more difficult to imagine the Department doing it. I note that elsewhere in the order the reference is to an authorised officer or agent of the Department. I wonder, therefore, whether the use of the Department as such in this context is fully covered by precedent, because it appears to be a curious use of "Department" rather than, as it states elsewhere in the order, someone duly authorised for the purpose by the Department. One can understand the Department's appearance in other mat-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
ters—approving regulations and making orders—but laying hands on skips does seem to be rather below the dignity and the abstraction of the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to article 8. Here again, I believe that the Minister has been wise, if I have understood the article correctly, to reduce the detailed requirements in this order. But I was puzzled when, in his explanation, the Minister appeared to be referring to the imposition of certain conditions including training, and to the making of regulations. It may be that a late night sitting and other causes are to blame but, although such matters are referred to in the explanatory memorandum, I confess that I cannot find them in article 8 as it stands. I think it would be helpful if the Minister would refer to the regulation-making power, which does not appear to be included in the article, and if he would fill the Committee in a little more on the sort of conditions which it is intended to impose. It is rather hard when legislating to be told that regulations are going to be made to impose this and that condition, and to have no sight whatsoever either of the regulations or of the enabling powers. If the Minister will look at the explanatory note on article 8 and compare it with the article as it stands at the moment, I think he will appreciate my difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to article 9 and foreign vehicles, including foreign goods vehicles and foreign public service vehicles. The Minister said, in the simplest possible terms, that a foreign vehicle was a vehicle not registered in the United Kingdom. One would have thought that that was a very satisfactory and sufficient description. But not so in—I think I had better refer to pages for simplicity— page 12 of the order, new clause 741 (1), under the heading " foreign goods vehicle ". The clumsiness is not mine, I do not believe a more simple form of reference exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order defines a "foreign goods vehicle". It defines it in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) says that it is a vehicle
	<br><blockquote><p>"which has been brought temporarily into Northern Ireland and does not remain in Northern Ireland for more than three months ".</p></blockquote>
Could we have more explanation of that matter? I do not see how, when a vehicle has been in Northern Ireland for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
month, one can tell whether it is a foreign goods vehicle. Only the eye of God can tell whether it will remain in Northern Ireland for not more than three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How something which is prospective at the material time can be part of a definition I fail to comprehend, unless of course the prosecution and the proceedings are to wait until the expiry of the three months period and it will then be said "This was a foreign goods vehicle after all." No, not even that. If they wait for three months it will have gone, so it will be a foreign goods vehicle only if it has disappeared from the jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty here which is perhaps slightly more than that of drafting. There appears to be some degree of superfluity, not to say pleinism, between a vehicle being brought temporarily into Northern Ireland and not remaining there for more than three months. If a three month duration of stay, however mysterious prospectively, is the condition, surely "been brought temporarily" is otiose. It is difficult to imagine a vehicle brought permanently into Northern Ireland which stays there for less than three months. Perhaps the Minister, therefore, would direct his attention to the explanation of the extraordinary paragraph (a) in the middle of page 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of great practical importance, because there will be furious arguments when it is sought to implement this new provision. When a foreign vehicle is to be—I use an informal word —arrested, we shall need to be sure of our footing. Therefore, the wording of this paragraph must be of great importance. I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy the Committee on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second difficulty of definition is that I cannot for the life of me decide whether paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) are cumulative. Is there deemed to be at the end of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) the word "and" or the word "or"? I hope that the Minister takes my point. Is it sufficient to constitute a foreign goods vehicle that it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not remain in Northern Ireland for more than three months,"</p></blockquote>
or must it also be engaged
	<br><blockquote><p>"in carrying goods by road on a journey some part of which has taken place, or will take place, outside the United Kingdom."?</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Must it, in addition, not be used as described in paragraph (	<i>c</i>)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister can complain at members of the Committee finding these difficulties when the only explanation which he gave to them of the meaning of a foreign vehicle is that it is a vehicle:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not registered in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
If he could bring the order more into accord with that definition the police and all those concerned would be grateful to him. To establish, before arresting a vehicle, beyond reasonable doubt, all the conditions laid down in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) will be some job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for foreign vehicles. I come now to article 10. There are two points I wish to raise on that article, which deals with the increase in the amounts of deposit of securities. The first relates to the explanatory memorandum. It concludes with this sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The article is based on proposals which will be presented by the Department of Transport as soon as practicable."</p></blockquote>
It is hard to be presented with an article in an order which we have to pass—at least, we do not have to pass it but we shall pass it, because we need it—and to be told that it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is based on proposals which will be presented by the Department of Transport as soon as practicable."</p></blockquote>
I am not criticising the Minister, but steps should have been taken to supply hon. Members representing Northern Ireland constituencies at least with some knowledge of what lies behind those words, otherwise we are, in the most explicit manner, being invited to legislate in the dark. Can the Minister give us more information about what lies beyond that mysterious reference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article inserts in the principal Act the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other amounts as the Department may by order specify."</p></blockquote>
I presume that "order" for that purpose is defined in the principal Act, though it does not appear to be defined in section 190, the interpretation section. But I am sure that the Committee would be glad to know under what terms the order is to be made which is to alter again—which is to fix—the financial amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked here, as a legis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
lature, to take a figure out of an Act of Parliament and substitute:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other amounts as the Department may by order specify".</p></blockquote>
It will be observed that if that order is not subject to some parliamentary process we are taking a specification out of an Act of Parliament and giving the power, without restraint, to a Minister. I am not here trenching—or not avoidably trenching—upon the old ground of the interim provisions of 1974 in so far as they affect order and regulation making. I am just asking the Minister to assure the Committee that when the Department, from time to time, proceeds to specify a different figure from that in the Act of Parliament, there will be parliamentary knowledge and procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that the figure should be raised. Most of us probably agree that it should be capable of being further raised, if and when necessary, by order, and that it should not require substantive legislation. But we ought to be satisfied, when that order is made, what will happen to it. In what form shall we see it? Will it be one of those statutory rules and orders in which there is a sentence in italics under the title which adverts to the fact that we may pray against it? What will be its status? I dare say that two or three research assistants, working overtime, could have produced the answer for me, but I am sure that the Minister will have it pat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to article 11, "Reckless driving". The Minister has explained that it duplicates the new provision in the Criminal Law Act 1977. All that I wish to observe on this article, in addition to what I have said already, is to reinforce my point about the explanatory memorandum. Here is something which is not contained in the corresponding Great Britain road traffic legislation, but which one has to seek in a different Great Britain statute altogether. I am sure that the Minister will be reinforced in taking my position for the future. I hope that this may result, indeed, in a departmental policy on explanatory memoranda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some difficulties in connection with article 12, "Traffic surveys". The explanatory document informed the public that
	<br><blockquote><p>"drivers who comply with any directions for the purposes of a traffic census are not to be required to give any information "—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
that is to say, they must comply with the order " turn left at the notice ", but they do not have to give any infor- mation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"nor to be unreasonably delayed."</p></blockquote>
This is not so. The order prescribes something quite different. I refer to paragraph (4) of the new clause 137A. It runs as follows. I apologise for reading it at length, but the point depends upon the construction of the—I see. Yes. I am somewhat reassured by certain signs that the point has already been taken in the Department but, nevertheless, I might put it on the record. Article 12 137A(4) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power to give a traffic direction…shall be so exercised as not to cause any unreasonable delay "</p></blockquote>
and here follow the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to a person who indicates that he is unwilling to furnish any information for the purposes of the survey."</p></blockquote>
This is most unjust. If a man turns left at the side and onto the hard shoulder and—well, I restrain my language in the Committee, but a variety of expressions would occur to hon. Members—tells them where to put their traffic survey, shall we leave it there? In that case he must not be subject to any unreasonable delay. If he is unwilling to furnish any information, then he is covered by statute, and there must be no unreason- able delay. Woe betide the driver who, thinking it part, perhaps, of his public duty, moved by public spirit, thinks: "Well I ought to give some information. These poor birds "—I mean officials— " have been standing by the road for hours and hours with their forms, I had better help them to fill them up ". He can be subjected to unreasonable delay with impunity because he was not un- willing to furnish the information. So this is the direct invitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motoring associations in Northern Ireland ought to warn their members: "If you wish to avoid unreasonable delay at traffic censuses, then you must refuse to give any information ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that there is either some different construction from that which appears to me—and I have had a good many tries at it—or that something has gone wrong and will need to be put right. There is a further difficulty, perhaps not so ludicrous but, nevertheless, a real difficulty, in the preceding subsection (3) which refers to:
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the direction or indication to stop a vehicle, to make it proceed to a particular point…does not include a direction or indication requiring any person to furnish information…"</p></blockquote>
I quite understand the purposes of that provision. It is that the movement of one's car, the compliance with the direction "go onto the hard shoulder", is mandatory. And it is an offence not to do it. But there is no power to compel the giving of information. If that is the position, is it not curious to refer to a direction or indication requiring any person to furnish any information, as though by other provisions or under other powers, such a direction or indication could be given? And that is rather strengthened by the use of the word "requiring".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made my difficulty clear to the Minister. 'We seem at one and the same time to be stating the existence or possibility of the existence of a direction requiring a person to give information, but we are saying only that the compulsion is not constituted by this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it right to draw attention to a number of those points. I am sure they are not exhausted, and I make that observation not by way of apology but in order that the Committee should remind itself of the inherent risks of making substantive legislation by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay full tribute to the efforts which the Government make to secure—and I have made some suggestions this morning for further improvement on that—mature consideration of an order before it obtains its fixed form. Nevertheless, we must admit—and our experience of dealing with Bills in Committee apprises us of this—that there will still be in an order of this sort, the application of which will affect ordinary citizens going about their ordinary business, points which have not been taken, points which have not been noticed, but points, most of which would probably have been thrown up in the course of debate upon a Question such as, That clause 11 stand part of the Bill. This is not a difficulty which either the Minister or we at this moment can remedy but it ought to be salutarily present in our minds in all the steps for dealing with orders of this kind and perhaps it ought to render the Minister more ready to bring forward, if necessary, amending and supplementary orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I would like to say—and I am sure that I speak on behalf of my colleagues —that we would far sooner, if improvements have to be made to this order, be faced with another order next month, rather than that the Province should have to carry on with a form of the law which is not perfect. So as long as we legislate by order let us not hesitate, where amendments have to be made, to bring them forward in good time, however many they have to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wm. Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) may not have exhausted the contents of the order but I believe the Committee will agree that he has certainly gravely depleted it. I will not weary the Committee by repeating what he said. I wish to make one or two small points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be no surprise to anyone in Northern Ireland that, due to the drop in money values, it has been found necessary to inflation-proof the fines and other matters that are embodied in the order. I certainly welcome this because I believe that fines are probably the best way of dealing with many traffic offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11, referred to by my right hon. Friend, relating to the disqualification of drivers, with imprisonment for reckless driving, especially whenever they cause major accidents or death, is one that I believe will be widely welcomed in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points I wish to make about the order. First, I would like to put a question mark over the value of disqualification as a deterrent in general in the circumstances that exist in Northern Ireland. Secondly, I would like to say a few words about the enforcement of the law relating to traffic offences in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I especially question the effectiveness of loss of licence in the case of young people when there is not a tight check on offenders. I believe that. for young people especially, the short, sharp sting of a heavy fine is probably the best medicine. It is the best medicine for the young first offender because it hits that person where it most hurts and brings home to him the fact that he cannot expect to get away with breaking the law with impunity. Among young
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
people in Northern Ireland at present there seems to be a common belief that because law enforcement for traffic offences is, to put it mildly, fairly lax in some areas, they can get away with it. This is particularly true with respect to disqualified drivers. One continually hears in one's travels in the constituency of people who lost their licences but immediately went out and resumed driving and who got away with it for perhaps the whole period of disqualification. This is a very serious matter indeed. The law is held utterly in contempt and brought into disrepute. This is of no help whatsoever to law enforcement or the betterment of driving standards in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember that the efficiency of a penalty depends not only upon the fact that it can be enforced but upon the effect that it has on the person suffering that penalty. Any member of the Committee who has talked to a man whose livelihood depends upon his driving licence, or who talks to that man's wife or mother, soon realises that a heavy fine might have an even greater effect than the fear of losing his licence. In fact, it might have the salutary effect of preventing people from falling into those wayward habits again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point questions the whole basis of dealing with drivers who break the law. It is a question that goes much further than the extent of this order and one that I hope the Minister will take on board before the next order is considered—especially that relating to drunken driving. That is matter which concerns us all very much. I would like to see the basic problem attacked rather than just the issue that appears on the surface.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of enforcement in Northern Ireland is a tremendous one. I do not want to belittle the efforts that the police have made, but I think that we can say that at the moment they are pretty ineffectual. With the decrease in violence, one would hope that a greater number of police—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.21 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>THE CHAIRMAN'S</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>attention having been called to the fact that five Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings: and other Members having come into the room, and five Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that short interlude, I am happy to continue and conclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the level of violence in Northern Ireland decreases, there is an opportunity to move more police into the traffic branches to strengthen them. It is an area where there is a need for the strictest application of the law. It is an area that has been grossly neglected in the past 10 years, and one which, even at the moment, could be improved by an increase in the overtime allowance given to the traffic branch of the RUC. This is apparently less than that allowed to other branches of the police force in Northern Ireland. Certainly the existing strength of the RUC should make more excursions into areas where the police do not operate with complete freedom. We who live in such areas—I live in one of them—are very much aware that the police are inhibited in their actions and in their application and enforcement of the law in these areas. I believe that much more could be done than has been done and I would certainly hope to see an improvement in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one brief question concerning skips. May I ask the Minister whether there is a statutory obligation on the owners or users of skips to insure the general public and drivers against accidents involving skips, which are sometimes caused through no fault of the driver? Is it intended that the paint which is referred to in article 3 should be reflective paint? That would certainly go a long way towards alleviating some of the problems that arise with skips being parked in odd places—usually with most of the paint knocked off them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to article 10, which refers to the sum of £15,000. May I ask what is the present level in the rest of the United Kingdom and what other obligations are to be demanded in lieu of third party insurance in Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Londonderry (Mr. Ross) drew the Committee's attention to an important factor, namely the enactment of laws that are not being enforced and cannot be enforced in certain sections of the community in Northern Ireland. Every right thinking person in Northern Ireland realises that we have a serious problems as regards deaths on the roads—which are greater
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
than the number of deaths caused by terrorism—and other road accidents. Of course, much—perhaps the greatest part —of the problem results from drink and driving. That is what the traffic branch of the Royal Ulster Constabulary tells us. The Minister, in answers in the House, has confirmed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me, however, as a Member from Northern Ireland, is that we are passing laws that are not being enforced and cannot be enforced. There are some laws which, if they were enforced, would help to reduce the accident scale and also, perhaps, help to save lives. But the police find it impossible, under certain circumstances, to enforce those laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister has applied his mind to this subject. I know that a committee has been taking evidence from various people. Therefore, I would be interested to know when this committee is likely to produce its report. Even if the committee produces a report highlighting—as I believe it will—the menace of drinking and driving on the roads of Northern Ireland, how can we deal with the matter if we find that the police are not able to enforce the existing laws? That is a problem to which the Government must set their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have raised their eyebrows when the hon. Member for Londonderry mentioned that there are parts of Northern Ireland where the law cannot be enforced, but that happens to be a fact of life. There may not now be "no-go" areas in Northern Ireland, but there are certainly no " no-stay " areas where the police and the army move so quickly through an area that it would be completely impossible for them to carry out a law enforcement operation. Those happen to be the facts of life which we in this Committee need to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which has been highlighted in the debate is the fact that we are governing Northern Ireland by laws made by Order in Council. The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) highlighted some of the weaknesses of that procedure. At time goes on, however, we see more and more of those weaknesses. If the threat to life on the roads of Northern Ireland is greater now than the threat of terrorism is it not strange that when we meet today to have a Second Reading, a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Committee stage, a Report stage and Third Reading combined, Northern Ireland Members cannot keep the Committee in session because they are not members of it and therefore do not count for purposes of a quorum? It seems that in such a serious situation Northern Ireland Members should not be dependent on other hon. Members to keep this Committee in session. This is a serious matter, and it seems very strange that, because of the way in which the Government are laying these Orders in Council, we must depend not upon the Northern Ireland Members but on other Members of this House to make a quorum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a vote taken in this Committee, those of us who are not Members of the Committee, but have a right of audience, would have no right to vote. Yet we are dealing with one of the most crucial areas that is causing great concern and heart-searching in the whole of Northern Ireland. This highlights the total inadequacy of the present system of governing Northern Ireland, of making laws for Northern Ireland, and the terrible failure of the Government to enforce laws that are enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised the question of goods vehicles coming from the Republic because this has caused great concern to the traders of Northern Ireland and to those employed in the transport industry. The Minister assures us that such vehicles would be treated as foreign vehicles. But on page 12 of the draft order, amazing conditions of definition are laid down and the foreign dimension is spelt out to us. It is stated that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"foreign goods vehicle ' means a goods vehicle…
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(	<i>c</i>) which is not used at any time during the said journey for the carriage of goods loaded at one place in the United Kingdom and delivered at another place in the United Kingdom ".
<br><br><!-- lb --></li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
How is a police officer to find out, before he makes an arrest of such a vehicle, that it did not carry a package from the border to Larne, from where it was to be shipped to this part of the United Kingdom? It is an impossibility. It cannot be done. What is more, this definition means that every Eire vehicle that comes over has the advantage of this loophole. It will take a few packages from a certain place in the United Kingdom—the border of our country—and will
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
deliver them to some other place in the United Kingdom. Many of these vehicles do this anyway. The definition gets them out of difficulty. They are no longer foreign vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is preposterous. I never thought that I would ever read an Order in Council that would create such a loophole. Perhaps this loophole is in keeping with the policy of the Government in regard to the Republic. In the House, the Republic has the best of both worlds. The citizens of the Republic are not counted as aliens by the House. They are a special category. The Government are supposed to be against special categories, but we have now discovered that there is a special category of goods vehicles and that these goods vehicles can avoid this description of "foreign goods vehicle". I do not think that under this Order in Council it will be possible to nail these goods vehicles from the Republic which are breaking many of the laws in Northern Ireland and getting away with it. The Minister and the Government must apply themselves to this article.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other points were highlighted by the right hon. Member for Down, South. I do not want to repeat his arguments but they equally apply. We are putting the police into a position when they must make an arrest and when, to make that arrest, they must possess superhuman powers. They must have superhuman intelligence to carry out this part of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shakes his head. When he rises to his feet I shall listen carefully to hear how the police will know, before an arrest is made, that a goods vehicle has not picked up some goods at the border and carried them to some other part of Northern Ireland, thus avoiding the definition of a foreign goods vehicle. Suppose that these people carried the goods for a quarter of a mile, or 100 yards, and left them. They are completely exonerated because the vehicle is not a foreign goods vehicle under this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard it said that, because of inflation, fines should be increased. I have read carefully through the schedules to this order and I would like the Minister to tell me—it seems that there is a doubling of the maximum fines, £50 to £100 and so on—why in section 132, a fine of £100 for careless driving goes up to a maximum fine of £500? Why is there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
this departure from simply doubling the fines? In section 178 the fine for failure to comply with the requirement as to the weighing of a vehicle or a trailer is increased from £50 to £400.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there a departure from the doubling-up of fines? There may be other cases which have escaped my scrutiny of this schedule. It seems strange that in these cases there should be such an increase of the fines. Money is not worth what it was, and probably, as inflation increases, the value of our money will decline further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter I should like to raise with the Minister. I understand that under the law in Britain if a person is disqualified, he is disqualified only in respect of the vehicle that he was using at that time. There are many farmers in Northern Ireland who, for one reason or another, have been disqualified, and who find that the disqualification applies even to their agricultural vehicles. These cases come before the Secretary of State over and over again. A farmer has been disqualified, say, for not having insurance and he finds that he cannot travel on the road by tractor. He cannot cross the road with his agricultural vehicle because of the disqualification. I am told by the legal authorities in Northern Ireland that they do not have the authority to disqualify a person in respect of one vehicle. It is an entire disqualification. I should like the Minister to comment on that because it is of vital importance to the farming community. I have raised this matter with Secretaries of State, as they have come and gone, and they have confirmed that the law in Northern Ireland is different from the law in the rest of the United Kingdom on this aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell us his thinking with regard to seat belts. Are we to have the Order in Council this session or is it to be postponed? The people of Northern Ireland are entitled to know what is in the mind of the Government since the Minister has written to all the Members from Northern Ireland seeking their support..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I take a great interest in Northern Ireland but I have been an infrequent speaker in Northern Ireland debates recently. One or two
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
comments I have heard this morning suggest that an English Member should speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was quite horrified by the latter suggestions of the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley). If one of his constituents drives a motor car in a state of inebriation, as the hon. Gentleman has suggested, putting other people at very great risk and we have noted that a considerable number of people in Northern Ireland are given to drinking alcohol to excess—he is putting a large number of people at great risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law, quite properly, will remove his driving licence and prohibit him from driving. The hon. Gentleman, like me no doubt, deplores drunken driving. Indeed, he may have deplored it on Sunday mornings and Sunday afternoons with the vigour with which we associate the conduct of his other occupation. I welcome that. I believe that drinking to excess is deplorable and that the law should be firm in its response.

But I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman—perhaps because he represents a large number of farmers—should suggest that a man who is drunk driving a car should be prevented from driving his car but should then be free to mount his tractor and drive along the country lanes of Antrim, or anywhere else, with absolute impunity. The hon. Gentleman is being extremely inconsistent in his treatment of this problem. I should have expected a much more stern and Calvanistic response to that offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have listened to me. I was dealing with people disqualified for not having insurance. I am sternly against drunken driving. If a man drinks and goes to the wheel of any vehicle he must be put off the road. I would ban him for all time. I want to make that clear. I was referring to offences not connected with drink.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am extremely glad that we have that correction on record. However, I add that although I take a hard view about drinking to excess I would not take my rather Puritan attitudes to the point of never accepting that there is a possibility of redemption so that forgiveness can be applied at some time.

I have been disappointed by the attitude of hon. Gentlemen during this debate, particularly by those of the hon. Member for Londonderry (Mr. Ross) and the hon. Member for Antrim, North, who spoke about the need to improve the enforcement of law in Northern Ireland and yet made no reference that I can recall to the fact that this week the Government have taken steps to ensure that there is adequate law-enforcement capacity by seeing to it that the police are properly remunerated so that, thereby, police recruitment may forge ahead. There could have been a reference to the fact that there are more policemen—and were more policemen before Monday's announcement—than there were in 1974 when the Conservatives, who have been making a great deal of noise about law and order, were responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has presented this order and that this Committee has had an opportunity to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wm. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that when I made my remarks I draw attention to the fact that I was asking for a transfer of police power from one aspect of law enforcement to that affecting driving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. There was a fundamental difference in the sense that until the improvement in police remuneration which the Home Secretary announced on Monday it could well have been that a transfer of resources from one activity to another would have meant that new difficulties and disadvantages would have arisen elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is justified in giving this Committee the opportunity to consider these proposals, since what I find astonishing—perhaps hon. Members could comment on it—is the strange situation whereby there is an apparent disregard for life and limb, as illustrated by the appalling figures for traffic accidents, yet the suicide rate in Northern Ireland is remarkably low—despite the fact that its politicians are often tempted to make much longer speeches than we do in the northern areas of England. This suggests that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and his hon. Friends could engage a team of experts to provide
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
an explanation for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point I would make, and I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to bear this in mind, relates to the comment of the hon. Member for Londonderry about fines. In Northern Ireland, as in parts of England—Northern Ireland Members often forget that this applies in parts of England there is considerable unemployment and there are still many people with comparatively low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the courts were generally and universally, and perhaps savagely, to increase their fines, for which there is a good case in many circumstances, there is a strong likelihood that at least a proportion, perhaps even a substantial proportion, of those who are to be fined so heavily by the courts would not have the capacity to pay. The Minister may not feel it appropriate to discuss this point this morning, but is he satisfied that there are enough alternatives to the heavy fines which ought to be inflicted by the courts and which some people who appear before them may have an inadequate capacity to pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.46 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Molyneaux</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I am confident In speaking on behalf of my colleagues in assuring the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy) that he needs to make no apology for, as he seemed to imply, intruding on our debate. Far from that, we welcome his contribution and that of the hon. Member for Easbourne (Mr. Gow) who is representing the official Opposition. Both of those hon. Members have more right to speak in this Committee than I, because they are fully nominated members of the Committee, whereas I am not. We regard this and other Committees as miniatures of the House of Commons, and we have never sought to deny or discourage contributions from hon. Members who represent other parts of the United Kingdom to which we all belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's point about suicide rates dropping, it is generally accepted that suicide rates in any country drop when life becomes exciting. Life is never dull in Northern Ireland. I am not thinking in a facetious way of the security situation; but the Minister would probably confirm that in the political life of Northern Ireland there is never a dull moment. Perhaps the suicide rate in Great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Britain will drop in the interval between now and 5th or 12th October, or whatever the dale may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point of the hon. Member for Rother Valley about the Royal Ulster Constabulary, I am sure that he was in the House when the Home Secretary made his announcement. I hope that he will have heard the tribute which I paid to Her Majesty's Government for the general increase in police pay throughout the United Kingdom and, in particular, the increase in the special allowance to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to follow the hon. Gentleman in his reference to drinking and driving. The Minister said that, although drink was a major factor in the accident rate in Northern Ireland, the problem was being further examined and, strictly speaking, did not come within the terms of this order. We must look not only at enforcement measures against what one might call the mobile, if somewhat erratic, offenders, but at the enforcement of the liquor licensing laws in Northern Ireland in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those rare occasions when we who serve in this House are released from bondage before the hour of 11 o'clock and make our way home to our respective quarters and billets in London, we notice that the patrons of various licensed establishments here in London are turfed out on to the pavement somewhere around 11.05. That does not happen in Northern Ireland. It is not solely the fault of the police. I have always felt that the licensing legislation in Northern Ireland is defective in that it permits far too much flexibility. It is certainly not unknown for me to see car parks adjacent to public houses chock-a-block as late as midnight and, in many cases, long after. There could be a tightening of the law here. No one will convince me that people sittting until that time of night are going to single out the unfortunate driver and say "Well, you can stay on bitter lemon until well after midnight while the rest of us get tanked up." That is just not in human nature. There would be very few drivers volunteering for that chore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 82 of the principal Act lists the point about failure to give information—this is listed in schedule 1 of the order. I want, very briefly, to look at a different aspect of it. The amending order in 1976
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
laid a requirement on the citizen to provide information when requested to a traffic warden. But I am not sure that that is generally known in Northern Ireland, despite the Government's attempts to publicise it. Perhaps the rest of us did not play our full part in that either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an example—one of many—where a constituent was caught in this trap. He was not aware that he was required to give his name and address to a traffic warden. He had good reason for refusing to give it because he was a member of the security forces. He took the view that if he had not come back from his errand to the bank in time to encounter the traffic warden, the traffic warden would have had no means of discovering his name and address. He felt. therefore, that he was not required to give the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The curious thing is that although today we are upping the penalty for such failure from a fine of £20 on first conviction to a fine of £200, my constituent was fined and in addition was disqualified for driving for a year. That, admittedly. was reduced on appeal, but he was still disqualified for a period of six months. It makes me wonder exactly what we are doing, if we are simply increasing the fine from £20 to £200 when in the past, before we started this operation and before the draft order was laid, a court could disqualify a citizen of Northern Ireland from driving for a period of 12 months in addition to imposing a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 178 of the principal Act is listed at least twice in this order. I have to plead guilty with regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) who asked why. the fine was being increased from £50 to £400. He felt that that was too much of a jump. This section makes provision for the weighing of vehicles and their trailers. As my right hon. Friend has indicated, section 7411 of part IV of the order extends the powers to cover foreign vehicles. But the reason for my guilt complex in this matter is that on 29th July 1976—it can be checked at c.847 of the 	<i>Official Report</i>—I raised the matter of the overloading of heavy goods vehicles. I gave as an example vehicles which were designed to carry 13½ tons being overloaded to a, point where they were carrying 22 tons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Northern Ireland—the hon. Member for Liverpool Kirkdale (Mr. Dunn)—perhaps at this point on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends I could express regret at the news of his illness and ask the Minister to convey our best wishes for a speedy recovery—at that time shared my concern and indicated that enforcement measures would be stepped up. In reply to my supplementary question on that occasion he undertook to investigate the activities of offending firms if I would supply the information. With the help of some of my colleagues I supplied a very detailed list of known offenders and there was evidence that an attempt was made to tighten up the regulations with regard to these offending companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid, however, that there has been some reversion to the bad old days. We now find that a great many people are still breaking the law and, what is even worse, they are making it totally impossible for the law-abiding companies to observe it. This is where I would defend the very large increase in the fines because there is big money involved in this operation. The effect of certain companies ignoring the law is to place at grave economic disadvantage those companies that observe the regulations, because, obviously, if the payload of a vehicle can be increased by some 50 per cent. that operator is in a strong position to undercut all law-abiding rivals in what is a very competitive activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the various regulations that we are up-dating and introducing in the order are to be effective, they have to be respected. Most of the sophisticated and expensive heavy vehicles have certain built-in devices to ensure, for example, that they do not exceed given speed limits. One has heard curious cases where drivers have been stopped, accused, summoned and convicted of exceeding the maximum speed limit although they have been able to provide expert evidence to prove that the vehicle which they were driving at the time could not possibly have come within 20 mph of the speed at which they were accused of travelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of interest, I have a copy of a certificate which was provided by expert witnesses but ignored by both the police and the court. In that case
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the offending driver was disqualified for 12 months and lost his job as a consequence. That is the sort of circumstance in which we would like the authorities, the police and the courts to take greater account of the scientific aids to law enforcement. I do not believe that enough is being done in that regard while far too much emphasis is being placed on guesswork and rule of thumb assessments..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>CHAIRMAN'S</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that five Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and five Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molyneaux</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all greatly concerned at the accident rate and slaughter on the roads of Northern Ireland. I am not sure that speed limit enforcement is the only answer. We all know that a relatively high speed in certain conditions and circumstances can be much safer than someone acting recklessly in a congested area. There is an event that I sometimes facetiously call the South Kensington grand prix. I never cease to be thrilled by the spectacle at the intersection with Gloucester Road when the light changes to green and there is what amounts almost to a massed start of three lanes of traffic in either direction. This is a case where traffic is accelerating to something like 60 or 70 mph before reaching the air terminal in Cromwell Road. Curiously, drivers seem able to do this without any interference from the law enforcement authorities at least until they enter the territory of the Thames Valley police authority which seems to be much more active, at any rate so far as certain members of the Royal Family are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the greatest factor is reckless driving. In this area lies the greatest scope for improvement and enforcement. I would have no mercy on offenders in this category. When they are apprehended and convicted they should he clobbered severely. I do not think that it purely a question affecting young drivers, although a great number of them contribute to many accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think another category of driver at fault is the conceited, self-styled expert driver. One has only to watch his activity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
on the motorways in Northern Ireland. I do not know whether anyone here has ever had that thrilling experience, but it is something to behold. Even experienced drivers who think that they know all about driving will persist in misusing the fast lane on a motorway when overtaking. They will go up behind a comparatively slow-moving vehicle knowing quite well that they will have to undertake it. They will then commence to pull out into the fast lane. For some extraordinary reason, even though no vehicle may be approaching them from behind in the fast lane, they seem to be under some compulsion to cut in ahead of the vehicle which they are overtaking. It is this constant weaving in and out on the motorways in Northern Ireland which must create a great many accidents—statistics will show it—and is certainly the cause of great alarm and hazard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to assure the Minister that we fully share his concern and horror at the accident rate in Northern Ireland. We have done our best in this Committee to be constructive in our approach to the problem. Our attitude is to seek to discourage offenders by supporting the enforcement of the law in Northern Ireland, and we shall continue to support the Minister in using such influence as we possess to encourage road safety education in all its aspects. As far as the unmentionable subject is concerned, I do not exclude the voluntary use of seat belts. We should do everything we can to encourage the voluntary wearing of seat belts in Northern Ireland and any other devices which may be thought useful and valuable in reducing death and injury on the roads in Northern Ireland..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I at once thank the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) for his remarks about my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. Dunn). I am sure that we all hope that his illness is not serious and that he will make a quick recovery and be back with us soon. I shall certainly pass on to him the hon. Members remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remarks have been made this morning about the way in which we are dealing with this legislation. In fact, on almost every occasion that we have a meeting
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
in this room, or even on the Floor of the House, the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and, indeed, others, will query the effectiveness of the way in which we deal with Northern Ireland business. They say that there are inherent difficulties as, of course, there are. No one can run away from that fact. I am well aware of it myself. I shall be dealing with road safety here, with rents tonight and with education the night after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The morning after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The morning after. I certainly do not pretend to be an expert in all three areas, but such is our constitutional life at the moment in Northern Ireland affairs that it is necessary for Ministers to spread themselves across subject matters of that sort. I must deal with what is quite a wide subject—road traffic law—in this Committee and try at the same time to answer every point that has been made in a constructive and as nearly accurate a fashion as possible. I only hope that in responding to the debate I can fulfil that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one fact that I wish to impress upon people—although I am sure that most members of the Committee are aware of it—is that road safety in Northern Ireland, abstracting that as an element from the order, is now reaching crisis proportions. We have to bring home to people just how much the loss of life and accidents on the road to vehicles and to people is costing the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an enormous economic loss to the community. There is the resulting burden on the hospital service, on general Practitioners, and on medicine generally. There is also the burden that results on the economy generally—on industry and commerce. We can observe none of these without passing criticism and, indeed, judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) said that loss of life and accidents on the roads were now reaching proportions greater than that attributed to violence. The truth is that that has always been the case. In terms of grief, if one could put it in the scales, it is greater for families and relatives than that attributable to violence, but somehow that passes unnoticed. An accident on the road is somehow more tolerable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
than an accident, or, indeed, violence, attributable to the political and civil strife in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A measure of the increasing Government awareness of the problem and our determination to deal with this appalling loss of life is the fact that we have now persuaded the RUC—indeed, the traffic branch within the RUC has been able to convince its superiors—that we must step up surveillance on the roads. There has been a considerable increase in the strength of the RUC traffic branch over the past few months. I dare say that hon. hon. Members have noticed that evidence of this is to be found on the roads in clearly-marked police cars. People can now see that the RUC is getting back in earnest into the business of road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) asked the all-important question about seat belts and whether it was contemplated that compulsory wearing of seat belts would be introduced. In the limited time that we have left in this Session, it is still hoped that the seat belt proposal will be introduced. As the Committee will know, there will be a free vote, and hon. Members can decide on the issue on the basis of their attitude towards the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the draft order be introduced into another place first, or here first?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was Press speculation. I do not know where that story originated. I could not say "Yes" or "No" to it now. I personally hope that it will be introduced in the Commons and that we can find the time to debate the issue and allow right hon. and hon. Members to pass judgment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked when we should be able to make an announcement on drink and driving legislation. In the Departments, we have carried out the necessary review of the law. We have made known our proposals within Government and are now asking for comments from the various agencies that would be involved, such as the police. Early in the autumn, I hope to make public our final proposals and ask for comment from political parties and everybody else involved, so that we can get a further input into our pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
posals before finally coming forward with legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that fairly widespread support has been voiced in the Committee this morning for an uprating of the law, and I should think that when legislation is finally introduced, it will be on the basis of a fairly united approach by all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member went on to ask when the licence fee would be made known. I cannot give him a positive answer today, as we are still looking at the mechanics of producing the licence and the form that it should take. It is a matter of what technology we use to produce the licence, and, until we know what form we will use, we will not know how much it will cost. The cost will have some bearing on the ultimate step by which we will raise the licence fee. The hon. Member for Eastbourne did not find the idea attractive of reducing the age at which one could have a heavy goods vehicle licence from 21 to 18. I should have thought that there was fairly wide agreement in society that the adult stage now starts at 18, not 21. Our view as a Department—and we have carried the industry with us on this—is that it would be far better to get people in at the age of 18 to train, rather than to leave it to the later age of 21. After all, there are a lot of people of 18 driving cars now, and it is obvious that some of them would want to take the professional step of moving on to heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) questioned the use of accident statistics as a means of determining how we should attack the appalling loss of life and injury on the roads. I must agree with him in that respect, because none of us is able to extract complete accuracy from statistics. We can all use our own means of interpretation, but there are sometimes certain clear lines of evidence, such as drinking associated with driving, and it would be a unanimous opinion to suggest that we should move in a certain direction on the basis of that statistical evidence in order to tighten up the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Government, we have a responsibility, notwithstanding that we are aware of the fallibility of statistical evidence, to act where we can see fairly clear proof that further action is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member said that what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
we should do in terms of Northern Ireland legislation was to produce an explanatory document, when we reached a stage such as this, highlighting the differences that would remain between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That is a useful suggestion. Of course, when we have a draft, we always produce a memorandum with the draft and highlight all the areas, sometimes in a crude fashion, where we remain different in Northern Ireland from the rest of Great Britain. But on his suggestion, when we come to the stage of an order or a Bill, we could probably produce something more detailed to let people know the precise difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Molyneaux</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say on behalf of my colleagues that we have greatly appreciated the co-operation of the Under-Secretary of State and of his fellow Ministers. On being requested for such detailed information, they were very helpful in providing a breakdown of the comparisons between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and of what is being proposed in Northern Ireland. An extension of that would be a great help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for his remarks. It has always been my intention to make available as much in- formation as possible. If we do that, we can proceed with legislation in a much more efficient way, and, what is more, the public, as a consequence, will be much better informed than they otherwise would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member raised a question on article 4. He questioned the ability of an authorised person to take action on a skip which he thought to be illegally placed. The drafting is in line with present legislation. The Department is the road authority and is authorised elsewhere to construct roads and to remove obstructions from roads. Prior to the reorganisation of local government in Northern Ireland, similar powers rested with local authorities. In Great Britain, the highway authority is given identical powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister looks at page 12, line 4, he will see a reference to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an officer of the Department",</p></blockquote>
and so on, and it seemed more natural that in this context, which is very
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
similar, the same sort of formula might be used. I do not press the Minister on what is essentially a drafting matter, but I wonder whether he would have it looked at, because this will not be the last road traffic order that we shall have to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly note that and let the right hon. Member know why there is a distinction in two separate parts of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 9 deals with the determination of a foreign vehicle. The three months' reference follows closely on the Road Traffic (Foreign Vehicles) Act 1972. Any period in excess of three months pre-sumes a domicile. Proof of the period is a matter for enforcement officers. The right hon. Member for Down, South, judged by his facial expression, is not satisfied. But we only determine the status of a vehicle if it is apprehended by an officer of the law. I should like the hon. Member for Antrim, North to take note of this. If a vehicle, from whatever source it emanates, is behaving or appears to be behaving in accordance with the law, whether it is foreign or domiciliary is of no account. The question of its status would be raised only if it was thought that it or its driver was committing an offence. If it was thought that it was committing an offence, the records—the status and origins of the vehicle and so on—would be determined by the officer who made the apprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still wonder whether the Minister has seen the difficulty. Let us suppose that a vehicle brought temporarily into Northern Ireland is in its second month there. How will it be made clear that it is a vehicle which does not remain in Northern Ireland for more than three months? The owner or the driver can say, "I am here for six months." I could understand it if the provision had read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"has not been in Northern Ireland continuously on that occasion for more than three months."</p></blockquote>
But I do not understand how one can describe it as a vehicle not remaining for more than three months when it has only come over today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to think off the top of my head unless someone else is thinking for me now. The point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1977-1978V004P0I1224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
of entry and the date of entry would be known. Whether a vehicle had been in the country for two months, three months or nine months would be determined only when the officer examined the records, and in order for those records to be examined the officer would have had to think that an offence was being committed. There is no means of detecting on mere sight whether a vehicle has been in the country for one week or one year. That would have to be discovered in the process of an examination of the documentation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I fear that I am wearying the Committee. I quite accept that it is possible at the time of apprehension to ascertain how long a vehicle has been—presumably continuously—in Northern Ireland. But how one finds out that it is a vehicle that does not remain in Northern Ireland for more than three months, I cannot understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wm. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister further? For how long does a foreign vehicle have to be in the United Kingdom before, in law, it has to be reregistered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the relevance of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it might be relevant. I am still trying to see the relevance of the right hon. Gentleman's point. I shall have to go away and consider the matter closely and let the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister at the same time direct his mind and his answer—which perhaps he will also send to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the point that the right hon. Gentleman is trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am doing my best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always do my best, although sometimes it may be inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a country such as Northern Ireland with a long and raking border, problems of the kind that 'the right hon. Gentleman is thinking of are bound to be produced. But, knowing them as I do, I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland and the RUC will find a way of administering the law effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to article 10. The increase in the amount of the deposit will be made by subordinate legislation under the statutory rule procedure. The statutory rule will be scrutinised by the examiner of statutory rules to ensure that it is 	<i>ultra vires.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it belong to that class of statutory rule and order which prayable? I have an idea that such orders tend to fall within that class when they prescribe sums of money. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the affirmative. I was told that it would be prayable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we can have a prayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of reckless versus dangerous or careless driving, the right hon. Gentleman suggested that we might, in the explanatory memorandum, spell out precisely what is meant and where we may be in conflict with, or have a different system from, the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I can take the right hon. Gentleman very far on the question of surveys. We have tried to make it clear in the wording used that powers are given to the law officers to halt a vehicle and and ask it to co-operate, but that there is no compulsion in the request that can be made. We shall have to leave the resolution of the matter to custom and practice. The issue seems to me to be quite clear-cut. We are giving powers to the police, but we are not compelling those who are requested to provide information to stay. That seems quite clear to me. If the right hon. Gentleman is not satisfied with either the wording of the legislation or my explanation, we shall try to give him something more definite in reply. I do not think that it would require redrafting. Perhaps by explana-

	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
tion I can persuade the right hon. Member that it is satisfactory as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Londonderry (Mr. Ross) questioned the ability of the disqualification procedure to keep people off the road once they have committed a serious offence or a series of offences. That may have been true in the past but, with an improved ability on the part of the RUC to police our roads, what was admittedly a serious problem will disappear in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member went on to say that he wanted to see greater activity on the part of the RUC on our roads. Everybody would endorse what he said. It is a question of resources, although we arc now getting a greater RUC presence on the roads. He has probably seen cars that are now clearly marked, not only on our motorways but on secondary roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to skips and accidents to other vehicles, that would be a matter for civil action. Anyone involved in an accident with a wrongfully-placed skip would proceed through the courts in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, North, echoing the hon. Member for Londonderry, said that enforcement was not adequate. Of course it is not adequate at present and no one could pretend that it is. We still have a state of civil disturbance in Northern Ireland and it is regrettable that police forces which should be going about normal matters within the community are diverted to other and more difficult areas. But gradually, with the reduction in violence, more and more members of the RUC are turning to such matters as road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the fatal accident rate in Northern Ireland is now reaching a state where it exceeds the fatalities attributable to violence. That simply is not so. We have always, certainly over the past 20 years, lost more life due to road accidents than have been attributable to acts of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, North wanted to know why there was a jump in the fines of the level that he sees in the order. This is an attempt to reflect the seriousness of the offence. That is what we try to do throughout the document—to relate the fine to the offence involved and to its seriousness. The licence that he referred to relates to all
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
vehicles. If he examines his own driving licence he will see that it covers every form of vehicle and exceptions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister aware that one licence does not cover every form of vehicle? They are issued in Northern Ireland only for a particular vehicle and people have to be examined on other vehicles before another licence is issued. The Minister cannot get away with that. He should be aware of the facts before he makes such a statement about a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a responsible citizen of the society of Northern Ireland. I represent a large number of people and I know a little about my own driving licence. The Minister must realise that in Northern Ireland we have many difficulties. As he knows, I am very strongly against breaking the law and I would feel very strongly about a person who took out a car and used it to damage life or to kill. That person should be off the road forever. But there are cases where disqualifications in Northern Ireland are not for drunken driving or damage to life but because of an insurance offence. That was the matter I put to the Minister. It means that a man is put out of work. I am sure that the Minister wants as many people to work in Northern Ireland as possible, particularly in view of the figures that were revealed to us yesterday, which cast a shadow over us all. We are all concerned about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but if a person commits a driving offence on the public highway, he will certainly not he in a position where he is disqualified from driving one form of vehicle but enabled to drive another form of vehicle. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can see the thread that runs through that argument. It would be inappropriate that a man licensed to drive a tractor and disqualified from driving a saloon car should he allowed to take a tractor on to the public highway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that this is what is happening this side of the water under the present state of the law? I am asking why it happens on this side of the water and why do answers that I receive from Northern Ireland Office say that the law is different? That is the argument that is put all the time to me by my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is the case, but if the hon. Member is not satisfied with what I am telling him I shall let him know in a detailed reply.

My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy) referred to fines as a means of combating offences on the road, but wondered whether there were other means of dealing with offenders. I think that he would rather I wrote him a letter than spend any time on dealing with the subject. I shall take the hint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) said that there was never a dull moment in Northern Ireland. Of course, he is right. However, sometimes my description of life in Northern Ireland varies with both time and place. He questioned licensing laws and said that our supervision of them was inadequate. That is an aspect of the drinking and driving legislation that we certainly hope to deal with in the autumn. He said that there was not enough awareness of traffic laws and regulations, fines and so on in Northern Ireland and quoted one or two cases to
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
demonstrate his point. That is probably true. We undoubtedly could do more to make people more aware of both the scope of the law and the penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member queried whether we had been vigorous enough in the past in pursuing known offenders against heavy goods vehicles regulations. If we have been given information that could be followed up by the RUC we would certainly have investigated every complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered most of the points that have been made. Where I have not satisfied people, such as the right hon. Member for Down, South on the status of foreign vehicles, I will write, in the hope that I can convince hon. Members that we have got it just about right in the order. I commend the order to the Committee..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
