DRAFT EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES) ORDER 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Frank Judd)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft European Space Agency (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
This order, which will be made under the International Organisations Act 1968, was laid before the House on 13th June.<br><br>
Members may be aware that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has not yet reported on the order. The Committee has given it preliminary consideration and my Department has supplied further information which was requested on a technical point concerning the Director-General's entitlement to relief from customs duty and VAT on petrol. I feel confident that the information given by my Department will satisfy the Joint Committee on this point.<br><br>
However, I recognise that there is significant procedural issue at stake here, and I can give hon. Members an undertaking that the order will not be taken on the Floor of the House until the report of the Joint Committee has been issued.<br><br>
The purpose of the order is to confer upon the European Space Agency, and persons connected with it, the privileges and immunities which are required to be conferred in accordance with Annex I to the convention for the Establishment of a European Space Agency, which was presented to Parliament in October 1975. The Convention was signed by 10 European States on 30th May 1975, and will enter into force when it has been ratified by all the signatories. So far six of these have deposited instruments of ratification, the United Kingdom having done so on 28th March this year. The remaining four signatories expect to be able to ratify within the next 12 months.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The decision to establish the Agency was embodied in a resolution adopted at the European Space Conference in December 1972 and confirmed in July 1973. The new European Space Agency has been formed from the European Space Research Organisation and the European Laboratory for the Development and Construction of Space Vehicle Launchers. Its aim is to integrate the member countries' natonal programme as far and as fast as reasonably possible.<br><br>
The Agency now represents the major European collaborative body in a high technology industry which involves, among other things, application—mainly telecommunication—and research satellites. The focal point of the Agency's current activities is the telecommunications programme comprising a regional telecommunications satellite network; a maritime communications satellite programme; a heavy satellite for experimental direct television broadcasting, and an advanced systems and technology programme. The interest and contribution levels of the member States in the different programmes vary, but the United Kingdom is now concentrating in the activities of the Agency most of the expenditure—about £37 million a year—which it devotes to space applications and research.<br><br>
The headquarters of the Agency is in Paris and there are no plans at present to have any Agency premises or permanent employees in the United Kingdom. The scale of privileges and immunities to be accorded to the Agency and its staff by this draft order does not go beyond the limits to which we have agreed in the Convention. It is broadly similar to the scales accorded to other international organisations to which we are a party. Immunity from suit and legal process in the case of traffic offences is specifically excluded. Since it revokes the two orders which granted privileges and immunities to the two organisations which are being replaced by the European Space Agency, the draft order will not effectively increase the privileges and immunities which we are already required to confer. In fact, it might be regarded as a formality. Hon. Members will see from what I have said that the application of the draft order is likely to be very limited. I hope that the Committee will approve this order and thus demonstrate its continuing support for the valuable work of the Agency.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down may I ask whether there is any particular urgency for this order to go through the Committee this week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Judd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is always, at this time of year, a problem about the business of the House. I have looked at this matter very closely. It would be helpful if we could clear it this week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on this point? I understand that, merely for the purpose of the business of the Government, it is desirable to bring the order on this week. From the point of view of the order itself, is there any reason for having this order this week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Judd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that basically we are trying to finish the business before the House in time for the Summer Recess. There is always a problem at this time of the year of quart measures and pint pots. However, I hope that the right hon. Member will be satisfied because I respect and understand his special interest in this problem. I hope that he will be satisfied with the point I have made.<br><br>
Perhaps I should add that the request for further information from his Committee came after this meeting had already been arranged..</span></p>
<p>10.37 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hurd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition strongly support the work of the European Space Agency and wish it well. Nevertheless, it is the job of the Committee to scrutinise orders of this kind with some care and when a Minister comes to tell us that an order should be treated as a formality we then have to scrutinise it with even more care than we would otherwise have done.<br><br>
I say at once that there is a procedural point which I believe is of substantial importance and which I would have developed. However, I am glad to see my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) here and I understand that it will be possible for him to intervene in our proceedings. Therefore, I will leave him to develop this point out of his experience with the force which it deserves. Having some knowledge of what he intends to say, I believe that this is a very important point,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
the more so because it has been offended against in the past. This is a pattern of practice that seems in danger of being established and which undermines the whole principle of the consideration of these orders by Committees. However, I will not go into that issue at present.<br><br>
I would like to ask the Minister two questions. The Minister said—and this is included in the explanatory notes to the order—that the privileges set out in the order replace two earlier orders which covered the two previous organizations—ELDO and ESRO. He said that the privileges in the order were effectively the same. I believe that we need to pin him down on this. Are they exactly the same? Has there been any increase, in this successor order, of the privileges provided in the two parent orders? This is the kind of point where we need precision and an exact clarification, because one matter we have to watch for is additional privileges, perhaps of a minor sort, being slipped in when two organisations merge and a new order is necessary.<br><br>
The second question I wish to ask the Minister is how many people are involved. Of course, the headquarters are in Paris and we noted his statement that there is no plan to establish a sub-office of some kind in the United Kingdom at present. Nevertheless, I believe that it is important to know how many people are on the staff of the agency, what plans there are for increasing it, if any, and therefore what numbers of people are likely to be covered by Parts IV and V of the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) it may be helpful if I clarify a point of order. I draw the attention of the Committee to Standing Order No. 73A(2) which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any Member, not being a member of such a standing committee may take part in the deliberations of the Committee, but shall not vote or make any motion or move any amendment or be counted in the quorum."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>10.41 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Watkins. I was well aware of that Standing Order and I am grateful to you for calling me. I am not a member of the Committee and therefore if there is a vote of this Committee I do not take part.<br><br>
Parliament has set up a Joint Select Committee of both Houses consisting of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1977-1978V004P0I1197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
their Lordships and hon. Members of the House of Commons to examine every Statutory Instrument for which there is parliamentary procedure and to advise or to report to the House if that Committee considers that that Statutory Instrument is <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the Minister making it or if there is something wrong with its drafting, or if it requires elucidation or it is an unexpected use of power.<br><br>
Because Parliament has set up a Committee of this sort, a Joint Committee of both Houses which spends a considerable time each week examining the Statutory Instruments, one would expect that the Department concerned with the Statutory Instrument, or at least the usual channels, would ensure that that Committee had had an opportunity to consider the Instrument and, if it felt it necessary, to report it to the House. This is not the first occasion on which a Statutory Instrument has been brought before a Standing Committee before the Statutory Instruments Committee has completed its investigations. On four occasions in the past 12 months, Instruments have had to be withdrawn, because of a valid complaint by the Statutory Instruments Committee, after they had been considered on their merits.<br><br>
The order before us today came before the Statutory Instruments Committee, and it must have been well known to the Department that the Committee had not finished its deliberations on it. Nevertheless, it appeared on the Order Paper as coming before this Standing Committee. In the meantime the Statutory Instruments Committee had asked the Department for a memorandum on a particular point on the order. Before the Committee has had the opportunity to consider that memorandum, the order is now before this Committee on its merits.<br><br>
I do not think that it is too strong to say that this is treating both Parliament and this Committee with contempt. If Parliament sets up a Committee to study Statutory Instruments and to report to it on their validity, it seems quite ridiculous to bring the Statutory Instrument on for debate before that Committee has reported. The Minister said that the Department had provided further information. That is true, but not in time for the Statutory Instruments Committee to consider it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Under those circumstances, the Minister's undertaking is entirely insufficient. He has said that he will see that the order is not brought before the House until the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has reported. But it cannot then be debated on the Floor of the House. Under our procedure there is no debate on the motion to approve the Instrument when it camel before the House if it has been debated in this Committee.<br><br>
All the Minister is saying is that the Committee must go on and debate this order this morning, on its merits, without knowing whether it is <i>ultra vires</i> in any particular instance. Of course he is confident that his order is <i>intra vires.</i> That is the whole point of having a Statutory Instruments Committee—to tell the Minister that he is wrong on these occasion But he is insisting that this Committee continue to debate the order on its merits and if he is satisfied that a Committee set up by Parliament is right in its complaint about this order, he will take some administrative action—I suppose to drop the order altogether and not bring it before the House.<br><br>
This is not good enough. I hope that this Committee, although I have no vote on it, will say that it has not considered this order today because it has not had the opportunity of receiving any report from the Statutory Instruments Committee on a matter on which it has asked the Department for a memorandum. In that way the Committee will let the Department know that there is some complaint about the order.<br><br>
Having made that protest and said that I think the Committee ought not to complete its consideration of the order today, may I turn to the merits of the order? The order deals, as has been said, with the European Space Agency, which had its origin in the Convention for its establishment. That Convention is set out in Cmnd. 6272. The agency is to have diplomatic immunities and privileges and Her Majesty in Council has the power under the parent statute, as appears in the preamble to this draft order, the International Organisations Act 1968, to grant those privileges and immunities to a body of this sort, but only so far as that Act allows—if I may summarise—plus the privileges and immunities required by the Convention and war.<br><br>
The order deals with immunities and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1977-1978V004P0I1198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
privileges to which agents of comparable rank are entitled. Part IV of the order deals with officers and Article 15 with high officers, in particular the Director General of the Agency who is, I assume, on all fours with officers of high rank in the diplomatic service. In Article 15(1)(<i>d</i>) Her Majesty is given power, by Order in Council, to grant:
<br><blockquote><p>"relief, under arrangements made by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, by way of refund of customs duty paid on or value added tax paid on the importation of any hydrocarbon oil … which is bought in the United Kingdom by him or on his behalf, such relief to be subject to compliance with such conditions as may be imposed in accordance with the arrangements."</p></blockquote>
I stress the words
<br><blockquote><p>"by him or on his behalf"—</p></blockquote>
That means that the Director General would get a refund of the customs duty and VAT elements in the price of petrol which he buys. But the equivalent diplomatic agent—the person by whom we must judge whether this order is within the powers of Her Majesty in Council—under the Diplomatic and Other Privileges Act is allowed a refund only in respect of petrol bought for his personal use, or that of his family forming part of his household.<br><br>
My contention is that this order goes beyond that, in saying that the Director General shall have relief for petrol bought in the United Kingdom—
<br><blockquote><p>"by him or on his behalf"—</p></blockquote>
which, in short, means that he can then do anything he likes with it. It need not be for his personal use, or for the use of his family. My contention is that the privilege should have been restricted to petrol for his personal use, or that of his family forming part of his household.<br><br>
I am fully aware that there are certain precedents for the words used in the order. I do not think that the fact that there are precedents makes those words any more valid—any more <i>intra vires.</i> About 3,000 Statutory Instruments a year are approved and it is not surprising that some of them contain errors which are not discovered until, perhaps, another order repeats those errors at a later date. In this case it is my contention that this order should have restricted the privilege of the Director General of the Agency, in getting relief on his purchase of hydrocarbon oil, to purchases for his personal use or that of his family forming part of his household.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
It may be argued that this can be arranged in conditions imposed by Customs and Excise. Under the latter part of subparagraph (<i>d</i>), the Director General gets relief only if he acts in compliance with:
<br><blockquote><p>"such conditions as may be imposed in accordance with the arrangements".</p></blockquote>
It may be said that Customs and Excise may impose the condition, which I say is required by statute, that he must use this petrol only for his personal use or that of his family. But the conditions imposed by the Customs and Excise on a person claiming under this order relief, repayment of Customs and Excise duty and VAT from a petrol purchase, do not say that. I have before me a form which an officer of an organisation such as this has to complete in making his claim for refund. The only restriction of that sort on the form is a requirement to give a certificate as to the use of what he has purchased. The form states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I certify that the items covered by this claim were purchased for the use of privileged members of the staff of this organisation and that no repayment of duty or VAT has previously been claimed in respect of any part of this claim."</p></blockquote>
That does not require the officer to certify that the petrol was purchased for his own use or for the use of his family who are part of his household. It says only:
<br><blockquote><p>"purchased for the use of privileged members of the staff of this organisation".</p></blockquote>
That does not really carry out the terms of the statute.<br><br>
It would not be satisfactory if one had to rely on the conditions imposed by the Customs and Excise to carry out something that is required by statute. Such a provision should be included in the order. But even if that is the argument, the terms do not carry out the statute. Therefore, in this respect the order is invalid and should be withdrawn and that article redrafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Judd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the observations made by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Conservative Bench have been very interesting. I shall try to deal with them in the order in which they have arisen.<br><br>
On the point about privileges being effectively the same, I can confirm that that is the case. The orders are drafted somewhat differently to take account, in one case, of the International Organisations Act 1968. but I can assure hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1977-1978V004P0I1199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
that no greater privileges will be accorded as a result of the new order.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Mid-Oxon (Mr. Hurd) raised another point about the number of people covered. It might be helpful if I gave him a breakdown because there are various centres of the organisation. There is a total of 1,500 people, with 250 in Paris, 1,200 in the Netherlands, 150 in Germany and 150 in Italy.<br><br>
That brings me to the points made by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). First, I should like to make it absolutely clear that, having had the privilege over many years of witnessing the work that he and his colleagues do in this vital area of parliamentary responsibility, I would place myself second to none in putting on record my appreciation, not only of the work they do, but of the way in which they do it. Perhaps I should also say that I have a great deal of sympathy with the points which the right hon. Gentleman has made. I can assure him that they will receive full and proper consideration from all the authorities involved.<br><br>
We were in a somewhat difficult position, as I indicated earlier, because the request for further information came to us after this meeting had been set up. There is another problem and that is that we wanted, rightly or wrongly, to clear this with the Privy Council before the Summer Recess. That imposes certain restrictions in terms of available time. But I repeat the undertaking that I gave to the right hon. Gentleman, that there will be no question of this order being put before the House of Commons before his Committee has had an opportunity to comment. Of course, the comments which it makes will be given full and proper consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Recently the Committee gave an assurance to the Leader of the House that, on any occasion when an order was required quickly, when it was necessary to bring an order before a Committee of this sort before the Statutory Instruments Committee had completed its investigation, the Statutory Instruments Committee would call a special meeting to complete its investigation if it was so notified. It was not so notified in this case.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Judd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly look into that point and I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for making it. But I repeat that there will be no question of the order going before the House—it would be quite improper in my opinion—before his Committee has had an opportunity to comment properly and for those views to be taken fully into account.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the point which has preoccupied his Committee and which has led to this request for further information. It would, perhaps, be helpful for this Committee if I were to quote the information which we are supplying to his Committee as the basis for our view that this order is <i>intra vires.</i> We say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The point raised by the Joint Committee after their preliminary consideration concerns Article 15(1)(<i>d</i>) of the draft Order. Under this Article a High Officer, that is the Secretary-General of the Agency, is accorded relief from the element of customs duty and VAT which is incorporated in the price of petrol bought by him in this country. This provision is included to implement Article XV of the Annex to the European Space Agency Convention, which obliges us to grant to the Director General privileges and immunities comparable to those given to a diplomatic agent.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A diplomat in this country is entitled to relief from duty on petrol if he buys it for his personal use, or that of his family members, or for official use. Article 15(1)(<i>d</i>) of the draft Order does not contain any such qualifying condition."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman has been very fair about this. I continue to quote from our note to his Committee:
<br><blockquote><p>"The reason for this is that this Article provides that relief is to be granted "—</p></blockquote>
as he put it—
<br><blockquote><p>"' subject to compliance with such conditions as may be imposed'. It is these conditions which set the requirement that the Director General must use the petrol himself if he is to claim relief for it. They are specifically referred to in the official memorandum agreed "—</p></blockquote>
as the right hon. Gentleman acknowledges—
<br><blockquote><p>"between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise on diplomatic privileges and immunities."</p></blockquote>
The relevant extract from this memorandum we shall be attaching to our submission.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman also drew attention to the wording on the form. The standard claim form used by persons
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1977-1978V004P0I1200">Image</span>

claiming relief contains, as he indicated, the following certification:
<br><blockquote><p>"I certify that the items covered by this claim were purchased for the use of privileged members of the staff of this organisation".</p></blockquote>
The note continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a fundamental principle, which is evident in all areas of law concerning privileges and immunities, that no person who is not entitled to them himself should be able to benefit from the privileges and immunities accorded to other persons. It is in accordance with this principle that Article 15(1)(<i>d</i>) of this draft Order has to be interpreted."</p></blockquote>
I would only emphasise, in quoting that note, that the only privileged member of the ESA who will be entitled to hydrocarbon oil relief is the one top official, the Director-General. Therefore, in our view, the form does cover the point at issue..</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hurd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister has not answered satisfactorily the crucial point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) on procedure. He has not covered the argument that the House of Commons is not able to debate this Instrument and therefore is not able to take account of any comments which the Joint Committee may make on it. It is for this Committee to take account of the views of the Joint Committee. But we do not have the views of the Joint Committee. It seems to me that the procedure is mocked if we take the reports the wrong way round and if this Committee is asked to make a judgment on this order before the Committee under the chairmanship of my right hon. Friend has completed its work.<br><br>
I understand that the Foreign Office likes to empty its "in" trays at this time of year, but the Minister has not been able to produce an argument of national interest, although my right hon. Friend gave him the opportunity, to demonstrate that a judgment on the order is required today. It seems important that we should stick to our procedures and to the method of doing things which the House has established for its own protection and for the protection of the system.<br><br>
I would therefore like to move, Mr. Watkins, if you will accept the motion, that this Committee resumes consideration of this Statutory Instrument when we are in possession of the Joint Committee's report.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Judd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that I have a great deal of sympathy with the force of the argument being put by the Opposition. However, I feel that it should be on record that I am not just saying for the sake of saying it that there will be no question of the order being put before the House before the Committee of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has had the opportunity to comment. I am saying that because, of course, we take extremely seriously, and I shall personally take extremely seriously, any comments which he wishes to make. But I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the views which he and his hon. Friends have advanced will be put fairly and squarely to my colleagues with responsibility for business management in the House of Commons. I believe that they are serious points.<br><br>
As for the issue at stake, I hope that the little debate that we have been able to have this morning in which the right hon. Gentleman, with his characteristic skill has put the arguments very well, has enabled us to explain why we believe that he should feel reassured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Mid-Oxon (Mr. Hurd) has moved a motion to adjourn the Committee. He has put it in certain terms. Would he be prepared to put it in terms to the effect that the Committee might resume next Wednesday morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hurd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of my motion was that we should resume when we were in possession of the Joint Committee's report. I am not quite sure when, in realistic terms, that will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I might interrupt my hon. Friend. The Joint Committee will be considering this matter next Tuesday so that if this Committee met on Wednesday it could have the report of the Joint Committee at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hurd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. Watkins, I would like to move the motion in the form you have suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am accepting the motion in the terms moved and it is, of course, debatable..</span></p>
