	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first item of business this morning is a statement on the veterans initiative. There is no time limit on the statement and the subsequent questions, but I will have regard to the main item of business, which must end at 1 o'clock, when I decide whether to call hon. Members to put further questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Adams. Your statement that there is no time limit on questions—or on the length or breadth of them, no doubt—is most daunting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pleasure to have the chance to make a statement on veterans' responsibilities. We do not get many opportunities to speak on the subject. I thought that it would be useful to let colleagues know what we have been up to in the past six months, and what we propose to do in future. Although the Ministry of Defence is heavily involved in overseas operations, the Committee will hear a briefing on health, social and education issues, rather than one on asymmetrical warfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The veterans initiative arose from one of the wider themes of Parliament—public sector reform aimed at achieving a joined-up approach and an integrated policy across Government. Until now, the concerns of veterans have been dealt with on a single-issue basis by the Department responsible, or by local government. That trend was exacerbated by recent constitutional changes, which have increased the diversity of devolved Governments and local government. That diversity has increased the risk of variable delivery of public service benefits to veterans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister appointed me as the Minister responsible for veterans' affairs to ensure a more integrated approach to veterans' issues, and to ensure that those issues are properly understood, appropriately prioritised and effectively addressed across Government. The veterans initiative will not encroach on the responsibilities of the devolved Administrations, but my remit covers veterans from all four nations. The veterans' community has made it clear that they expect an even-handed and consistent approach throughout the United Kingdom from Government, local government and the devolved Administrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister's appointment of a veterans' champion in Government demonstrates that we recognise the special status of the ex-service community, and the unique contribution that it has made to the defence of the United Kingdom. To continue that work effectively, I need to plan a strategy with my ministerial colleagues on the veterans' taskforce that I set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The taskforce is supported by a veterans' forum, which works with representatives from veterans' organisations throughout the country, in particular, the executive committee of the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations. It is also supported by officials from Government Departments that have an interest in veterans' affairs, such as the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Skills, and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the official side, Scotland's interests are covered by Eric Miller from the Scotland Office, and Linda Rosborough from the Scottish Executive. The representative from the voluntary sector is Major General John MacDonald, the General Secretary of the Scottish Ex-Service Charitable Organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The taskforce is made up of interested Ministers from throughout Government and the devolved Administrations, including the Minister of State, Scotland Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), and Margaret Curran, the Scottish Executive's Deputy Minister for Social Justice. Also on the taskforce are two senior members of the veterans' community, the chairmen of COBSEO and the general secretary of the Royal British Legion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The taskforce has agreed three main priorities for the initiative. First, it must pull together the Government's response to issues that cut across Government Departments, such as the assistance that is provided to tackle homelessness or ill health. Secondly, it must ensure that lessons are learned and absorbed into the Ministry of Defence's planning. The MOD must ensure that it has the right preventive measures in place in order to minimise later problems, such as service lost through injury and illness, and to respond adequately to the challenges of operational stress and resettlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third priority is to co-ordinate communication by publicising and demonstrating the full range of help offered to veterans by central and local government. Veterans' organisations have the opportunity to represent their collective and individual anxieties to the Government at ministerial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Adjournment debate on veterans' affairs that was held on 8 May and initiated by the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly), now Economic Secretary to the Treasury, provided us with a reminder of the wide range of problems that need to be tackled. The issues raised provided the taskforce with a remit for the veterans initiative to cover pensions, homelessness, post-traumatic stress, access to health care, family breakdown, poor employment skills, criminal behaviour, substance abuse, war graves and the widespread anxiety that the sacrifices made by veterans and their dependants has been forgotten. It is amazing how much one can get through in an Adjournment debate. The debate convinced me of the need to make help for the most vulnerable veterans a priority, and showed how important it was to win the commitment of ministerial and parliamentary colleagues in achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The agenda for the veterans initiative has been developed by a strategic action group, largely within the Ministry of Defence, set up by the deputy Chief of Defence Staff with responsibility for personnel, Air Marshal Sir Malcolm Pledger. Its goal was to develop a cross-Government action plan that would raise the profile of veterans' issues in Government and improve the delivery of benefits to veterans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of what I am discussing must seem very bureaucratic and organisation-based. In fact, it shows that we had no proper structure for dealing with such issues, and highlights the complexity of trying to set up the initiative. The initiative, which is being repeated in many other Departments, shows how difficult and complex it is to get everyone together to begin discussing and dealing with a subject. Although my comments make it seem like a very bureaucratic system, I assure hon. Members that it is not. There is no other way to put in place the infrastructure to produce the improvement in services that we hope to achieve through the initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Helping vulnerable people has been one of the Government's key priorities since the 1997 election, as the creation of the Cabinet Office's social exclusion unit shows. The strategic planning group referred to the special report produced by the better regulation taskforce in September 2000, which was entitled "Protecting Vulnerable People". A key concern was to identify any circumstances relating to service life that were driving the problems of ex-service personnel, and to deal with them. The job of the taskforce is to focus on the need for regulation or support that would remove or mitigate the root cause of the vulnerability—for example, providing access to expert mental health care for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or preventing veterans from falling into social exclusion as they make the step back into civilian life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another priority is to protect from harm vulnerable veterans such as those who are about to be released following a prison term. Departments should work much more closely with veterans charities on that. We must also examine how vulnerable veterans can be provided with support when full independence cannot be achieved. Much is already in place through the work of the Ministry of Defence's War Pensions Agency, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health. However, particular issues should be dealt with, such as the impact of recent changes in regulation on the economics of long-term residential care. Benefit providers such as the Department for Work and Pensions need to examine aspects such as access to information, advice and guidance, access to complaints procedures, and redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My taskforce colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), put the aim of the veterans initiative in a nutshell, when she said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the lead Department should focus on understanding the factors driving the client group's vulnerability and identifying ways of mitigating the vulnerability. It will be the MoD's responsibility to provide prevention measures."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
That partnership approach is best exemplified by the recent achievements of the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and its rough sleepers unit, the voluntary sector and the MOD, which have been working together to meet the target of reducing the number of rough sleepers by two thirds by April 2002. Meeting that public services agreement target has involved DTLR-sponsored legislation, the development of new definitions of vulnerability by the Cabinet Office, joint investment in new sheltered housing accommodation by the Government and veterans' benevolent funds, and the MOD improving our resettlement procedures. Similar partnerships must be considered to reduce veterans' vulnerability in matters such as mental health, other types of social exclusion, and long-term care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategic action plan that has been developed to take that work forward was endorsed by the 156 delegates who attended the first meeting of the veterans' forum, in its plenary session, on 16 October. That group of delegates represented a broad cross-section of the veterans' community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small output-focused working groups are being established to take the action plan forward. They have clearly defined terms of reference, and they are focused on the key deliverables. They will be chaired by an expert from the Government Department with the lead responsibility for policy, or by the most appropriate representative from the voluntary sector. This is not merely an intra-Government initiative; wherever possible, we are involving people from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are nine working groups. The people who are chairing them have been asked to produce progress reports and presentations in time for the next major meetings—of the forum in April 2002, and of the taskforce in May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to driving our agenda forward, I wish briefly to describe what we want the committees to do. We are seeking to set the scene for a broad and effective long-term agenda. Our aims cannot be achieved by implementing a series of one-off measures within a six-month agenda. The key issues are too complex to be adequately addressed in that way. They can be dealt with only if they become an integral part of day-to-day policy development and service delivery. Success will be achieved only if the requirement to be responsive to veterans' needs and concerns is embedded in Government thinking at a strategic level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the best ways of achieving that aim is to focus on the public service agreement targets. I assure hon. Members that, at this stage, the objective is not to obtain agreement on specific measures to assist veterans, or to single veterans out for special treatment. Their problems, and the causes of those problems, are the same as those of the rest of the population. We want Departments to review their public service agreements to identify areas where they suspect that there might be a significant and discrete veterans' element. Where such a problem is identified—as, for example, among rough sleepers—officials should work together to develop solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The aim of the first working group will be to lead a strategic cross-Government review to identify areas where the successful delivery of public service agreement targets is dependant upon addressing a significant and discrete veterans' issue. Where such an issue is identified, the next step will be to establish specific initiatives to address those veterans' needs. That work will be undertaken in partnership with interested parties, both within Government and outside, and the solutions should address both immediate mitigation of the problem, and the root causes in service life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good partnership cannot be built without good communication. The second working group will carry out a study that aims to improve communication with the 13 million members of the veterans' community. The study will build on the initiative of the Department for Work and Pensions to clarify and maintain the Government's communication with older people, and on the work of the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions to examine ways of maintaining contact and communication with hard-to-reach groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third working group has been asked to produce recommendations on ways to do more to increase recognition of the special status of veterans, as a group to whom society owes a debt. The feasibility of introducing a veterans' identity card is one of the options that will be explored; we hope that that might promote an esprit de corps among veterans, and improve their access to better financial deals and other benefits that such cards offer—as has been shown by the experience in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth group has been asked to find ways of increasing recognition of the contribution and achievements of veterans through education. That objective is particularly relevant with regard to young people; it is important to try to show them the part that veterans have played in maintaining national and international security. Such education would provide an opportunity to highlight the many achievements of our armed forces in recent times. In practical terms, we are trying to co-ordinate the development of work material for the new key stage 3 scheme for citizenship that will be part of the national curriculum from September 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance produced by the Department for Education and Skills encourages schools to use history to develop pupils' ideas of citizenship, including their understanding of the institutions that support democracy. That presents an excellent opportunity for the veterans' organisations to provide an example of citizenship in action, both in written material and, perhaps, through providing volunteers to act as classroom helpers at junior and secondary level. The objective is to ensure that new generations have a proper understanding of what the armed forces have contributed to our society's well-being. It should cover the contribution of Commonwealth forces, which is often forgotten, and should help to improve the identification of ethnic minorities with the work of the armed forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The fifth working group covers similar ground. It will produce recommendations on how to give greater recognition to some of the more recent achievements of the armed forces with which members of the younger generation can more readily identify, given that they have little direct experience within their families of service in the armed forces. That will help to redress the widespread impression that veterans and what we celebrate as our military history are overwhelmingly about the first and second world wars. To ensure that the initiative continues to focus on the key concerns of veterans, we have applied to the Treasury for support from the evidence-based policy fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the sixth working group is to commission and oversee research that will provide data on the key areas of unresolved vulnerability and the factors that determine it. It should also provide evidence to support decisions about where effort and investment could be more productively targeted. One of the most productive areas for preventive measures is at the point when service personnel make the transition back into civilian life. The present resettlement arrangements are good at helping those who have had a successful military career, but perhaps not nearly so good for those who have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the seventh working group is to consider ways in which to provide those more vulnerable to social exclusion, such as people who are compulsorily discharged, with improved resettlement advice to reduce the risk that they compound their failure by failing to make a successful transition to civilian life. That advice will include individual advice to improve the likelihood of such individuals' finding and holding down a job, finding and sustaining a home and finding further help should the initial assistance not be sufficient. The intention is to provide specifically trained dedicated consultants who would operate from the 10 regional resettlement centres and provide advice and signposting to improve the likelihood of a successful transition. That will be linked to the special mentoring service that will be provided by the Department for Work and Pensions under the new jobcentre plus arrangements and to the existing services provided by the ex-service charities. I have asked that the scheme be made sufficiently flexible to enable deferred or perhaps repeat access by veterans returning from a period of social exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eighth working group will provide the key veterans' organisations with the opportunity of further consultation on the outcome of compensation and pension reviews before any final decisions are taken on the way ahead. The ninth working group will provide advice and guidance on improving the long-term care that is provided to veterans. One of the most pressing problems for the ex-service community is the increasing demand for places in long-term residential care homes for elderly and disabled veterans at a time when capacity is falling due to increasing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position seems to have been exacerbated by the introduction of higher standards under the Care Standards Act 2000. I have asked colleagues at the Department of Health to provide a chair for a working group to look into the matter and provide advice and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
guidance on what action might be taken by the veterans' organisations that provide residential care, to enable them to meet the challenge presented by the Act and to help them to respond to a growing population of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The veterans' community has made it clear that it is expecting an even-handed and consistent approach throughout the United Kingdom. I am pleased to tell the Committee that, at the taskforce meeting, Margaret Curran said that the Scottish Executive would, in turn, convene a special meeting with Scottish veterans' organisations and local authorities to agree how to take the initiative forward in Scotland. She also made the point that, although the Scottish curriculum was structured differently, teachers' learning packs could be used by Scottish schools at the appropriate time to deliver the same objective. Margaret Curran offered to conduct a trawl to identify the particular health issues that are considered significant by Scottish veterans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may not be surprised that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Defence and I frequently meet representatives of those who are currently serving as well as representatives of veterans in Scotland, so there is no shortage of opportunities for them to convey their views to us. I must say that they take advantage of those opportunities whenever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, perhaps, said enough, although I could cover other matters such as war graves, especially at sea—the Committee will know that we are dealing with that from press reports—Gulf veterans' illnesses and medals. Hon. Members receive regular correspondence about those issues. I will be pleased to answer questions on such matters, but I thought that I would provide a simple framework. We are doing as much as possible for this valued group in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Carmichael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Adams. I ask for your guidance about the context of the Minister's statement. I have consulted page 716 of 	<i>Erskine May.</i> Under the heading "Ministerial Statements", it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"statements may be made … to facilitate questioning on matters relating to the Minister's official responsibilities in so far as they relate to Scotland".</p></blockquote>
It seemed to me that much of what the Minister said was more general and widespread, and did not relate only to Scotland. I should be grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Adams, especially as we develop the debate. This Committee is one of the remaining ways in which Scottish Members may hold the Executive to account, and there should be more focus on Scotland than was in the Minister's statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take note of the objections. I remind hon. Members that any questions should relate to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the courtesy that he paid by sending me a copy of the statement. I listened especially attentively to what he said, because I realised that only about a third of the statement came through on the fax, so the latter two-thirds were
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
a revelation. I hope that that is not an example of asymmetric warfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the Minister in paying tribute to Scottish veterans. Scotland has a particularly proud tradition of sending more than its quota of people to serve the country. It is appropriate that we should look after our veterans. I congratulate the Minister on the broad thrust of his statement. It would be difficult to take issue with him on any measure that will help to improve the lot of veterans in Scotland. Does he agree, however, that it is a stain on our record that the problems of mental health and homelessness of veterans received such poor attention, especially throughout the 1980s?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a personal interest in war pensions, because my mother's first husband was killed in the war and she did not receive a pension for many years. However, a pension was made available to her through the good offices of the Royal British Legion. Will the Minister join me in paying tribute to the work of the Royal British Legion in Scotland and the Earl Haig fund, especially on war widows' pensions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick the Minister up on one or two points. He mentioned ID cards for veterans. I understand what he and his Department are trying to do, but he will recognise that Liberal Democrats always view ID cards with caution. Will he ensure that the benefits of ID cards will not be associated with the disadvantages and discrimination that could come from not having a card?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the Minister's reference to Commonwealth soldiers. We often forget the debt that we owe to many Commonwealth soldiers who now live in Scotland, and we should look after them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister examine the cases of the men who were shot at dawn? He did not mention that issue, but a number of my constituents have relatives who were very young when they were shot during the first world war. In Scotland, I believe that the Executive has issued something approaching a pardon, but I understand that the Ministry of Defence does not feel able to look into those cases. There are only 300 cases, and I urge the Minister to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On pensions, I can only agree with the hon. Gentleman. The Royal British Legion, in Scotland and nationally, and the Earl Haig fund in Scotland play a significant part in looking after the interests of veterans, as does the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association locally. That organisation stretches throughout Scotland and we hope to make much better use of the support that it gives at community level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On ID cards, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will take the greatest care in setting up the scheme. At the least, it would be a hollow benefit to veterans if all that they got was another card to put in their wallet. We are considering the possible benefits. It is important to learn from overseas examples of veterans' services—we need not sit down with a blank sheet of paper and reinvent the wheel. Much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
has been done in varied ways in Australia, Canada and the United States, although the sheer size of the United States dwarfs anything that other countries are likely to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, North and Bellshill (Dr. Reid), who is now Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, considered in great detail the subject of those who were shot at dawn during the first world war. Although we have a great deal of sympathy with the arguments that have been expressed, we have so far felt unable to make further change beyond the large steps that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions, neither of which the Minister can answer off the top of his head. The first is on war graves. Last year, my wife and I visited the war cemetery in Crete, where, incidentally, there are a lot of Scots—the Cameronians, the Camerons, the Gordons and the Argylls—at Suda bay. It was well kept and the Cretan officials were helpful. A couple of days later, we visited the German paratroopers cemetery at Maleme. It was absolutely superb. An exhibition explained exactly what had happened, in sensible terms, and pictures were displayed. Frankly, the British cemetery was not a patch on the cemetery for the German paratroopers who landed at Crete. Can inquiries be made to see whether our cemetery can be brought up to the standard of the German cemetery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Tripoli, which I visited two years ago, the British cemetery has been allowed to deteriorate. There was nothing that we could have done about it. However, I should like to congratulate the War Graves Commission, through the Minister, on the way in which it has tried to retrieve the situation, which is to its enormous credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my second question, I hope that I shall be forgiven, as I suppose that I am the only veteran here, for talking rather emotionally. A number of my contemporaries in basic training at Catterick went off to Korea and were shot up with the 8th Hussars when their tank tracks were stuck in the Korean mud. It was a sad episode. Partly as a result of all that, as the Minister may know, and as the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) certainly knows, there is a tree memorial near Torphichen in West Lothian to those who suffered in the Korean war. Only yesterday, I approached the Chancellor in relation to Colonel Johnny Johnston's concerns about that. I shall not bore the Committee with the ins and outs of the matter, but there is a great deal of upset that it is being charged on. The amount is £4,000 or £5,000, but to that kind of charity such a sum makes a difference. I did not realise that the statement was being made this morning; otherwise, I would have had the details with me. A detailed letter went to the Treasury only yesterday. Will the Minister approach the Treasury to see what can be done in relation to the Korean memorial forest at Torphichen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a valid point on the war graves issue. Where historical information facilities have been set up, they are well used, particularly in Normandy. I recently attended a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
ceremony at the Menin gate in Ypres. Extensive work has been done there, and at other sites such as Belsen in Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of recognising the importance of those sites, but rather of where one stops. Is it a basic principle that every site should have informative or educative material available? I would be happy to discuss that with colleagues. Clearly, graveyards such as the one in Narvik, which I visited last year, provide a focus for visitors' attention. Perhaps we should be doing more to provide recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of war graves on our own soil, for which the War Graves Commission is not responsible. We are trying to find resources, and I think that we will be successful in improving the way in which we should look after those graves. I have an open mind on this issue. We provide the majority of funding for the War Graves Commission, and it is put to excellent use. There is, however, little surplus, and perhaps we should look wider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will be happy to look into the second point that my hon. Friend raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for forwarding the statement. I received a complete copy—although it blocked the fax machine for most of the morning—and it was most welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Minister's contribution with great interest, and would welcome any initiative that benefits the many veterans who served this country with so much distinction. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is not before time. I am certain that he will have examined how other countries deal with their veterans' affairs and co-ordinate matters. The irony—which is probably not lost on the hon. Gentleman—is that many of the countries we fought in the second world war, particularly Germany, have the best funded veteran support services. It is a shame that the initiative has taken so long, but I do not want to be churlish and diminish my welcome for it.
I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on three issues, about which I suspect most hon. Members will have received correspondence. Does he anticipate that the initiative will contain or address any of the following matters? I refer first to the armed forces pension. I am certain that the Minister has received, as I have, many letters and surgery visits from constituents who served—or whose partners or relatives served—in the armed forces prior to the 1970s. They are not entitled to pensions because they, or their partners or relatives, served for less than 22 years. Will that pensions and compensation form any part of the veterans initiative?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter concerns compensation for prisoners of war. Some days ago, the Minister confirmed that the 1,102 claims for compensation from people who served in the British armed forces and were in Japanese prisoner of war camps were rejected. How many of those claims were from Scottish people, or people living in Scotland, who should have received compensation? Will that issue be taken up in the context of the veterans initiative?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Thirdly, following up a point made by a number of hon. Members about Commonwealth veterans, will Ghurkha ex-service men's pension rights also be looked into under the aegis of the veterans initiative? I look forward to the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association, the Royal British Legion, and other veterans' organisations, expressing their views. I hope that they will do so, and that hon. Members will feed that information through to the Minister—although I am sure that he will also receive direct representations. I also look forward to hearing progress reports from the Minister on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that last point. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) questioned whether my statement was in order. I read the statement carefully before I delivered it to ensure that it was, as far as possible, in order. When the hon. Gentleman reads it, he may decide that it is more relevant than he initially thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative is intended to be as inclusive as possible. Every hon. Member meets veterans' organisations in their constituencies, and if issues of concern are raised with them, I want them to bring them to my attention. The fact that we have set up the structure that I have described does not alter the fact that any hon. Member can bring such an issue to my attention at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could talk all morning about pension levels—suddenly, there is a look of horror on my right. I started working in the 1960s, when it was common for employment not to be pensioned. Such practice was not the unique preserve of the armed forces, but the impact of that was particularly great on people who left the forces early. Pensions were not portable; there was no facility for people to take them with them. If people had served for less than a certain period of time, they could withdraw their contributions, otherwise they had to leave them and there was no facility for withdrawing them or for continuing to make them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have sympathy for people in that situation, they chose to enter that employment in the full knowledge that it was not pensionable unless they stayed for the full length of time. That would be the case in almost any other organisation that one could name. The cost of making any sort of recompense— even if we felt that that was necessary—would be prohibitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now discuss the POW compensation. I have listened carefully to the complaints that have been made. Regarding such schemes, one instinctively feels sorry for people who have been excluded. When we first addressed the matter, we thought of taking as our starting point the group of people who were compensated in the 1950s by the Japanese, but we subsequently decided to broaden that—to include children, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original test of Britishness was, in effect, whether someone had gone to war from these islands, and whether they returned here afterwards. Only people who returned received the compensation. We thought that that was wrong, and that the definition should be wider. That is why we
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
introduced the test of whether a parent or grandparent had been born in this country. I do not consider that to be an unreasonable test—it means that a relative was born in this country in the late 1800s. That is a fair test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of nationality has greatly changed since the second world war: for example, people whose families had worked in India for five or six generations might have retained their British passports, but their links with these islands were tenuous at best. We have struck a balance between leaving the test open to anyone who can claim a relationship with this country at any time—which obviously would not have been sensible—and the over-restrictive provisions of the 1950s compensation scheme. It is difficult to see what more we could do at this stage. Although I think that we have been reasonable, I am sure that I will receive many more representations on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is welcome that the Minister recognises the importance of the role that veterans have played in ensuring that hon. Members are here today, and that we are all able to get on with our lives. It is also important to highlight the fact that veterans do not date only from first world war and the second world war; there are veterans of the many conflicts since then, and of all the services that the armed forces have provided in times of peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to go to the nub of the pension issue. It would be welcome if the Minister could sort out bureaucracy and joined-up government. However, is the Treasury willing, if some of the solutions have resource implications, to allow him to tap into resources to provide those solutions? Many veteran pensioners feel frustration because the House retrospectively sorts out the pension problems of Members. That creates a sense of grievance among veterans, who think it a matter of principle, as there is no retrospective way of dealing with their pension problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister considers the issue of war graves at sea, will he be sensitive and recognise that the vast number of recreational wreck divers show great respect for the wrecks that they visit? Without those divers, many war graves would not have been found. When wreck diving is done carefully and sensitively, it can form an important part of the local economy for some parts of Scotland. It is an attraction for tourism and visitors. I hope that the Minister takes a balanced view and recognises that the majority of wreck divers are responsible and well behaved citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a chunk at the end of my speech that I did not deliver. Part of the missing bit was about war graves, no doubt. It was decided that I would not expand my speech to apply to any other issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, I changed the policy on war graves, and implemented the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to designate 16 vessels as controlled sites on which no diving is allowed without a licence. I did so because of the great loss of life that accompanied the wrecking and foundering of those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
vessels. Other wrecks will be designated protected places, and people will be asked to respect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is analogous to taking a walk in a churchyard and looking at the graves there. None of us would chip bits off the stones and take them away. Similarly, wreck sites represent the graves of our fellow men and women, and divers should treat them with respect. The vast majority of divers are respectable, decent citizens who enjoy their dive and leave without doing any harm. A small number of people will never respect anything, and the 1986 Act is intended to deal with them. I hope that those people are reported; I guarantee that they will be prosecuted if evidence is produced to support the claim that they desecrated one of the graves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Thank you, Mrs. Adams. This is the first time that I have appeared in Scottish Grand Committee under your chairmanship. This is an important point in history; it is the first time that a woman has chaired the Grand Committee and a woman Secretary of State has appeared before her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome Members who are attending their first sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee, which is an important forum for set-piece debates on reserved issues as they affect Scotland. In the previous Parliament, the Scottish Grand Committee debated subjects ranging from energy to poverty and the new deal. Today we are discussing veterans and, in the Adjournment debates, Scotland's place in the world and the Grangemouth refinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous debate was interesting. As we consider Scotland's place in the world, we should remember that much ofScotland's progress is due to the sacrifice made by others, and we should bear that in mind, particularly in this month of November. I am glad that we have had the opportunity to hear a statement from the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie).

Many hon. Members joined me last night at the Banqueting house, where we celebrated St. Andrew's day a little early. I spoke there about my initiative to promote Scotland in the world, and to reach out to friends of Scotland who live overseas. We can sell Scotland in the world in the global marketplace only if our fundamentals are strong. The devolution settlement, which was secured by the Government, is a constitutional foundation that is unquestionably strong.

I am proud to report that despite a worldwide downturn and the impact of the events of 11 September, the economies of the United Kingdom and Scotland remain robust. We are in a difficult global situation and it is reassuring that our economy is outperforming its competitors. Thanks to the tough and prudent decisions taken by the Government, we have a lower unemployment rate than other G7 countries for the first time in a century. Growth is forecast to remain strong and steady and, given that growth in other countries is limited, it is a remarkable achievement that growth in the United Kingdom will be between 2 and 2.5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday, the Chancellor said that he expected the United Kingdom's growth to be 2.25 per cent. What does the Secretary of State expect Scotland's rate of growth to be this year? Will it be over or under 1 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Recent commentary has suggested that growth will be less than 1 per cent. However, I am reassured by the fact that the Scottish economy outperforms major economies such as Japan's, which has record negative growth of 0.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not join us last night. I am not surprised that he could not, and I missed his company. He would have loathed it, because it was an opportunity to enjoy Scotland's success. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] We all know that the hon. Gentleman enjoys nothing more than a good whinge, but the Scottish economy is performing well. Unemployment in Scotland is at its lowest level for 25 years, employment is at its highest level for 40 years and interest rates are at an historic low. That may stick in the hon. Gentleman's craw, but it means that many Scots are more prosperous with a Labour Government than they would have been with any of the cack-handed plans of the Scottish National party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Due to the usual wrath of the Secretary of State and her cheerleaders behind, I missed some of what she said. She admitted that growth in the Scottish economy will be under 1 per cent. compared with 2.25 per cent. in the United Kingdom—that is less than half. Did she actually say, as Secretary of State for Scotland, that that means that the Scottish economy is performing well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen to other people rather than to his own ranting and raving. He does not like to hear good news. If he wants to make a constructive contribution to the economy of Scotland, he should devote his attention to how we can improve output in Scotland and how our new economy can grow internationally. He should examine how our biotechnology can produce more than the 30 per cent. growth that it enjoys in Europe. Instead, the Scottish nationalists whinge for Scotland. The Minister of State has told me that they were whinging in Westminster Hall, and they are whinging here now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy is performing well. The hon. Gentleman can talk to people who have jobs now who did not previously. Unemployment in his constituency is at a record low, and employment is at a record high.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The hon. Gentleman should reflect on that before he carries on whinging for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland's place in the world in the third year of devolution is firmly within the United Kingdom. That was overwhelmingly reconfirmed by the people of Scotland during the general election, and there is no doubt that Scotland thrives in the United Kingdom, despite these unsettled times following 11 September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has changed spectacularly in recent years. The Government have transformed the economy as we transformed the constitution. Those forces have combined to create a fresh and invigorating atmosphere in Scotland, and give us a new perspective on Scotland's place in the world. We will seize the chance to promote the new Scotland as a stronger part of a stronger United Kingdom. Devolution helps to highlight the dynamism and diversity not only of Scotland, but of the whole of the United Kingdom. It opens cultural and economic benefits that are brought by widespread international recognition. We use Scotland's place in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom's worldwide diplomatic and commercial contacts to maximise those benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key element of devolution has been the partnership between the Government and the Scottish Executive. Together we can present a picture to the world of a country at ease with itself and its neighbours: a partnership of Parliaments that will continue to thrive under the new leadership at Holyrood. The Government are committed to partnership, but not just partnership within the United Kingdom. We have transformed the United Kingdom's influence in Europe through constructive engagement. As with our constitutional changes at home, we seek reform to make the European Union deliver more effectively for all its people. Our commitment to make the EU more responsive is driving our contribution to the debate on the future of Europe that was launched at the Nice European Council last December, and which will culminate in the intergovernmental conference in 2004.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Secretary of State is talking about the debate on the future of Europe, can she confirm that representatives of the Scottish Executive will be part of the British delegation at the conference—or not, as has happened at the majority of European meetings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Union has rules about who attends meetings. The Scottish Executive have been represented at the European Council on many occasions. They have also led for the United Kingdom several times, two of which have been on education. I shall give the hon. Gentleman the details: on 24 and 25 September 1999, they led for the United Kingdom at the informal meeting of Ministers on education; on 26 October and 22 November, they met on fisheries; on 13 December, they met on the environment and on 14 December, they met on agriculture. Does the hon. Gentleman want me to detail what happened in 2000 and 2001? [	<i>Interruption</i>.] Yes, he would like me to take up the Committee's time because he does not want to hear about Scotland's success in the world. That is a typical nationalist response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
We must take a constructive attitude towards Europe, but we must also be realistic about the extent to which the European Union needs to change. It must be seen as much more relevant to the people of the European Union. We are working to achieve reforms in Europe that will be of great value to Scotland. The Lisbon summit in March 2000 was important in developing information technology, communications technology and the reform of the labour market, which are all elements that we need to secure if we are to improve Scottish productivity and Scotland's position in the European Union and international markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
International relations is a reserve matter under the Scotland Act 1998. Notwithstanding that, the Government have secured a good and positive relationship with the Scottish Executive. We must use the facilities that they have established in Scotland house in Brussels, and if members of the Committee take the opportunity to visit the institutions of the European Union, I advise them to call into Scotland house. It is a most impressive operation. I was delighted to see it represented last night. It is important that we have a voice in Brussels on exclusively Scottish matters as well those that have an impact on reserve areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about our place in the wider world? Despite being a small nation on the edge of Europe, we have long had an important position in the world. From that small corner of the globe have come some great scientists, engineers, doctors, writers and educators. Those members of the Committee who last night saw the video about our history, the present day and the future will know that we still lead the world in innovation in many areas. We helped to make the world a smaller place by improving the speed of communication. We gave the world the television and the telephone as well as the video recorder and the fax machine, which unfortunately did not work so well for the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). We have made the world go faster. We invented road surfaces and the bicycle. We did not invent the wheel, but we put a rubber tyre on it. There was even a Scot on the Starship Enterprise, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, is of Scots descent. Our achievements in medicine and biotechnology are well known to Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we need to continue to forge new links and seek new leadership in the world. The instinct to look outward is reflected in the sense of internationalism that has come from the Scottish people, as well as a concern for the downtrodden, which shines through our history. Our history as a trading nation encouraged cultural, social, academic and economic exchanges, which continue today. We must now work on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, we reflected on some of the changes of which many Scots are often not aware. Our electronics industry produces 80 per cent, of Europe's workstations. In financial services, we rank no. 4 in international funds under management. Our cashmere knitwear and Harris Tweed grace the world's catwalks, and our biotechnology sector is growing at 30 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
a year, which is double the rate of any other country in Europe, and it can go further. That is what we must address, and we must do so positively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish exports in 1999 were at a record level of almost £28 billion. However, there have been mixed fortunes for our manufacturing sector. Despite that, we continue to outperform the rest of the United Kingdom in manufacturing exports, with Scotland's share rising to 12.4 per cent., which is a record for the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have an excellent record in attracting direct investment from abroad. More than 1,000 investors are located in Scotland, and last year Locate in Scotland, which is now called Scottish Development International and has an office in Dover house—we would be delighted to meet hon. Members who have constituency interests in inward investment—helped to attract projects valued at almost £1.8 billion. That created 14,000 jobs for Scots in Scotland. Even in these more difficult times, new inward investments continue to be announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the first year of the new century has not been the best for our tourism industry—not just because of foot-and-mouth disease but the impact of 11 September. In 1999, the Scottish tourism industry supported 193,000 Scottish jobs. It deserves our serious attention. However, there is also good news. As I mentioned at Scottish questions a couple of weeks ago, Scottish airports seem to be bucking the trend. Glasgow Prestwick recorded a massive 20 per cent. increase in passenger numbers during October compared with that month last year. In September, it was 37.9 per cent. up. There were increases of 13 per cent. at Edinburgh, and 6.5 per cent. at Glasgow. That is a remarkable performance, much of which was led by the strength of the no-frills sectors. That shows that there is still strong demand for air travel to and from Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Barrett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Airports in Edinburgh and Glasgow may be bucking the trend in the numbers of flights, but the lack of direct international flights from those airports has been adversely affected since 11 September. I agree about the increase in low-cost flights, but there must be improved transport links to the rest of the world. Will the Secretary of State address that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. In fact, I was just about to say that next week I am hosting a summit of the entire airline industry in my offices in Edinburgh, with a view to addressing some of those issues. It had been planned prior to 11 September but had to be postponed because the nature of the airline industry changed so dramatically as a result. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman that there must be more direct flights to and from Scottish airports. That is important not only for tourism, but for industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the Scottish Executive's work on tourism, which is supported by my Department, VisitScotland is increasing its marketing efforts. It is moving into niche marketing of Scotland. Only last
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
week, the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, who joined us last night, launched a new action plan for the industry aimed at transforming tourism in Scotland not just on the basis of the product—which we all know is of extremely high quality—but in terms of communication, access, technology, quality, skills, training, infrastructure and service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Begg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the Minister said about meeting the airline industry. When she does so next week, will she ask the airline companies that are withdrawing some of their charter flights—especially from Aberdeen and Edinburgh—as a result of the implications of 11 September, to ensure that any alternative arrangements put in place are not at the extra cost of travellers who have already booked their flights or holidays?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I shall discuss it with the industry. I shall also mention it to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who will have an interest in the matter, and I will report to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key aim of VisitScotland is to build a strong brand. The entire industry needs to embrace the changes required to allow Scottish tourism to compete at its highest level, as does the United Kingdom. I keep in close contact with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and my colleagues in the Scottish Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spend a lot of time speaking to people from throughout the world about Scotland, and when I do so I can tell a tale of much greater vibrancy and vigour in Scotland. As you know, Mrs. Adams, I have spent much of the past month visiting our famous towns that are now applying for city status—Ayr, Dumfries and Stirling—and I hope by the end of the week to visit Paisley. When speaking to young people and those involved in promoting their towns for city status, one cannot fail to be impressed by the self-confidence and vitality. It is catching, even in some of our more sober institutions. Banks and other big financial companies are throwing off the cobwebs that have perhaps been associated with them in the past, and meeting the demands of the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great flowering of determination, energy and vision, and that is the Scotland of tomorrow. I believe passionately that we need to tell the world about it, and I want to do just that—to get out there and spread the message about that new Scotland. I cannot do so all by myself. A resource is out there—a massive army—that we have never properly accessed. Tens of millions of people throughout the world describe themselves as Scottish. In the United States alone, 11 million people describe themselves as Scottish when asked their nationality. That is more than twice the number of people who live in Scotland. We should use that resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am working closely with the Executive and its global connections initiative, which is targeted specifically at business and the new technologies. I have discussed the idea with opinion formers throughout Scotland, and there is a unanimity of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
view that that is necessary. Everyone agrees that the time is right to use that worldwide resource, and everyone recognises that their own sector, whether it be banking, university research, trade, the arts, business or the voluntary sector—and consequently, all of us—stands to gain if a clear message is sent throughout the world about the new Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Achieving that aim means reaching out to the extended Scottish family and encouraging our friends to take a stake in the rebirth of Scotland—a modern, confident, democratic, high-tech Scotland. I want to reach out to that diaspora and carry to the friends of Scotland around the world our vision for a prosperous, outward-looking and caring Scotland in the United Kingdom to tap that immensely rich seam of good will towards Scotland world wide, among those millions of people of Scottish origin, among the tens of thousands who have graduated from our universities and moved out internationally to become movers and shakers in their own countries, and among the millions who share our belief in innovation, hard work and compassion. That seam has been largely untouched. Devolution has created a new opportunity to realise that good will for the people of Scotland and, in partnership with the Scottish Executive, that is what I intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my visit to New York in the aftermath of 11 September, I saw the closeness of the ties that exist. The host of the dinner at which I spoke in New York joined us last night in the Banqueting house. When times have been hard in Scotland, we have faced much adversity as a people and our friends in the United States have often been there to help us. Many hon. Members will have family in the United States of America. Americans of Scottish descent have often reached out to us. In America's time of trial, we reached out to them, and they showed their appreciation in ways that touched me deeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us saw the moving day when the Coldstream Guards played the "Star-Spangled Banner" outside Buckingham palace. Mayor Giuliani invited the Coldstream Guards to New York to play during the week "UK with New York". Tens of thousands of people went to hear them, and bandsmen were overwhelmed by the warmth of feeling that they received because there was a sense that a people was reaching out to embrace them. We must recognise that we must draw closer together internationally as the world becomes a harsher place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That recognition, in part, underpins the initiative that I launched last night—the friends of Scotland initiative. Much work must be done, and today I announce the membership of the advisory group that will support me in taking the initiative forward. The members are senior figures from various fields who have connections with Scotland's friends throughout the world and will help to develop the initiative. I am embarking on not an off-the-shelf formula but a process that involves listening to people and developing ideas for the maximum benefit of Scotland. I want the initiative to involve business, commerce, tourism and the arts, government and the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Nine distinguished and imaginative Scots will serve as the initial members of the group, which I will chair. They are: Sir John Kerr, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; Professor Tom Devine, the director of the Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies at Aberdeen university; Donal Dowds, the managing director of BAA Scottish Airports and chairman elect of Scottish Council for Development and Industry; Eddie Frizzell, the head of the Scottish Executive Department for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning; Susan Rice, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB Scotland; Douglas Rae, the managing director of Ecosse Films; David Taylor, the chief executive of the Scottish Football Association; Kim Winser, the chief executive of Pringle of Scotland; and Dr. Sheila Brock who was, until recently, the campaign director of the Museum of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group will help me to tap into the networks that already exist through which Scotland is connected overseas. Some of the connections are obvious: the work that is undertaken by the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise under the global connections strategy is a good example. However, there are many more connections that are not as clearly defined, such as connections that involve cultural linkages or the arts. We must start work quickly; I would like that to start before the end of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A friends of Scotland unit will be established in the Scotland Office, which will work with the Executive and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to make the most of Scotland's enormous strengths, to pull together the story of Scotland, and to tell that to the friends of Scotland around the world. It will support the advisory group and implement its decisions. Resources that are necessary will be committed to the unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to reach out to many people around the world and equip them to give the message about the new Scotland. Many of them, like us, do not know the full story of what is happening throughout Scotland. Much of what occurs is exciting and fast moving. These people will be envoys and champions, and will probably be members of the Scottish diaspora who have made their lives elsewhere, but they may also be people who feel great kinship and friendship with Scotland. They will be invited to spread the message and help the new Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will use the internet to communicate the message and to provide news, information and advice. We will develop "Scotland: The Script", which will be a straightforward and up-to-date tool for anyone spreading the message in government or outside. We will develop a bridge of people throughout the world by fostering exchanges and secondments so that people at different levels in our society may work internationally to help to cement relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland can hold its head high in the world. It has a proud history, which has left a mark that far exceeds what we could have expected realistically. However, the time has come to stop repeating our history. It is time to tell a new story about a Scotland that is doing well and making its mark in the world. What is happening today in Scotland must be broadcast far
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
and wide. It is time to reach out to all in the world who have a soft spot for Scotland, but to turn that soft spot into hard benefits for the people of Scotland. I urge each and every member of the Committee and each and every Scottish Member of Parliament to join me in doing that. We have a great story to tell; let us go and tell it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for giving us the opportunity to debate Scotland in the wider world. She mentioned that the fax machine was invented in Scotland, no doubt to tease me. She does not know, however, quite how far that barb struck home, because the fax machine was invented by Alexander Bain in the village of Watten, bang in the middle of my constituency. That will not go down well in the 	<i>Caithness Courier.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State began by speaking of the devolution settlement, and I believe that what she said is right. The historic devolution settlement that permitted the Scottish Parliament to come into existence has had a major impact on liberating Scotland's drive and energy. Some three or four years before the Parliament came into being, I remember, when visiting various financial institutions in Edinburgh on business, finding a certain lack of drive and a feeling that Edinburgh was—dare I say it in this Committee—almost a provincial city. When I returned about a year after the Parliament had started, there was a real feeling of power in Edinburgh. People clearly felt that they were in a capital city and wanted to get things done. In the financial markets, the impact was noticeable of Holyrood's having given the city the ability to have such determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Secretary of State that, as a starting point, the devolution settlement that our two parties and much of civic Scotland worked together to bring about has been vital in driving forward the energy that has been released in Scotland. I promise her that I will not praise everything that she said, but when one is being an effective Opposition, rather than just an Opposition, it is important to congratulate the Government on points that are worthy of congratulation and recognise good ideas when one sees them, as well as bringing to the Government's attention areas where they could do better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that light, I must say that I greatly enjoyed dinner last night and thank the Secretary of State for her warm hospitality. The lamb might have come from Caithness rather than Ayrshire, but I will not be too critical on that. Broadly, the concept of the friends of Scotland, and of being aggressive in the world—going out and selling the positive aspects of Scotland—is good. I do not think that anyone could or should dissent from it. I congratulate the Secretary of State on that. Our party will do its part in that drive, even if we find ways of telling her that she should be doing things differently, and criticise some of what she does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first saw the title of the debate, I was reminded of being at primary school at Miller
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
academy in Thurso. When we wrote our addresses in our jotters, we would add, "Caithness, Scotland, Great Britain, Europe, The World, The Universe, Infinity". I saw the title as one that would allow a pretty wide debate and I was not certain where to begin, so I thought that I would begin in Spain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is actually a very good reason for beginning with Spain. Last night, the Secretary of State took great pride in saying that there were many things that people did not know about Scotland. She quoted many interesting facts. In the words of that actor, not a lot of people know this, but Spain is the greatest single market for Scotch whisky—it is worth over £308 million, I believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotch whisky is one of those great traditional industries of ours. I must immediately declare an interest, although not the usual one, in that I am not only a major consumer of Scotch whisky but a patron of the Keepers of Quaich, which is an interesting organisation, perhaps very pertinent to the debate. We usually say that it was set up in the mists of time—in fact it was set up about 12 years ago, which is the mists of time—as a marketing tool by the Scotch Whisky Association, for the promotion of Scotch whisky overseas. We have two banquets annually at Blair castle, and the organisation has worked extremely well in helping to promote the product. It is a good example of relationship marketing, which is about going out and finding the people with whom you have the most in common and then bringing your products to them. It is a good way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whisky is also important in other ways, and it illustrates the diversity and linkages that there are in Scotland. A key fact is that Scotch whisky consumes something in the order of 400,000 tonnes of barley a year, so it is a vital part of the agricultural sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the criticisms that I would like to make of the Secretary of State is that in all that I heard last night and all that she said today, there was no direct reference to agriculture. If we consider the primary sector exports for Scotland and remove oil and gas, the two primary exports are fisheries and agriculture. Those are very important categories. Coming from a fishing constituency and having been chairman of Scrabster Harbour Trust, I certainly know the importance of the fisheries side. However, I believe that agriculture is a key export for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a certain extent, that criticism typifies some of the concerns that I have in the current drive to promote a great new Scotland, which is that we do not lose sight of the great traditional Scotland. Whether in tourism or our traditional industries, we must build on what we have, not set aside what we have. I therefore ask the Secretary of State and those responsible, please do not discard shortbread and tartan and all the other things that are perhaps a little bit cliché Scotland, because there are an awful lot of people throughout the world who come to Scotland and buy it precisely because that exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a very valid point. Sometimes in the past when we have seen activities aimed at rebranding Scotland, we have thrown away the thing that is our distinctive selling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
point—our history and tradition. The hon. Gentleman is right; I did not refer to agriculture, but I did refer to Scottish food. Sometimes we need to promote Scottish agriculture in a different way. Last night we ate some of the produce from Scottish agriculture, put together by three of Scotland's greatest chefs—indeed, three of Europe's greatest chefs. Sometimes in telling the story, we need to use different angles to get our message across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely accept that, and I am glad that the right hon. Lady accepted it. However, we must not lose sight of the importance of agriculture, particularly in the more remote and rural areas of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In looking at the figures for Scotland, one is actually very deceived, because the figures for the whole of Scotland hide the fact that within Scotland there are many different economies in different areas. Although I am delighted that some parts of Scotland have done extremely well, such as the regeneration in the central belt and silicon valley, other large geographical areas of Scotland have not enjoyed the same prosperity. It would be useful if the figures on the regional split of the Scottish economy were more readily accessible. We would then begin to see that what looks good as a broad picture conceals some high spots and some depressing valleys. When we go out and sell Scotland, we must be aware that we must sell the industries in those valleys, as well as the more modern peaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady mentioned tourism and it would be impossible for me, having spent 25 years in the business, to allow a debate to go by without referring to tourism. One interesting fact is that Scottish tourism is 80 per cent, dependent on the United Kingdom and only 20 per cent. dependent on overseas visitors. If I may mention the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] There was extremely good Talisker on the table last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about flights into Scottish airports is that they are largely a domestic market and, being particularly driven by business, it has recovered extremely well. It is not a reflection of what is happening in Scottish tourism. Anyone who is dependent on the overseas market in Scotland has seen that market virtually wiped out. We face an immense job in bringing people back from overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have touched on the concept of branding. I congratulate visitscotland.com on its new strategy. It is right that we should seek to sell by looking at products. People do not come to Scotland because they want to go to places, unless they are genealogical tourists; they come for golf, walking or another activity and visitscotland.com's recognition that that is the way in which tourism should be promoted is absolutely right. Tourism is worth almost £1 billion to Scotland and is one of its largest employers, particularly in the highlands where 13 or 14 per cent, of the population are employed in that industry.

The Secretary of State spoke at length about our place in Europe. It is Scotland's most important export market and around £979 million of EU funds will

The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) referred to the relationship of Scotland working through Westminster and we must make some progress in that area. Referring again to agriculture, my good friend Ross Finnie tried extremely hard to persuade Europe to make the less-favoured-area settlement more generous and he tried very hard to improve the poor level of sheep annual premium subsidy. In both cases, he felt that the support that he received from DEFRA was way below what it might have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By common accord, Ross Finnie has been doing what Ross Finnie should be doing: his job in Scotland. I hear from the constituents that I speak to that he has been doing a very good job for Scotland.

Scottish Executive Ministers have attended the following Council of Ministers' meetings: three education, eight fisheries, three environment, five agriculture, one lifelong learning, one justice and home affairs, one health, one transport and one regional policy. Scottish Ministers have led the UK delegation to Council meetings on three occasions, two on education and one on health. Those figures are slightly dated because 13 July 2001 is the latest date for which figures are available.

On the economy, there is and always has been an historic difference between the economies of Scotland and the United Kingdom when expressed in terms of GDP. During the past few years, that gap has narrowed and improved and it is good news that our export performance was better than that of the whole of the United Kingdom. However, there is an underlying lag and we must catch up. It is a shame that almost all the available figures are for 1999 or early 2000.I suspect that if we had figures dating from late 2000 to early 2001 we would see a different picture. There have been considerable job losses and the manufacturing industry is having a torrid time throughout the United Kingdom and particularly in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the figures and the time lag. The monthly unemployment and employment figures are an important means of measuring economic performance, and have been consistently good. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
has been a dip during the past couple of months, not unexpectedly, but we still have record low levels of unemployment, which are the best for a generation, and more people in employment than at any time for 40 years. Those are important indicators and, believe me, in my constituency and that of the hon. Gentleman those are the figures that affect people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. However, I have to say that I am concerned—as, I am sure, are many hon. Members—by the fact that the figures have now turned and I am worried about where the economy is going. During the Chancellor's bravura but complacent statement yesterday, he seemed to suggest that the United Kingdom would be the only economy to survive. I do not share the Chancellor's confidence and I am concerned about that.

I return to where I started and congratulate the Secretary of State on her initiative. I enjoyed the video. What she is trying to do with the friends of Scotland initiative is important and should be welcomed as a cross-party initiative. I believe that it will deliver for Scotland. However, despite all that she is doing, I hope that she will not throw away the baby of tradition with the bathwater of the past. Will she please not forget our traditional industries, particularly agriculture, and the economic split between the powerhouse of central Scotland and some of the remoter areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Tynan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the friends of Scotland initiative that was announced last May. It is an important initiative and some meat has been put on the bones today. This debate is not only important, but timely. It may be coincidence that last night's dinner was held just before this debate, but the advent of the euro is important in the context of the debate. The events of the past month, and particularly of 11 September, have ensured that the people of every country are looking beyond their own shores and borders, and it is on that basis that we should consider Scotland's position in the world. Scotland has always been an outward-looking nation, and that habit is vital in the world today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks will be pro-European and I make no apology for that, but I do not dismiss the importance of exporting and importing goods world wide. None the less, I believe that Scotland should focus on Europe; if we do not, other European countries might leave us behind. Scotland has taken the lead in promoting Scottish business on the continent. Figures provided by sources such as the Department of Trade and Industry, Customs and Excise and—of all people—South Bank university are very impressive and worth reiterating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 70 per cent, of Scottish exports go to European Union countries. France is Scotland's top export market, with 17 per cent, of our exports. In 1999–2000, France became the first individual market to important more than £3 billion of Scottish goods. Six of Scotland's seven export markets are in the EU, and nearly 300,000 Scottish jobs depend on exports to
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the EU. Some 1,000 foreign-owned businesses serve their European and global customers from bases in Scotland. Despite the recent downturn in the communications industry, silicon glen constitutes the largest concentration of electronic companies in Europe. Those figures show how successful Scotland has been in the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By striving to be at the heart of Europe, Scottish business has shown a pragmatism that national political figures have not always shown in the past. That is why I welcome this important initiative. Working in partnership with the Scottish Executive, we can do much more for the people of Scotland. We need to state the case for Europe repeatedly, and we should tell our people openly how important Europe is. We must convince people that, when the time is right, we should move closer to Europe through the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be surprised to hear that I concur entirely with many of his remarks about Europe, and particularly on the French market. However, I should temper his suggestion that France is our greatest European ally by mentioning its on-going refusal to import Scottish beef. If he had mentioned that fact, he would have given his argument greater weight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tynan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Europe is not perfect. The Scottish Parliament and Ross Finnie in particular are working very hard to sort out the problems, and I am confident that they will succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1989, a financial package of European funding, which also includes contributions from the Scottish Enterprise network, local authorities, the voluntary sector, and colleges and universities, has invested £1 billion in the economy of western Scotland. Since 1985, Scotland has attracted inward investment of more than £11 billion, which constitutes between 15 and 20 per cent, of all UK inward investment projects. That would simply not be the case, were we not deeply engaged in Europe. Moreover, our quality work force makes Scotland a gateway to the EU and brings us vast economic benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in my constituency of Hamilton, South are benefiting from the constructive and meaningful approach to the EU. In the period 1997–99, European funds invested more than £5 million in projects in Hamilton, and projects in Lanarkshire received nearly £8 million. The new spending round, which will run from 2000 to 2006, will also benefit my constituency. For example, the workplace initiative in Hamilton was granted more than £300,000 of European funds under the 2000 to 2006 programme to refurbish the local Burnbank library. It will build a unique job access and training centre for local residents, with an information technology learning centre, training space, a vacancy display, and outreach counselling services. That is the sort of initiative by which the community will understand the benefits of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of subsidiarity has worked to Scotland's benefit. It is a strong voice on the European Union Committee of the Regions. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
to be welcomed. The Labour Government accepted when instituting devolution that decisions should be taken at the lowest level appropriate to Scottish people's needs: sometimes in Edinburgh, sometimes in Westminster and sometimes in Brussels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the hon. Gentleman's logic, is he not concerned that most subjects regarding devolved matters that are debated and decided on at European level are not attended by Scottish Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tynan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman missed my point about devolution and relations with the UK. My view is that if we work and deliver in partnership, we will be better able to deliver for the people of Scotland. If we become negative and introverted, we devalue and deprive Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Lazarowicz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is good that attendance and participation by Ministers of the Scottish Executive in the European Council is much better than representation and attendance by members of the Scottish National party in this Chamber? There is hardly any attendance by Scottish Ministers in the decision-making procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tynan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more concerned to promote the positives than the negatives. There is much that we can promote that is very positive and, if we do so, we do not fall into the same trap as Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the weight and influence that Scotland has as a strong and vital part of Britain, we can shape Europe. If Scotland were independent, not part of the UK, and not working in partnership, we would lose influence in Europe. We would be regarded as a small nation trying to play at the big table. It is vital to be part of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government have not gone far enough in committing to the European project of establishing peace, security and economic prosperity. When the economic conditions are right, Scotland must take its rightful place in the eurozone. Otherwise, we could lose out badly. The large amount of inward investment that Scotland has seen during the last decade will be in danger if we remain outside the euro. We have already witnessed a worrying trend in the first few years of the euro's life. Foreign investment in the UK manufacturing sector fell by 15 per cent, in 2000, but in countries that have joined the euro it rose by 38 per cent. That demonstrates what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strength of the pound and the volatility of the currency markets mean that while Scotland stays out of the euro it is less attractive to inward investment. The quality of the Scottish work force may not be enough to negate the risks inherent in dealing in a different currency from the rest of the EU. Scotland has become a gateway to Europe for many American and Japanese companies during the past few decades. If we are not careful, that investment might drain away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Producing goods under one currency and selling them in another is a risky strategy, especially when there is an option with far less risk. Sudden changes in exchange rates can wipe out profits and knock a company completely off course. Continental countries
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
are embracing economic reform with enthusiasm. They are deregulating labour markets, cutting taxes and attempting to generate a more entrepreneurial business culture, thereby further eroding Britain's competitive advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changing currency is an expensive business in this country. Britain spends about £4.5 billion on changing between currencies. I am deeply concerned about how long we can afford to put ourselves at that disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic downturn of recent months has highlighted how fragile global trade can be. Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said that Britain is well placed to weather the storm—and that is thanks to the Chancellor's prudent economic policies since 1997—we cannot become complacent because too many people's lives depend on economic success. In 1999–2000, there was a loss of some 12,000 manufacturing jobs in the Scottish manufacturing sector. Although that was not due merely to our absence from the eurozone, it does not help that we are outwith it. Numerous companies, including Daks Simpson in Lanarkshire and OKI Electronics in Cumbernauld, have blamed the strong pound and, although that should not be used as an excuse, I recognise that they are facing barriers that competitors on mainland Europe are not and that that is not helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that a debate on the single currency in Scotland could create divisions among and within political parties, but it must happen as soon as possible. We must engage with people in Scotland and the UK and ensure that we promote the case for the euro. If we do, real progress will be made. When the euro becomes a reality next year, and the coins and notes are in the pockets of those going on holiday, there will be pressure to consider the euro in toto. On the basis of our current convergence, in respect of growth rates, the two economies are moving to a similar situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we can persuade the Scottish people of the single currency's benefits. Opinion polls show that they are more pro-European than other Britons; they are aware of Scotland's wider role in the world and so are well placed to give a lead to other parts of the country and present the substantial facts on Europe. Despite the malicious scare stories that are propagated in many sections of the press, the British population are not as Europhobic as is sometimes assumed. The Conservative Opposition would be wise to take heed of that. The health of Scottish trade and industry depends upon it, and that is an argument that we cannot move away from. We must ensure that we deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the devolution settlement for the Scottish Parliament, we promoted a consensual Parliament—one that was different from Westminster. We have seen that working under the Liberal and Labour parties, but we have not seen other Opposition parties working with the people of Scotland, or with the nation. The Scottish Parliament must be used as a method of joining elements together to deliver for the people. If it is not, the parties that are currently

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin in much the same way as the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, by saying that it is important to approach any Government announcement or proposal on its merits. On behalf of the Scottish National party, I welcome any measure that may boost Scotland's standing in the world and I wish the Secretary of State every success in doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Secretary of State, I think that we need to understand the wider issues in the international community and the global economy, and how they might impact on Scotland so that we can find the right answers, which will position Scotland for the future. The challenge for legislators here and in the Scottish Parliament is how to deal with this—the Secretary of State described it as a new perspective—in a way that guarantees success and ensures that it is accountable and democratically answerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of the biggest challenges that we face are globalisation and, of course, terrorism. All parties, including the SNP, believe that enhanced international co-operation is essential, whether it be through the European Union, as the hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) suggested, the United Nations or informal coalitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the Secretary of State overlooked the biggest single development in Europe: the enlargement of the European Union. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that when he winds up. Enlargement should be seen not as a problem but as an opportunity, and I urge the Government to take that on board as part of this initiative. Incidentally, the majority of the countries that we would all welcome into the full European Union are small and medium-sized independent countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I have visited several enlargement countries as part of the Government's involvement with the accession process. One of the remarkable features that I found, especially in Prague, was the large number of Scottish businesses that operate in countries such as the Czech Republic. I should tell my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke) that I was amazed to discover that the man who runs the biggest property company in Prague comes from Coatbridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State. She is right to draw attention to the great potential of countries throughout central and eastern Europe, where there is already a Scottish interest. One need only look at Estonia and the number of Scots who live in Tallinn to appreciate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments of the Secretary of State and urge other members of the Committee to speak to their friends and relations abroad to encourage them to help, in relation to this proposal or in any other way, to boost Scotland's standing in the world. I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
that my friends will take part in the scheme, and look forward to getting their impressions of how it is progressing. I welcome it in the sense that I welcome anything that will add value to our single commercial embassy, Scotland house in Brussels, or help the limited number of hard-working Scottish representatives from Scottish Development International and VisitScotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Secretary of State some questions about the proposal that the Minister may be able to answer in his reply to the debate. On 7 October 2001, an article was published in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday,</i> headlined "In search of envoys to sell Scotland", about a scheme billed as an initiative by the Scottish Executive's Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, Wendy Alexander. It gives a detail that the Secretary of State did not mention, namely that the organisation concerned hopes in the first year to have 300 ambassadors harnessing support for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State did not make it clear whether her project is a rival to that initiated by Wendy Alexander. This morning, there was no mention of it on the website of Scottish Development International, the organisation that will supposedly be scouring the globe for ambassadors, nor on the websites of the Scotland Office, which I visited last night and this morning, or the Scottish Executive. I am not sure how that works in terms of joined-up government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad about that, because I only announced it half an hour ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State still has not answered my question. Is the project being run by the Scotland Office or the Scottish Executive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is new to the House, but he will learn in time not to believe everything that he reads in the papers. We could not have put much of this initiative together had it not been for the help of the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and the active participation of her officials. The hon. Gentleman must have been talking to one of his colleagues when I announced that a member of my advisory committee is Eddie Frizzell, head of the Department of Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. He should really try to pay more attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the third time, we still do not know whether the Scotland Office or the Scottish Executive is running this project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Moving on to the issue of potential candidates for ambassadors for Scotland, I shall suggest some people who may have time on their hands and be able to help and contribute. Perhaps Susan—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] We should not overlook Tom McCabe, a man whose diplomatic skills will be in hot demand.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Carmichael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it—again the Secretary of State has not clarified this point—the posts are voluntary. They are unpaid posts that are not full time. I am happy to suggest to anybody who may have some—even a little—spare time, that they could help to boost Scotland's role around the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several other questions that I urge the Secretary of State to consider. Who is funding the project and what will its budget be? How much money will be invested? She mentioned in her introductory remarks and in the press release that there is to be a special unit at the Scotland Office working on the project. How many people will be working in that unit? What funding, training and materials will the volunteer ambassadors receive? Will they report to the Scotland Office or to the Scottish Executive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Secretary of State and the Government believe that this initiative will rival our competitors' efforts? Although I welcome anything that will boost Scotland's standing, it must be seen in the context of the efforts of our competitors from Europe and around the world. The new First Minister, Jack McConnell, has often said that Flanders is one of our major competitors—I note that the Secretary of State is nodding, so that is clearly the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the case—interesting. The First Minister believes that it is a good model. Flanders has more than 98 career commercial ambassadors. The Secretary of State mentioned that eastern Europe is important. Interestingly, Flanders has signed co-operation treaties with almost every country in central and eastern Europe. Flanders was part of the Belgian delegation to the World Trade Organisation in Doha. Nobody from either the Scotland Office or the Scottish Executive attended. Compared with Scotland's current assets, which consist of one commercial embassy in Brussels where the staff work commendably hard—[	<i>Interruption</i>.].
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that members of the Committee mention UK embassies, and I shall turn to that. This morning, I thought that it would be interesting as we come towards St. Andrew's day to ask some of the UK's embassies what they are doing to promote Scotland in this key week. What are they doing to help Scottish exports, inward investment and tourism? My office managed to get through to 15 British embassies this morning. Out of the 15, only one is holding an event to mark St. Andrew's day and to promote Scottish exports, inward investment and trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must look at the reality of the matter and compare Scotland's efforts with those of our competitors. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that what happens in terms of Scotland's promotion is the same as what happens in Ireland for St. Patrick's day? I do not think so. I would like to quote some of the British embassies' interesting responses to my question. A diplomat asked, "When is St. Andrew's day?" and said, "Never heard of a special event." The Paris embassy said, "Scotland is devolved now." Rome said, "There is a St. Andrew's church just round the corner." Oslo said, "We have never done anything like this, ever." Budapest said, "Somebody has been asking about representation," and Warsaw has been able to confirm that there is a public holiday in Poland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Anniesland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not listening to my two key points. First, I welcome the Secretary of State's initiative, and secondly, our current embassy and commercial set-up is not representing Scotland effectively. If he thinks that just one embassy out of 50 doing something, in the week of our national day, to promote exports, inward investment and tourism for Scotland is good enough, he should be thinking—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] I have already given way on more than enough occasions and I would like to make progress.

On the issue of representation at an international level, there has been some interest in how many meetings have been attended. It has been overlooked that, under the treaty of Nice, the various nations on this island would have more representation at a European level if we were represented directly. The argument about having less of a voice holds no water whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to turn to the issue of attendance at Council of Ministers meetings, which has caused problems for the Secretary of State. She has been unable to tell the Committee how many meetings took place in total. She has told us which specific meetings were attended, but not the percentage. Perhaps I can enlighten her. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] Oh, it is not important how many meetings are attended?

The hon. Member for Hamilton, South will be aware that some of the key decisions are not taken at Council of Ministers meetings but at working groups. That is where the key issues are hashed out between officials. The UK Government have never answered the key question of how many working group meetings are attended by Scottish Executive officials, but the number was confirmed by the head of the Scottish Executive office in Brussels. Between 1997 and 1999, 75 meetings were attended, which sounds like a lot. However, that is 75 out of 4,500, which is an attendance of 1.7 per cent., with 98 per cent, bunking off. Our representation is pathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems clear that the hon. Gentleman believes that only someone from the Scottish Executive can speak on behalf of Scotland. If there are representatives from the United Kingdom Government, there is a chance that they will be Scottish as, after all, there are more Scots in the British Labour Cabinet than there are members of the SNP in this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key point that I am making is that devolution surely means that decisions about devolved matters are taken in Scotland and that devolved matters discussed at a European level should be dealt with by devolved Scottish Ministers. The attendance is appalling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tynan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, there are 17 regions in Spain that have more autonomy than the Scottish Parliament. Central Government in Spain have recognised the fact that there is devolved and central government, and Ministers of central Government attend meetings, not the people from the regions. Would the hon. Gentleman consider that in the context of Scotland, where a partnership is taking place between Scotland and the United Kingdom? He should worry not about meetings but about what it is being done for the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that, because his point is sensible. However, I am sorry that he chose to overlook Germany, Austria and Belgium, which are all countries with a level of direct representation far in excess of Scotland's, whether in terms of their integration in the federal structure or of direct representation at a European level. Perhaps he will also agree that he chose to overlook the fact that the commission set up on Spain will include a Basque, a Catalan and a Galician to consider the future of Europe. The Secretary of State could not confirm whether anyone from Scotland would be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State asked us to have a new perspective on Scotland in the world. We agree that that is important, but a large part of the perspective ignores the global economic realities and, sadly, the opportunities. The SNP welcomes and will encourage volunteers to help boost Scotland, but that cannot and should not replace the need for dedicated professional staff like those of our competitors. The perspective of the Secretary of State and the Labour party is to control devolved functions and talk down Scotland's ability to take an effective and direct role in international economic, political and diplomatic developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State prefers that Scottish Executive Ministers should hear nothing, see nothing and say nothing in the key decision-making organisations in European and the world. That is no new perspective: it is the same old Labour tune, which ignores the reality of the world and fails to trust our abilities to improve on the second-rate deal that Scotland currently gets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Lazarowicz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the announcement by the Secretary of State about friends of Scotland. I am glad that the initiative has support from across the House. However, the grudging tone—to put it mildly—of the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) suggests the old adage, "With friends like that, who needs enemies?" I hope that if any members of the Scottish National party are sent on any overseas missions on behalf of friends of Scotland, they give a pledge that they will talk Scotland up and not down, as he has done today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative is welcome. Many other countries with a substantial diaspora make use of the contacts that that gives them throughout the world, and Ireland has been mentioned in that context. I do not have any Scottish ancestors, but I have been contacted by official bodies from Poland and community representatives in this country, who recognise the value of using the contacts that they can make with Members such as myself. I am sure that hundreds if not thousands of parliamentarians of Scottish descent in countries around the world can play a role by being friends of Scotland abroad. The initiative does not need to be restricted to people of Scottish ancestry. My

constituency has a substantial Pakistani and Bangladeshi community, and many successful business men and women there see themselves as friends of Scotland and want to use every opportunity to promote Scotland in the countries from which their ancestors came.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Secretary of State highlighted some of the success stories of the Scottish economy. It is important to talk up those successes, and to give the right message to the outside world. One of those successes is the financial sector. That is of particular interest to me, as my constituency contains the international headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, the headquarters of several other Scottish financial institutions and major employers such as Standard Life, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Lloyd's TSB Scotland, to name but a few. However, it is not only a constituency interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and a few other hon. Members were fortunate this morning to attend a briefing by representatives of Scottish Financial Enterprise. They emphasised the importance of the financial sector not only to Edinburgh and Glasgow but to the entire Scottish economy. That sector employs 90,000 people directly and another 90,000 in support services. It has grown by almost 10 per cent, in the past year, which is another success story. That success can not only benefit the financial sector itself but, because of its international connections, it can be used to promote Scotland actively and positively to the outside world. That discussion highlighted also the importance of Scottish links to the wider world and of having the right policies to build on those links and ensure better relations with the outside world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues mentioned this morning are of particular importance to the financial sector. The first is Europe. It was made clear this morning that the financial institutions' decision whether to join the euro is political rather than financial. They are well prepared for entry into the eurozone. We heard that one of the main institutions has spend about £65 million preparing for the introduction of the euro because much of its business is done within the zone. The extra costs of British membership would be relatively small. However, too long a period of uncertainty on membership of the euro would certainly be damaging for the financial sector. That is why I associate myself with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South, who supports membership of the euro and wants a decision to be taken at the earliest possible date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point raised this morning was the need of the financial sector, in Scotland and the UK generally, for a level playing field when dealing with the rest of Europe. Concern was expressed about the fact that some sectors of the financial services industry elsewhere in Europe are excessively regulated in order to protect the domestic market. That problem needs to be addressed. We in Scotland benefit from being a major player in the European market, because it gives us the opportunity to make our case in Europe. If we had only the smaller participatory role that the SNP wants, we would no longer have that benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
The conclusion I draw from considering the financial services sector, as with so many other sectors of our economy and industry that depend on strong international links, is how important it is for Scotland that we now have stability in our country's constitutional settlement. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] SNP Members may make the case for independence and separation if they so wish—it is a respectable view to hold—but I sometimes wish that they would propose it with a little more honesty than comes through in their campaigns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no problem with the hon. Gentleman having views, but he should not project them on to business or financial institutions that lobby him as their Member of Parliament. One does not do that sort of thing. If he knew the private political views of two of the most senior financial people in Scotland, he would not make that point. He should make his own points if he is against independence, and should not make them as though they came from other people—that is not on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lazarowicz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have been too busy sneering to hear my clear statement that the views that I expressed were my own. I did not claim to speak on behalf of the financial sector as a whole or of individuals within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Pete Wishart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has seen the recent opinion polls that showed that the vast majority of Scottish people wanted increased powers for the Scottish Parliament. How does that square with his view that the constitutional argument is dead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lazarowicz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the most recent polls showed a fall in support for the SNP and independence. I have no doubt that the prospects of the Scottish financial sector would be done the most damage possible if a new risk were perceived of a period of uncertainty in the Scottish constitutional settlement and the relationship between Scotland and the UK. The biggest risk to thousands of jobs in my constituency, as in constituencies throughout Scotland, would be if the threat of separatism were to become real. It would mean more than just separation from the UK, as it would bring us a high-tax and high-regulation economy of the type that SNP Members want imposed on Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is somewhat superfluous of me to ask the Secretary of State to oppose such policies. I am sure that she will do so, as she has always done in the past. However, it is important that we all reflect on the fact that it is incumbent on us to make devolution work and the constitutional settlement a success, and not to try to take the first opportunity to unravel and undermine it in the way that the members of the SNP seem determined to do at every opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join those who have placed on the record how much they enjoyed the hospitality last night, the quality of the Scottish food on the menu and, in part, the message that was put before them of the need to promote Scotland, create

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
the friends of Scotland and take that wider message throughout the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs will consider the workings of the friends of Scotland in more detail, as well as its efficiency and how it will evolve. I recognised names on the lists of advisory groups, and I recognise the quality that those people have to contribute. I welcome their commitment. In reply, the Minister might tell us how they were chosen, how they are accountable, and what their relationship is to him and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The video contained many strong messages. It is difficult for a Grand Committee to rewrite a script, but "Scotland: The Script" and the video might need to be tweaked. For instance, there were occasionally pictures of oil platforms somewhere out to sea, but oil platforms do not necessarily signify Scotland and a major Scottish industry, as they could be anywhere in the world. We should remind ourselves as well as the rest of the world of the importance of the oil and gas industry to the UK economy, especially the Scottish economy. It can still make a major contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the frightening aspects of the current energy inquiry is the premature presumption that North sea oil is coming to an end, but we still have reserves that more than equal what has already been found. In promoting Scotland abroad, it is extremely important that we recognise the need to invest in Scotland. As one major source of inward investment, we need to attract the world's financial institutions to invest in North sea oil. We welcome the pilot initiatives and the taskforce. We also welcome the discussions that are taking place among those in the industry, between industry and the Government and between Government Departments. Much constructive work is being done but we must not lose sight of the fact that the industry has a long-term future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a long-term future, too, for our export industry. The skills that have been developed in the North sea, as it becomes a mature province, will be of great value in other world markets. If we can keep North sea oil going, it will provide a major export base from which to develop the industry. I am worried by a frightening complacency among those working in economic development—this is often used against me by Labour Members on the Grand Committee. Constituencies such as those in Aberdeen and Banff and Buchan have been attacked for having low unemployment and it has been argued that we should not discuss the economy. There is a danger that those involved in economic activity see low unemployment in certain areas and think that there is no need to worry about them. Obviously, the infrastructure, support and challenges are different in those areas and, for those who live in such places, it is great to have that extra buoyancy in the economy. However, there are also challenges because skill shortages put a cap on attracting further investment, and infrastructure shortages and transport problems can constrain economic growth. I urge all those who are involved in examining the Scottish economy not to lose sight of the need to think ahead and work out how
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
to keep what is good, learn lessons from it and build on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the skills shortage, we must maintain an open attitude to people from abroad who come to work in Scotland. People who have spent their entire life based in the north-east of Scotland, working in the North sea, have not needed a work permit to work offshore. Their whole lives are orientated towards Scotland but as soon as they stop working on that platform, they must leave the country because they have accrued no right of indefinite leave to remain. We need to reconsider how we treat people who have contributed so much to our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to discuss a few issues specifically relevant to the north-east of Scotland. The rail capital of Europe is linked by a railway line with single track on part of the line south. If we cannot join the north of Scotland to the rest of Europe through the channel tunnel with effective, high-quality, modern rail links, we are not exploiting effectively the fact that we are in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to link up with the world, we must also recognise the need to extend our IT networks into the rural economy. One of my constituents is at the forefront of printing technology. His clients in Hawaii send him a CD-ROM by post, but imagine how much more competitive he could be if he had broadband access to the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross about agriculture. The Minister was right to say that food is an important form of recognition. If we can add value to our economy by promoting the export of our food abroad, that will be of great benefit. However, in rural communities, the worry is that Scotland's voice in Europe is blunted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the election, we had a sense that the Government cared about agriculture. Collective Cabinet responsibility means that we cannot get into Ministers' personalities, but the last Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provided some reassurance that he knew what he was trying to do, even if he did not always deliver. Since June, the hatches have been battened down and the Government have turned their back on agriculture. The message is that they do not want to hear. At meetings of the Meat and Livestock Commission, those who work in the industry are given the message, "We are not doing any more for you. You have had it." The reorganisation into a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs—DEFRA—is rapidly being interpreted in many rural communities as DEATHRA. The real worry is that, at UK level, the Government are turning their back on agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify matters in the European context. The previous Government allowed the rest of the European Union to set up the single currency. The agrimonetary compensation schemes are running out. There will be a lot of hard work to be done by anyone who is negotiating with our European colleagues about protecting our farmers from currency fluctuations affecting their support payments and their export market in Europe; when we are one of the few countries outside the eurozone it will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
difficult to persuade our colleagues inside it that they need to come up with a successor scheme to agrimonetary compensation. We need to hear more from the Government about their willingness to deal with that and to battle hard for our hard-pressed agricultural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The world is entering very uncertain waters. I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross about the Chancellor's complacency. Certainly at this time Scotland needs to work with all the friends that it can get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting if, at times, predictable debate. I shall devote the 10 minutes available to me to dealing with the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, who is named after part of his constituency—he probably owns part of his constituency—on a very balanced speech. I agree with him; the Scottish Parliament has driven life in Scotland forward and released new energy, not just in Edinburgh but throughout. As he said, two parties and the whole of civic Scotland contributed to setting up that Parliament, while two other parties sat skulking and sulking, whingeing on the sidelines. It is our parties that built the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have dealt with exports, including the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. He mentioned whisky, and its importance—I tread warily here. I am particularly concerned, as is the Secretary of State, about the current state of affairs, in which freight trains are not being allowed through the channel tunnel. That is threatening whisky exports at a crucial time—the run up to Christmas, which is celebrated throughout Europe. The Secretary of State, the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister are taking up the matter with the French authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members spoke about agriculture. Although I recognise, representing a rural constituency, that that is important, we need to put it in perspective. Of our total exports, the primary sector is only £5.5 billion out of £27.8 billion, and in the primary sector oil and gas are number one, as the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) said, followed by fisheries and then agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On oil and gas, I assure the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that we are not ignoring the great potential of the marginal fields and new exploration. Indeed, we set up pilots to study that. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in her previous job, set up and chaired that project. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned IT. If he reads the report of my remarks in Westminster Hall earlier today—it seems like yesterday—he will discover many interesting facts about IT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz), on
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
the matter of exports, that the service sector is increasingly important—particularly, of course, the financial sector. Scotland is one of the leading financial sectors in Europe. It is in the top 10 for banking, life and pensions business and for investment management. That is something to be proud of. When my hon. Friend was talking about the financial sector and its importance, the SNP Members were sniggering and sneering. They sneer all the time, instead of trumpeting the great news about what Edinburgh and the financial sector represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has had far too many interventions already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vast number of contributors to the debate welcomed the general thrust of the friends of Scotland initiative. We chose experts in the field to sit on the committee, but if the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine has any other suggestions we shall consider them. I welcome the widespread support that has been given, apart, of course, from the rather half-hearted support of the hon. Member for Moray which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith said, was something of a backhanded compliment. If that was a welcome, I wonder what an attack by him would be like. We are dealing with the matter in partnership, as the Secretary of State said, but the hon. Member for Moray does not understand the concept of partnership. The initiative was launched yesterday and we shall second people from various Departments to work with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He listed the various Council meetings that Scottish Executive Ministers have attended. They attended six in 1999, eight in 2000 and nine between January and July 2001. I am not complacent about that. I give the Committee the assurance that we are looking at appropriate ways for more Ministers to attend more meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Adams. The Minister is summing up.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the hon. Member for Moray another few instances. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) is a Scottish Member. He attends Finance Council meetings. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) attends Council meetings, as does the Minister for E-Commerce and Competitiveness, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander). They are all Scottish Ministers. Opposition Members seem to think that it is only the Scottish Executive that represents Scotland. We, too, represent Scotland. We represent Scotland in reserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two quick points. Does the Minister think that a 12 per cent, attendance rate on devolved matters is a good record? He said that the Westminster Parliament should take responsibility; should it take responsibility also for devolved matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have two attendance monitors now—one for the men, and one for the women.

Members are still sniping away from a sedentary position. We shall have many other opportunities to debate the matter. We shall hold more meetings of the Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan earlier raised the question of growth and the economy. The events of 11 September are causing concern around the world; it affects all economies, including ours. The Chancellor is not being complacent; he is being realistic. Of course it affects us, but less so than some other countries, because of our employment situation and because we have a sound economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman says about the undoubted problems that we face—problems that we are tackling—would be nothing compared with the instability and disruption that would result if the SNP was allowed to break up Britain. The SNP wants to erect borders and barriers, not to build bridges with Europe and the rest of the world. Separatism would damage Scotland in the eyes of the world. It would send out the signal that Scotland was inward looking, constantly harking back to the past rather than looking forward to its new vision of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Separatism would not enhance Scotland's voice in Europe and the world; it would reduce it. Within the United Kingdom's family of nations, Scotland is a member of G8, NATO, the Commonwealth and the European Union. That is one of the strengths of the United Kingdom. Separatism would mean the setting up of a Scottish foreign affairs department, a Scottish immigration service, a Scottish embassy network, a Scottish army and a Scottish navy. Those are not Scotland's priorities. Scotland's priorities are health, housing, education and transport. That is why the separatists and the narrow nationalists were so resoundingly defeated in June's general election, and opinion polls show that they are going even further down. I welcome the hon.

I thank the Minister of State, Scotland Office for his excellent support so far, which has been stalwart as usual. It is a very trying time for my constituents. There are many excellent Ministers with an interest in this matter, especially in the DTI, as well as at the energy department and other interested Ministries. My hon. Friend cares about the people of Scotland on a personal level, and he tries to help them individually with his political efforts. He reminds me of the poem "If", which refers to being able to walk with kings and not lose the common touch, and that very much describes my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I met the new director of the BP Grangemouth complex, Colin MacLean, and Harry McMillan the director for corporate communications for BP Scotland, the day before the announcement was made public. The Minister gave them a good grilling on all aspects of their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have written seeking a meeting with Mike Buzzacot, the chief executive of petrochemicals for Europe, who took over from Brian Sanderson. If I need to, I will go to Lord John Brown's door, the new people's peer, who is the chief executive of BP, if I do not get the answers that are needed to explain how 40 per cent, of a work force can be taken away in such a highly complex and dangerous establishment, without causing either great problems for the work force, or a great threat to that complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid running out of time, I would like to put a set of questions to the Minister, and try to weave my comments around them. I must say that we have some very serious concerns about the purpose for BP's demand for 1,000 redundancies. I believe that these redundancies are not justified by the facts as we know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
them at this time. If BP presses ahead, it will produce serious health and safety concerns for the BP complex and the surrounding community, which I represent and in which I live. I live about one mile back above the BP complex, and I can see every part of the complex, sometimes to the embarrassment and upset of the managers. I can spot when things are going wrong from my window, and often a timely phone call gets them scurrying to correct it. To go ahead without rigorous safety supervision would be a disaster. I will be looking for specific assistance from the Government and the Health and Safety Executive to ensure that risks are not taken at Grangemouth during this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that the method for appraising the work force will lead to people who have given loyal service and who have fulfilled every request that BP Grangemouth have made of them, being thrown on the scrap heap. The complex director said to the forum in Grangemouth this week that it will not just be the grey hairs who will be going. He said "there will people who want to stay that we want to go, and there will be people who want to go, but we want to stay." Basically, he is saying that MacLean will rule the day, and he will decide who stays and who goes. I think that that is worrying all 2,500 members of the BP Grangemouth work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that representatives of the work force, the trade unions, at the Scottish and national level must be satisfied with the process at every stage. It is clear that BP can achieve the proposed redundancies only by increasing overtime, by working what I believe would be unacceptable levels of overtime. I am told that there is enough overtime at BP Grangemouth to keep another 100 people in full-time employment. That is before the proposed cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Grangemouth proposals could damage the health of the work force left behind and cause great misery to the people working under those conditions and those put out of work. I believe that this is an experiment in downsizing the work force, which could be carried through not just in BP's complexes throughout the UK but in other petrochemicals complexes as well, if they can get away with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I will not take an intervention because I have many things to say on behalf of my constituents, and this is the first opportunity that I have been given to air them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Levels of overtime in the United States are so bad that people almost live on the plant. I do not think that that is where we in Europe want to go. I therefore hope that we will look at all aspects of the matter. I should like to ask the Scotland Office to ensure that all relevant Government Departments and agencies are deeply involved in the process at BP Grangemouth and in dealing with the future of the BP work force in the local community and in the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government accept that the announcement of up to 1,000 redundancies is viewed as a threat to the basic structure of the Scottish petrochemical industry? I am told by a former Minister that when a previous
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Government agreed two new licences for BP to take fuels from the north of England into the Forties pipeline, BP agreed to bring the benefit through that pipeline to Grangemouth to enhance the downstream development of chemical production there. That has happened. There has been £2 billion-worth of investment. There are new ethylene crackers, and new polypropylene, polyethylene and ethanol production units. I am worried about suggestions that the integrated synergy between Scottish and English North sea assets and the pipeline in Grangemouth may be broken in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister know of an agreement drawn up by the previous Government before 1997 that BP would use increases in feedstock into its Forties pipeline to expand and guarantee a future for Grangemouth? Will the Minister reconfirm that commitment? Will he seek a written guarantee that North sea oil and gas from BP's fields and pipelines in Scottish waters will be processed at BP's Grangemouth facilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BP's declared purpose for its actions is profitability. Let us consider that. In 1999, BP declared a £9.9 billion gross profit, or £27 million per day. In 2000, its profits almost doubled to £17.3 billion, or £47 million per day. But that is not good enough for BP. It says that in the Grangemouth complex, it lost £30 million last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that when North sea oil was SI 1 per barrel, BP told the people onshore at Grangemouth that they had to meet the $1 l-dollar challenge offshore because it was getting so little for its feedstock. Grangemouth met that by losing 600 jobs. Suddenly, when offshore oil is $27 per barrel, and BP is declaring £60 million profit offshore, onshore and offshore are split again. Grangemouth has to be treated separately, and is seen as having lost £30 million. Partly, it lost that amount because it was charged $27 per barrel for North sea oil, which pushed the on-costs through the roof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BP must make up its mind. Does it have an integrated complex from wellhead to chemical output, or separate units? It talks as if it is one complex, one Scottish asset. Will the Minister ensure that BP agrees a consistent method of assessing the performance and profitability of its Scottish assets? Will he also call upon it to end the practice of combining or splitting the offshore and onshore assets in order to transfer its costs and profits between exploration of the North sea oil and gas fields and the onshore assets? It is important to try to pin BP down, so that we have a consistent way of assessing the performance of its Scottish work force and Scottish assets. In my view, it will be shown that BP does very well out of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BP also mentions a reliability problem. In the past two years, the Grangemouth complex has had the lowest reliability of all those listed in the BP asset book. One reason for that is not work force effort but problems with management and implementation. I have examined those problems, and if BP does not study its history it is doomed to repeat it. In 1999, BP downsized the work force by 600, and related job losses are on-going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
On 29 July 1999, there was a complete power failure at BP Grangemouth. On 20 November 1999, problems with the catalytic cracker resulted in a blow-out. On 27 November 1999, a problem with the gas compressor left it out of action for 10 days.
On 26 January 2000, two boilers broke down and the major incident control committee was put on alert. In other words, the town was considered in danger. On 29 May 2000, there was a complete power failure and the major incident control committee was again put on alert. On 7 June 2000, a high-pressure pipe fracture almost resulted in an out-of-site fatality. The fracture led to a massive escape of steam beside a main road, along which a woman had been walking her dog some 10 minutes earlier. On 10 June 2000, there was a fire in the refinery unit. The catalytic cracker was burned to rust and will cost about $20 million to rebuild. As I have said, BP must study that history or it will suffer the consequences of repeating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some other questions for the Minister. Will he work with me to ensure that BP co-operates with the Health and Safety Executive, the elected representatives of Grangemouth, work force representatives and the local community to ensure that the lessons of previous BP failures are not forgotten in an attempt to reduce the work force by 40 per cent? Will he help me to ensure that any methodology or process to reduce staffing, supervision or maintenance numbers at BP Grangemouth is adopted only after full disclosure and rigorous analysis by the Health and Safety Executive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister support the principle that proposals on staffing levels at the production facilities in Grangemouth should be fully disclosed to work force representatives and to me before implementation? In particular, will he ensure that any proposed increase in overtime working is limited to European directive levels and does not endanger the health of the work force or the safety of the BP Grangemouth complex? Does he agree that the precautionary principle should apply on health and safety grounds, and that it would be better to implement any reduction in production facility staff at Grangemouth in discrete stages, in order to establish the effects of each change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any changes to the complex must be rigorous and risk free, and must not threaten the health and working ability of the work force. After the last round of cuts, workers told me, "We work until we're stressed and go off sick. Someone takes over our shifts, they go off sick, and we have to come back and work their shifts." Today, the union told me that the director intends to get rid of all non-core workers. Others at the plant will therefore have to work overtime to cover holidays, sickness and other jobs that non-core workers currently do. That is an extremely dangerous thing to do at Grangemouth, and it is not in line with the European working standards that we want. We do not want people to live to work; we want them to work to live, even in a complex that runs 24 hours a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
We should consider the consequences for the people who will lose their jobs. Neither I, the unions nor the people of Grangemouth want the work force to work in such a way as to increase costs and render BP Grangemouth uncompetitive. However, the plant can work more efficiently. For example, last year one part of the complex was supposed to run at 60 per cent, capacity, but it reached only 14 per cent. The KGXX cracker expansion has never been properly commissioned, so the complex is not working as well as it could. None the less, with present staffing levels, BP Grangemouth could have made £100 million profit last year, instead of losing £30 million, even with oil costing $27 per barrel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we work together with the Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley, local councils and the local community to ensure that when people have to leave their job they do not feel like they are being thrown on the scrap heap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give assurances to the 2,500 members of the work force at BP Grangemouth and their families, who live in my constituency and elsewhere in the central belt of Scotland and who feel that their future is threatened by BP's proposals, that he will work with me, the Scottish Executive and the local MSP Cathy Peattie to ensure that every effort is made to give people who are made redundant the widest opportunity to find gainful employment? Will he ensure that the full resources of government at UK and Scottish levels are channelled through the local department of employment, which has dealt excellently with downsizing in other industries, to make available the widest possible training, re-skilling and enterprise options? We must ensure that every opportunity is given to people threatened by this tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, will the Minister make every effort to ensure that BP, which has made it clear that it is carrying out these redundancies in the name of profit, contributes to the training and alternative employment options that are sought by the work force and the enterprise company? I am not referring just to redundancy money: BP can buy people off in its Grangemouth complex with the amount of money that it can offer individuals. There must be more than that, or we shall end up with another generation walking the streets with skills that they are not using, which happened in the 1980s and some parts of the 1990s. BP should contribute to the options available to the local community, or people will feel this blow this year, next year and every year thereafter as their earning and spending power diminishes. BP should provide assets for the local community so that this employment loss can be absorbed, and people can have confidence that there is indeed a future for BP at Grangemouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) on securing this debate on BP Grangemouth. I know from my many discussions with him that it is a topic about which he is deeply concerned, and I assure him and the Committee that the Government also take the matter seriously. I thank him for his kind remarks, and also for giving me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
notice of the specific questions that he planned to raise. I shall try to answer all his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, the trigger for this debate was the sad announcement of redundancies at BP Grangemouth. My colleagues and I regret that the Government have had to make this announcement, and that up to 1,000 job losses are planned. I understand from BP that it believes that the restructuring is necessary to allow the site to compete effectively in the future and for it to cope with the worldwide downturn in the chemical industry. I know from my hon. Friend's remarks that he understands that competition is getting keener in this area, and that that must be taken in account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, he and I recently met representatives of BP to look at all possible ways of avoiding redundancies. Both he and I urged it to consider this, and I repeat that call today. BP told us that it had taken account of safety concerns, but it also mentioned the need to optimise resources at Grangemouth within a safe operating environment and a sound cost structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been assured that BP remains committed to a secure future for the site at Grangemouth. Part of the discussions included assurances that operations would continue at the present level, albeit with a lower level of staffing. That is of course part of improving competitiveness, and I shall to come to the important question of safety in a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's immediate concern, and that of all of us, is for the work force and the families living under the threat of redundancy. I shall touch on that issue, but first I shall underscore that BP has assured us that it remains committed to a strong future for the Grangemouth site, in which it has invested $1.8 billion over the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also upstream investment to take into account. With the company's continued handling of crude oil and gas, the billion-dollar planned investment in North sea activity underpins the role of Grangemouth. The 10-year programme of investment is now bearing fruit and new plants are coming on stream. That is in addition to the company's increase in sustaining investment since 2000, which is likely to entail about $115 million in each of the next two years. BP is making a significant contribution to the site at Grangemouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now return to my hon. Friend's constituents, about whom he and I are concerned. I assure him that, after discussions, the Scottish Executive plan to mobilise the full available support to assist any staff who are likely to be affected by redundancy, at whatever level. Support will be provided to those affected through a local response team operating under the Executive's partnership action for continuing employment—PACE. That will ensure a co-ordinated and strategic response from local agencies in terms of offering advice, support and guidance that embraces, as my hon. Friend requested, retraining, reskilling, upskilling and employment opportunities. The support offered will be tailored to meet individual needs and local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
The company has given an undertaking to continue to work with local agencies, to prepare a robust action plan to broaden and enhance the economy of the whole area and to take an interest beyond its boundaries. That will include reusing some buildings and land for light industry, specialist advice, and assisting in the provision of training for engineering skills. Those leaving are likely to have good skills and to be able to compete well in the market, and BP has given a commitment to investigate redeployment opportunities in the BP group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tomorrow, Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley will present proposals to BP for BP's support for the repositioning of the local economy. I hope that my hon. Friend will be encouraged when he sees them. During the coming weeks, those proposals will be worked on in more detail to confirm the nature of BP's intervention, and to ensure that the beneficial impact on the economy is maximised and that public and private sector support is secured. A formal announcement of the action plan is expected in the first few weeks of January, including both immediate deliverables and a definition of work for the larger activities to be put in place in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work will be undertaken in a similar approach to that at Prestwick. I know about that from my experience in Ayrshire. Scottish Enterprise Energy Group is keen to help in bringing together employer and trade associations effectively to tie up vacancies, job specifications and people who are willing to move. It would be happy to offer similar advice to BP. There will also be opportunities to co-ordinate the recruitment needs of biotech industry clients through the PACE response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked about BP's reporting of its performance on its Scottish assets. That is a matter of concern for the company and its shareholders, but I hope that he is reassured by what BP told us about its plans for investment in Scotland. I will be keeping in close contact with it on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has understandable concerns about health and safety. As he has said today, a major concern with such a large redundancy programme is the continuing safety of the Grangemouth site. I can assure him that the Government place the continuing safety of the Grangemouth operation at the forefront of our considerations. The site is subject to the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999—COMAH. In relation to its restructuring, BP will have to submit risk assessments and substantially amended safety reports. The Health and Safety Executive will assess them and use them as a basis for future inspection plans. BP alerted the HSE to its intended reorganisation some time ago and is expected to submit more detailed proposals soon. The points about safety were reinforced when I met representatives from the Scottish TUC to discuss the Government's energy policy. I understand the concerns of the trade unions from first-hand experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COMAH regulations are enforced by a joint competent authority: the HSE and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency—SEPA. After assessing the revised safety reports, I can assure hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
Members that the HSE will examine particularly the company's methodology for managing the reorganisation and the human factors. The aim will be to ensure that change is managed safely and that the refinery continues to operate in accordance with the regulations. If the HSE finds that there are serious deficiencies in the proposed measures, it has the powers under COMAH to prohibit operations, although we hope that it does not come to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HSE's role as enforcer of health and safety law at the plant involves proactive and reactive inspection visits. As a result of the reactive work, it investigated three incidents that, as my hon. Friend said, occurred at Grangemouth in May and June 2000: an electrical power loss causing emergency shutdown; a high-pressure steam pipe failure; and a catalytic cracker fire. Those incidents, although disturbing, did not cause any serious injuries, but they resulted in an understandably high level of public, media and political concern in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the investigation into the incidents and BP's own audit carried out by a taskforce, the company initiated a major action plan. I can tell my hon. Friend that the HSE monitors that plan regularly and seeks to ensure that it is implemented. It will consider the implications for the action plan of BP's recent announcements, and if it believes that appropriate progress is not being made to implement it, enforcement powers can be used to address that. BP is currently co-operating fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can also tell the Committee that the HSE sent a report about last year's incidents to the procurator fiscal and legal proceedings are being instituted that are likely to be heard over the next few months. The timing is, of course, a matter for the procurator fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with most of the points that my hon. Friend raised. If any are outstanding, I shall be in touch with him in writing, as well as having further discussions with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the announcement by BP includes a significant number of redundancies, we are assured— and I take that assurance seriously—that the company's commitment to Grangemouth remains strong. I hope that members of the Committee are encouraged by that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a point that is not specifically about Grangemouth but about the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
of Scottish industry. In my constituency, Glaxo is selling off a factory and running down the work force. Does the Minister have anything to say about the problems faced by Scottish industry? It is not only Grangemouth that is shedding labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, but it would be inappropriate and difficult to do so in the last three minutes that remain to me. The hon. Gentleman and I had a roustabout earlier, but if he has genuine points to make and wants to talk to me privately about a particular industry, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East, I would welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that the Government and the Scottish Executive will continue to promote activities in partnership to support Grangemouth. We are working very closely with our colleagues in the Executive, as he is working closely with his MSP, Cathy Peattie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His reply was excellent and thorough and gives cause for hope. However, I hear alarm bells ringing in the work force, because the promised partnership and consultation are not as good as they need to be. Can he use the good offices of the Department for Work and Pensions to bring the sides closer together and facilitate more open revelation of the plans by the management team?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly undertake to discuss that further with my hon. Friend outside the Committee. In the meantime, I assure him that activities on the site will focus on the continuing safety of the operation and the needs of the work force, their families and the surrounding community, all of whom are likely to be affected by the redundancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that the necessary plans are in place to ensure that the operations at Grangemouth can continue within a safe environment and create the maximum benefit for the local communities. As my hon. Friend knows, I plan to visit the site in the near future. I look forward to him joining me on that occasion, and assure him that I will continue to work closely with him, his colleague Cathy Peattie and the Scottish Executive to ensure that his concerns are dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
