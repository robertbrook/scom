Social Inclusion</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.<br><br>
I take this opportunity, Miss Begg, to welcome you to the Chair. This is the first time that we have seen you in the Chair. It is a particular pleasure for me and for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to see someone who has been so active in this Committee taking the Chair. I hope that you will not have to intervene too often to keep us all in order. It is a privilege to see you in the Chair today.<br><br>
I also take the opportunity to point out that today is the birthday of the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan). Some of us will never see 37 again; I am quite jealous, bearing in mind his lowly status as a Conservative in Scotland—[<i>Interruption</i>.] It seems that our debate is so interesting that members of other Committees are seeking to join us.<br><br>
We are here today to talk about social inclusion. Whenever we reflect on the purpose of being in Government, we realise that it is a quest for social justice. We do not seek to govern for the sake of it but because we genuinely want to bring about change, especially for the most vulnerable in society. I have no doubt that today's debate will be about statistics and policy options, but underpinning that debate will be the values that inform our work.<br><br>
We have started the job of making a difference, but we have not finished it. The Government are committed to halving child poverty by 2010 and to abolishing it within a generation. One of the key steps that we have taken to promote social justice in Scotland is the establishment of a Scottish Parliament; devolution allows local matters to be handled in a sensitive and distinctive way. Its partnership with the United Kingdom Government means that Scots benefit from the macro decisions that put more money into the pockets of those who most need it.<br><br>
On social justice, as in other matters, the Government work in close partnership with the Scottish Executive. We have built a sound economy because that goes hand in hand with social justice, and that is exactly what we are achieving. We have provided the resources and reformed key public services in Scotland in order to help managers and staff to promote social justice and make a positive difference to society.<br><br>
One of our first moves as a Government was to change the nature of public services in Scotland. We introduced the new deal, which involved reforming the Employment Service. The new deal allows staff to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
treat people as individuals. Personal advisers have been allowed to do their job of providing professional and caring advice; and all of us, as constituency Members, come into contact with the changes that have been brought about in people's well being.<br><br>
We should pay tribute to those who have helped people with considerable difficulties make that important jump into employment. More than 76,000 people in Scotland have found jobs through the new deal. It has made a difference to many lives. It has helped 42,000 young people, 16,000 lone parents and 8,000 people over 50 into employment; and 10,000 people have been helped through new deal 25-plus. That was a considerable achievement for the Government and their advisers, and it helped people into work, even though many of them had lost confidence.<br><br>
The new deal will continue to work in Scotland, because the Government work together with the Scottish Executive, employers and individuals. We work with the private sector because social justice goes hand in hand with successful business, and I pay tribute to it for its participation in the new deal. The voluntary sector has also participated, and more than 500 voluntary bodies offer new deal placements, which is a great tribute to the sector's vitality. Last week, Cathy Jamieson—the Minister with responsibility for these issues—and I met voluntary sector representatives, and we discussed how important the new deal was to them. As regards participation in the new deal, my only criticism is of the public sector, which could learn much from the involvement of the private and voluntary sectors.<br><br>
Thanks to schemes such as the new deal, we now have record levels of employment in Scotland. The claimant-count unemployment rate is 4.1 per cent.—the lowest level for 25 years. The number of people in employment is 2,378,000—the highest level for a generation. Youth and long-term unemployment have been slashed by more than 70 per cent. since 1987. Those developments are transforming people's lives, giving them hope and making a difference.<br><br>
Our employment reforms have made work pay. The national minimum wage helps about 110,000 people in Scotland. I remember the debates that took place before we came into government about whether we would introduce the minimum wage. We have now shown the strength of our commitment by introducing it, and we have faced down those who said that it would destroy jobs. It is important to note that many more people are in employment now that we have the minimum wage. We have delivered on our commitment, and it has not destroyed jobs—far from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute.<br><br>
The minimum wage is being enforced. In Scotland alone, during the past three years, the Inland Revenue has identified more than £600,000 in wage arrears owed to low-paid workers. When the hon. Lady intervenes, perhaps she will explain how it feels to be a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
member of a party that could not even be bothered to turn up to vote on the national minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State, but we have heard all that before. I should like to ask her what plans the UK Government have to end the age discrimination inherent in the minimum wage scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the hon. Lady did not respond. She is undoubtedly embarrassed, as any sensible person would be, by the fact that her colleagues stayed in bed rather than voting the national minimum wage on to the statute book.<br><br>
Our advice from the Low Pay Commission was aimed at ensuring that we struck a balance between the national minimum wage and getting people into employment. The surest way to get people out of poverty is to get them into employment, and those of us who have worked for years to create more jobs in Scotland recognise how important that is. Reducing youth unemployment has been one of our most significant achievements.<br><br>
If we are to encourage people into work, we must ensure that it is allowed to pay. We have all seen the consequences of the poverty trap, which dissuaded people from going into employment, because they would end up poorer. The introduction of the working families tax credit benefits more than 122,000 people in Scotland. That money goes directly into their pay packets, and makes a difference for some of the lower paid in society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly give way, because I am in a challenging mood. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell the Committee how he can justify taking part in a debate on social inclusion when his party's leader said that he would not match Labour's spending plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am only too happy to recognise the Secretary of State's ability to read <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> so early in the morning. Is the answer to the poverty trap more or less means-testing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the poverty trap is to get people into jobs and to ensure that resources are directed at those who are most vulnerable. My right hon. and hon. Friends have said, day in and day out, that assistance has to be targeted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to continue with the point before I give way to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
As well as the working families tax credit, we have also introduced the children's tax credit, which pays up to £10.17 a week for up to 400,000 families in Scotland. From April, that increased to £20.17 a week for families in the year of a child's birth, when the money is most needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are providing support through targeted benefits. Does the Secretary of State recognise that that means that many more people come into contact with paperwork and form filling in order to claim? Things can go wrong, so it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
important that the voluntary advice sector is well funded and resourced. Does she think that that the Department for Work and Pensions should put some of its resources into the independent sector, to ensure that people can seek advice to ensure that they claim the right benefits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Various routes help to fund voluntary organisations so that they can give advice. One of the most important sources of advice for many people is Members of Parliament. I do not know about the hon. Gentleman's surgeries, but mine are full of people who come to ask about benefits and targeted benefits. It is important to ensure that MPs, as well as people in the voluntary sector, are sufficiently experienced and skilled to give the necessary advice.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the officials in the Department for Work and Pensions who have set up seminars in the House to help colleagues give such advice to their constituents. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I hear hon. Members mocking the idea of those seminars. Some people in the House think that they know it all anyway, but I have never shared that mindset.<br><br>
The working families tax credit and the childrens tax credit have directly attacked family poverty, especially child poverty. However, we want to do an awful lot more. Next year, we will reform the tax credit system to improve and simplify it. We will introduce the working tax credit, so that those without children can benefit. The new child tax credit will mean that for the first child, child benefit and the child tax credit will provide £54.25 a week to all families with incomes of less than £ 13,000 a year.<br><br>
Alongside that, we have improved statutory maternity leave and pay, and we will introduce paid paternity leave and adoption leave from next April. The sure start maternity grant has gone up to £500 from April, which is a huge boon for any family with a new child, especially poor families. Families are at the heart of our approach, for which we do not apologise.<br><br>
As a result of our changes to personal tax and benefit reforms since 1997, by April next year families with children will be on average £1,200 a year better off. Those in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average more than £2,400 a year better off in real terms. A single-earner family with two young children on half of average earnings will be £3,490 a year better off in real terms. A single-earner family on average earnings with two children will be £310 a year better off in real terms. Those figures show that we have made a difference. We have helped families with children, and shown our commitment to the poorest in our society.<br><br>
But the problems of poverty in Scotland have not disappeared. It will be a long haul to tackle all the problems, but we have started the job. We recognise that there is much more to do, and in partnership with the Scottish Executive we are determined to finish it. The work is not only about statistics. It is about individuals and their families who will benefit from initiatives such as the new deal and the working families tax credit.<br><br>
Social justice does not simply sit in a box labelled policy initiatives. It is about being prepared to act to

counter manifest unfairness. Asbestos victims and their families were at the heart of an initiative that had to be taken in relation to Chester Street, formerly known as Iron Trades, the insurance company that specialised in industries, such as shipbuilding, that involved high levels of asbestos. When it became insolvent last year, there was a risk that asbestos claimants could lose out. That was a particular concern in Scotland, given our asbestos legacy from the past. The Government acted. We brought together the key players to make progress on compensation, and we have gone a long way to resolving the sticking points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what my right hon. Friend is saying. It was a tremendous achievement by the Government to solve the problem within about four months, when the financial services industry had, once again, failed the people whom it was supposed to serve. Does she welcome the Fairchild judgment in the House of Lords? That matter was also causing misery to millions of people throughout the world. I know that she will work with us to ensure that people who are still suffering from asbestos receive their due compensation quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the opportunity to pay tribute to my hon. Friend. Few Members of this House have done more to get justice for asbestos victims. Like him, I have seldom had a greater sense of relief than I did when I heard that judgment. The difficulties that were encountered in relation to Fairchild were extremely complex and could have caused real hardship. I shall continue to remain involved in the issues. I pay tribute to colleagues across Government who have recognised the special Scottish interest in the matter and to my officials, who have gone out of their way to maintain—in some cases—daily contact with the companies involved, to ensure that there is no backsliding. We shall keep in there until we make sure that those who are entitled to payment receive it. More than £3 million has been paid out under the scheme that was put in place by the Association of British Insurers and the financial services compensation scheme.<br><br>
I come now to pensioners. The Government know that our pensioners deserve a decent future. When we came to power we recognised that while some pensioners were doing well, the poorest had not shared in the general prosperity. We therefore introduced the minimum income guarantee, which provides direct help for the poorest pensioners and benefits around 181,000 pensioners in Scotland.<br><br>
We have taken significant other measures to help pensioners. Free TV licences—a simple thing to do, but an expensive one—for people aged 75 or over were introduced, benefiting 300,000 people in Scotland. Often, the older pensioners are the poorer pensioners.<br><br>
Our introduction of winter fuel payments—increased to £200—was one of the best things that the Government have done. It put money into the hands of people when they most needed it, and gave them a sense of pride, especially coming, as it does, at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
the beginning of winter when people are thinking about their additional costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned that the older pensioners tend to be the poorer pensioners. Does she not recognise that one of the quickest and most targeted ways of reaching those poorest pensioners would be a greater uprating of the pension for those aged over 75 and older pensioners, to take more of them out of means testing and make it much simpler for them to get the money that they need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The introduction of the minimum income guarantee is intended to even out some of the difficulties that have occurred. It is a great source of comfort for pensioners, regardless of their age.<br><br>
I return to the winter fuel payment, which goes to every pensioner and benefits some 1 million Scots. Together with increasing the basic state pension by more than inflation for each of the last two years, it has benefited some 900,000 pensioners in Scotland. We have also guaranteed that the full annual basic state pension will rise by at least £100 for a single pensioner and £160 for pensioner couples in 2003–04, and that in future years the basic state pension will rise each year by 2.5 per cent. or the increase in the September retail prices index, whichever is higher. We have also reformed the state earnings-related pension scheme, introducing the second state pension, which helps people with broken work records. Carers who have had to give up their employment benefit from that a great deal.<br><br>
We have also introduced stakeholder pensions, and next year we will introduce the pension credit, which will make a huge difference for pensioners with small savings and will benefit around half of all pensioner households. I do not know how other Members feel, but when somebody comes to my surgery who, because they have a small occupational pension, misses out on everything else, I find that very frustrating. The pension credit will enable us to cope with that. It will mean that no single pensioner need live on less than £100 a week and no pensioner couple on less than £154 a week.<br><br>
There is currently real concern about the future of occupational pensions and, as the House knows, the Government commissioned two major reviews on occupational pensions and long-term savings. The review on savings reported yesterday and the Pickering review is due very shortly. The Government will examine those reviews very closely and bring forward proposals later in the year. We understand people's anxiety about the future, their savings and their pensions.<br><br>
The subject is close to my heart, because within a few days of our being elected in 1997 I was able to work with my colleagues to right the injustice of personal pension mis-selling. Five years on, that process is nearing completion and the Financial Services Authority estimates that £11.8 billion in compensation will be paid and 1.7 million consumers will have had their cases reviewed. I still get letters from members of the public who have received their compensation cheque in the post and remember that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
was a Labour Government that acted to end the scandal of pensions mis-selling.<br><br>
When we were elected in 1997, we knew that we had to tackle the problem of people in our society who felt marginalised. The new deal has brought hope to thousands, including young people, lone parents and people over 50, making a difference to their lives and giving them self-esteem as well as putting hard cash in their pockets.<br><br>
We are thinking ahead. As outlined in the Budget, the new tax credits are radical reforms to our welfare system to improve and modernise the support we provide. We have not forgotten those who have suffered as a result of their employment. We have made a difference to them and to their families, too.<br><br>
The Prime Minister made it plain that our commitment to halving child poverty by 2010 and abolishing it within a generation is a challenge. But it is a challenge that we are ready for.<br><br>
The Government and the Scottish Executive must think ahead, take action and then evaluate, and we will continue to do all of that, because we share a vision with the Executive of the future as opportunity for all—a society for the many and not for the few. Not just because that is morally right, but because using everybody's talents is good for society and good for the economy. In this area, head and heart go together.<br><br>
We know that we are on the right course and we will continue to work within Government and with the Scottish Executive to tackle the deep-seated roots of poverty that we inherited. I invite Members throughout the House to join us in that crusade.</span></p>
<p>10.51 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>John Thurso <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Miss Begg.<br><br>
I welcome this debate, which, as we contemplate the beginning of the summer recess, is timely. Many of the questions to which the Secretary of State alluded in her speech are ones that we will all face at our clinics and surgeries as we tour our constituencies, particularly those of us with large rural constituencies, some parts of which we can get to only in the summer because of the working week at Westminster.<br><br>
I also have no doubt that many of the actions undertaken by this Government since 1997 are extremely welcome. The Government have done much with which Liberal Democrats agree. We need to remind ourselves of the state of the country and the problems that we faced in Scotland in 1997, following 18 years of Tory rule. I recall a speech made by my late father in another place, about 18 months before he died, on the subject of local government reorganisation in Scotland. It was a most compelling dissection of the damage done to Scotland by Thatcherism.<br><br>
Let us not forget those Thatcherite ideas: greed is good; there is no such thing as society; if one cannot fight one's way up, get down—all alien ideas to Scots, who believe in community, working together and helping each other. That is the background to this debate, against which I have no hesitation in saying that Scotland is immeasurably better off today than it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
was in those dark days of the early 1990s. It will be at least a generation before we see more than one Tory in Scotland, given that the previous Leader of the Conservative party marched them up a blind alley and the current one has sat down to play blind-man's buff.<br><br>
I shall move on to the Government's achievements. Like the Secretary of State, I would say that the Government's single biggest achievement, which the Liberal Democrats welcomed and took part in, was the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Without a doubt, devolution has given Scots the ability to control their destiny in many important ways while sharing in the partnership that is necessary for dealing with macro events in the United Kingdom. Probably the most important way in which we can combat social exclusion is to ensure that the young receive a good education and that opportunities are available to them. Many achievements of the devolved Parliament promote that, such as the McCrone settlement, increased pay for teachers, and the abolition of tuition fees for those in higher and further education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned that tuition fees had been abolished. They have not. Only up-front tuition fees have been abolished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Thurso</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like her colleagues, the hon. Lady adores flogging a dead horse. If one asks any student in England where they would rather go to university, they will say that they would prefer to go to Scotland, where there are no tuition fees. Of course, the hon. Lady may be referring to the graduate endowment scheme. Frankly, I see no reason why those graduates who have successfully completed their education should not be asked, as they begin to earn in later life, to contribute something to those who come behind them and who may be less fortunate. However, the £10,000 threshold is low, and we, in this Parliament, should ensure that the threshold for student loans in England is raised and that the administration for the graduate endowment scheme is introduced.<br><br>
To continue on the subject of young people, it gave me great pleasure to support the legislation that introduced the minimum wage. At that time, I was chief executive of a leisure company, and many people in industry said that the minimum wage would be a disaster. I argued the exact opposite, saying that if we wanted quality jobs in the hotel industry, instead of a greater quantity of jobs, and if we wanted trained staff and productivity, we had to deal with the failure in the labour market and ensure that those at the bottom received a decent wage. In 1997, I was delighted to introduce a minimum wage of £4 an hour in my business and to support the Government in introducing that legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the hon. Gentleman for endorsing the national minimum wage. Does he agree that, when the Bill on the subject went through the House, the line that his colleagues took on regional variations in the wage would have caused an unmitigated disaster?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Thurso</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not say that there would have been an unmitigated disaster. The exercise was valid
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
intellectually. The proposition was well thought out and deserved consideration. Parliament made its decision. With hindsight, I might say that Parliament was right on that occasion. My party and my colleagues can reflect on how things change, and we can change our minds in the light of experience. I wish all politicians would do so. We are happy to say that the minimum wage as enacted has done the job.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) in that the different rates for adults and young people need to be re-examined. I shall take an example from the industry that I recently left. Why should a 19-year-old chef, fully trained and working in the kitchens, be paid less than a 22-year-old chef with the same qualifications who does the same work? I fully recognise the strong argument for a lesser rate for those in training, but fully qualified people aged over 18 should get the same rate for the same job, and I ask the Government to consider that.<br><br>
The Secretary of State mentioned unemployment and the new deal. The statistics are interesting. In 1990, unemployment was at 9.3 per cent. overall, which had come down to 7.6 per cent by 2000. I welcome that and, like her, I say that we should do more. Within that, however, there is a slightly disturbing trend. Male unemployment has come down only from 9.7 to 9.1 per cent. The counterpart to that is that female unemployment has come down from 8.8 to 5.9 per cent. While I obviously welcome the drop in female unemployment, it is a concern that male unemployment has not come down at the same rate.<br><br>
When considering unemployment statistics, we need to think of the background. In Wick in my constituency unemployment is around 7 per cent. When I visited the jobcentre to talk about that, the staff pointed out that approximately 50 per cent. of those unemployed in the area were the almost permanently unemployed, the long-term unemployed. The other 50 per cent. came and went and found jobs reasonably quickly.<br><br>
It is the long-term unemployed who deserve our full attention. Many of those people have been on the register for 20 or 30 years. They might never have worked in their lives, and they need help. Among them are people who are willing to work, but face special barriers. One of the first meetings that I had following the election was with People First in Caithness, an organisation for people with learning difficulties. I was sad to find that I had been at the Miller academy in Thurso with one of them. At that school, he had been regarded as a bit of a bully. I now understand that he was seriously challenged, in terms of mental capacity and his ability to learn.<br><br>
We need to consider what we can do for people who face such challenges. I welcome much of the mental health Bill, but it has caused a great deal of concern in communities of people with such disabilities. When the Bill is examined in the House, I hope that we will ensure that those people are properly looked after.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The unemployment statistics that the hon. Gentleman mentioned are not recognised by several of us, as our unemployment has fallen. However, I take his point about the long-term unemployed and I suggest that he considers action teams. I had the same problems with the long-term unemployed in my constituency, but we established action teams, and the scheme is making considerable progress. It is a good scheme, and I urge him to contact the Department for Work and Pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Thurso</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I already have a strong dialogue with the Department, with which I do considerable work.<br><br>
The figures that I mentioned came from the web, although I may not be very good at surfing it. They come from page 8 of a document entitled "Scottish Statistics 2001" and they contain International Labour Office assessments of the labour market. I shall be happy to give them to anyone who wants them afterwards.<br><br>
I want now to deal with pensioners. Those of us who are in work and who still have the opportunity to create wealth for the future can accept that the way in which society deals with pensions must change. There is a broad consensus that the old model is simply unsustainable and that we shall need new ways of dealing with pensions. However, some people have already retired, and they have their entire working lives behind them. They paid their stamp and they expected, as of right, that the state would make provision for them to enjoy a reasonable retirement. It is too late for those pensioners to make provision, and we have a duty to look after them, particularly elderly pensioners, as has been mentioned.<br><br>
I welcome the minimum income guarantee and the pensioner credit, but I have two specific concerns. First, whatever people may say, the provisions are complicated. Pensioners simply do not want to seek advice, particularly if they are proud and elderly—many are ex-service people—or if they live in distant rural areas. If one asks whether they know about this or that, they will accept help, but they will not ask for it on their own.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the citizens advice bureaux, which have done a tremendous amount of work on the issue; indeed, my attention was drawn to it by the work of the Wick citizens advice bureau. In a question to the right hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), who was then responsible for these matters at the Dispatch Box, I mentioned that 14 out of 27 pensioners at a luncheon club were under-claiming or not claiming their benefits. Very properly, as was his wont, he flicked me hard to the boundary. There are two things that people should do when they are in a hole: one is to stop digging and the other is to use it for lobbing grenades at the other side. The sensible point, however, is that the Government must consider how to make schemes simpler and how to reach the target that we all want to reach.<br><br>
My second concern as regards pensioners relates to the introduction of the universal bank—or the lack of it—and to the changes that will take place in post offices. I learned only a few weeks ago that those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
changes will start in September, when the last books will be sent out. The changes are almost upon us, but much of the hardware is not in place in post offices. I have grave concerns about whether we will be ready, quite apart from the fact that there are clear implications in the documentation that people will be pushed towards bank accounts. People should have the choice of staying with the Post Office and having a bank card with it. Again, that issue is particularly relevant to our sparsely populated rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Weir <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another problem could affect the two-thirds of Scotland's pensioners who still get their pensions paid through the post office? The rundown of the network could have serious implications for rural areas, because Consignia's definition of 90 per cent. of the population being within half a mile of a post office does not apply in many rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Thurso</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Indeed, many older people may be quite happy for their carers to take their pension books to the post office to get the money to go shopping and come back with the change and a receipt, but they are not happy to give their Switch cards to their carers and ask them to go the automated telling machine. In many parts of my constituency that would be rather difficult since we do not have such machines.<br><br>
The other factor that affects remote and rural communities is transport. Those of us who work in London or in any other great metropolis, such as Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness, have easy access public transport, and we can get to work and back on reasonable, regular and frequent public transport—sometimes. Those who live in Durness or other remote communities—when they are not being shelled by the Royal Navy—do not have the opportunity to go to work by bus or rail. That will never happen. The car is and will remain the only viable mode of transport in those communities.<br><br>
In that regard, it remains a scandal that those who have to use a car are penalised by the extra 10p, 15p or even 20p that they have to pay for fuel, over and above the prices in Inverness or other cities. That extra cost is not imposed by the garage owners, who have to operate on very thin margins. I believe that it is added elsewhere in the supply chain. The Government would do well to look at that, because someone somewhere is making money, and it is more likely to be the big oil companies than the little local garages. Transport is so important because social inclusion is not just about education or about not being poor. It is also about the right to leisure, to enjoy oneself, to play sport and to have access to culture. Transport is vital for all such activities.<br><br>
I suspect that most members of the Committee have the same objective. We all want to eradicate poverty and to increase opportunity for young people. We all want to ensure that the elderly have a comfortable and decent old age. In achieving much of that, the Government have and will continue to enjoy our support. However, as in so many areas where the Liberal Democrats are a little ahead of the Government, we will continue to press them to adopt some of our ideas. I note that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
independence of the Bank of England was to be found in only one manifesto—ours—but it has proved to be probably the best idea for the country's financial stability. I commend that manifesto to Labour Members, as it contains many great ideas, but we will continue to support the Government here and in partnership in Scotland on all those areas where, together, we can make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be able to call every Member to speak this morning, but that will obviously depend on contributions being brief.</span></p>
<p>11.13 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Miss Begg, for that introduction. I start by saying that social inclusion is largely related to poverty. Although the Government have done a great deal, I echo the election slogan that many of us used—much done, much still to do. There is undoubtedly a tremendous amount still to be done. The male unemployment figures in my constituency show that more than 15,000 or 11.4 per cent. are still unemployed. That figure compares dramatically with those in the constituencies of Liberal Democrat Members, some of whom represent the more prosperous areas of Scotland. In West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine it is 1.5 per cent. and in Gordon, 1.6 per cent. Both of those constituencies are larger than mine, but male unemployment in the two of them combined is less than half that in mine. The Government have not adequately tackled that disparity. Undoubtedly, a great deal has been done for individuals across the board, but there has not been the necessary area focus. While I am glad to say that unemployment in my constituency has fallen considerably—by 38.7 per cent.—in the past five years, in West Aberdeenshire it has fallen by 48 per cent., in Gordon by 47 per cent. and in neighbouring Eastwood by 38 per cent. Unemployment is falling more slowly in the areas that have the highest unemployment than it is in those where it is already lower. The danger is that if there is a turndown, the areas that are worst off and have been improved least will take the brunt of any difficulties before others. That is why we need to focus on particular geographical areas.<br><br>
I listened to the youth unemployment figures given by the Secretary of State. My area, like others, has displayed a tremendous decrease in youth unemployment, but I do not believe that that represents a movement of young people into employment. The figures register those unemployed and claiming benefit. There is a vast, unregistered, under-group of youngsters who have turned to a variety of illicit means of bringing in cash, or who have dropped out of the economy altogether, are not picked up by the official statistics and are ignored by the existing system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Anniesland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is talking about people caught in the benefit trap. Does he agree that there are people who were caught in it in the late 1980s and early 1990s who have never managed to get a job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to those caught in the benefits trap. The national minimum wage,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
particularly at the level at which it is set for young people, is an insufficient incentive for many young people in my area to choose work and legitimate enterprise as distinct from crime, drug dealing and other nefarious means of making a living. The income that can be gained from drug dealing is far higher than that which can be obtained by working on the minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Roy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell and Wishaw)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend give us a figure that he thinks would encourage drug runners to work? If he is not satisfied with the minimum wage, what limit should it have?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that intervention. I would start off with a universal £5 minimum wage, as called for by the Transport and General Workers Union. I would have that right away for all those who are entering employment and I hope that my colleagues would see fit to support it. The road into drug dealing does not start with the BMW, it starts with small-scale dealing, making petty change, and with drugs being seen to be a more attractive financial option than the small amounts of money that are available via gainful employment. We should look at ways in which we can provide adequate role models for young people in areas of deprivation, and the Government should do a number of things in that regard.<br><br>
I return to the problems mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (John Robertson). The poverty trap is far more substantial in Glasgow than elsewhere, because of the balance between the wages that people are likely to get on the existing minimum wage and their deductions. Once they start paying their council tax and their rents they earn less, because rents and council tax are far higher in Glasgow.<br><br>
The city bears an unfair share of the public services burden in the west of Scotland and has been inadequately supported by central Government and now by the Scottish Parliament for some considerable time. The surrounding local authorities do not contribute towards services in Glasgow, but their citizens use them. Until such time as the Government manage to devise a system that overcomes the penalty of high rents and high council tax faced by residents of Glasgow when seeking work, I fear that we will be unable to make the drastic reduction in unemployment that areas such as my own need.<br><br>
As I said before, we need an increase in the national minimum wage for a variety of reasons. A substantial number of people in my area are in receipt of tax credits of one sort or another and they find the system enormously complicated. The means-tested system is far too complicated, is inadequately understood by many of our citizens and, perversely, does not provide an incentive to work, because many of the people involved do not understand how well off they would be if they were in work. They are often happier once they are in work and receiving the benefits than they thought they would be when considering whether to take work, because we do not adequately explain the position to them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important and valid point, so will he join me in welcoming the practice adopted in Jobcentres Plus in areas such as my constituency? Whenever anybody is offered a job, their entire benefit entitlement, including whatever tax credit they might be entitled to, is explained to them in detail. Does that go some way to addressing the problems about which my hon. Friend spoke?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am aware of that practice and it goes some way towards overcoming the difficulties—once somebody is in the position of being offered a job. But many people in my constituency shy away from being forced into a job. The mechanism needs to be simpler, more easily understood and more information should be made available from an earlier stage.<br><br>
In addition, the tax credit system is not helping us politically, because it is seen by many of my constituents, and I am sure by many others, almost as an act of God rather than as something that a Labour Government have deliberately decided to provide in order to make them better off. There is a contradiction in that we are spending huge amounts of money and getting little political benefit in return. That is not just a partisan point, because it also relates to perceptions of the role of the state in generating employment and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rosemary McKenna <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that it was difficult to get people into work. The Government have done a great deal to make it easy for people to access jobs. I represent an area with low unemployment, and I do not think that other local authorities are doing enough to improve the transport links into those areas where there are jobs. Does he agree that local authorities, as well as the Government, have much responsibility to improve the situation and allow people access to jobs by improving the transport infrastructure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that instructive point on a topic that I was intending to move on to later. In an area such as my constituency, there are no adequate bus services after certain hours of the night and at weekends. For those of my constituents who have to work in the more antisocial jobs in terms of hours and conditions, public transport does not exist. They frequently find themselves unable to take up such jobs when they are offered. They are also unenthusiastic about taking the jobs because they do not appreciate how much better off they will be through the tax credit system, because they do not understand it. Therefore, they do not get as far as being made offers and having the system explained to them.<br><br>
A low minimum wage acts to subsidise bad employers. Labour shortages are developing in several areas of the economy, so to encourage employers to hoard labour or use it inefficiently by making it cheap is not necessarily the best approach for the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Tynan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that those in employment, who are not even on the minimum wage but receive working

families tax credit, receive a tremendous boost to their incomes and are removed from poverty? The best way to overcome his constituents' problems is for people who are benefiting from that system to pass on the information by word of mouth to colleagues and friends. If the minimum wage were set at £5, would it not create problems of employment for smaller companies, which might not be able to raise their wages to that level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept my hon. Friend's point about the perils of raising the minimum wage to £5, although I understand that he is making it in a constructive fashion. That rate is the minimum that we should consider in the short term. I accept that the tax credit system provides gains and benefits, but the figures demonstrate unequivocally that it is not working effectively in my constituency. More needs to be done. Given that the system does not work for an area such as mine or for several other areas of Glasgow, simply reiterating the present solution is an inadequate response. We must consider other possible improvements that could be made.<br><br>
I come to the question of social inclusion and health. A major issue of fairness arises from inequalities in life expectancy. In my constituency, the latest figures show that less than 50 per cent. of my constituents are expected to live until 75, while in neighbouring Eastwood that figure is more than 70 per cent. and in some areas of the south of England is more than 75 per cent. It is simply unfair that life chances should depend on where one happens to live and be brought up.<br><br>
The Government should consider the issues of nutrition, food and diet. The system of food production is deliberately designed to keep food prices high and keep the quality of food consumption low for the poor. Schemes have been set up with Government funding that are deliberately designed to provide cheap fruit and vegetables, while the overall strategy is designed to drive up those same prices. If we want joined-up Government, we must operate a system of agricultural support that is designed not to keep food prices high and create welfare dependency but to drive prices down and make produce available at world rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to have succeeded in persuading the Secretary of State that farmers are welfare dependent. I am not sure that she meant to agree with him, but she did. As fruit and vegetables are not covered by the common agricultural policy, does that not rather put a hole in his argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point, but substantial quantities of fruit and vegetables are covered by the CAP. Surely the hon. Gentleman has seen pictures of tomatoes and a host of other agricultural products being dumped? Does he accept that the average family in my constituency, as in his, pays £20 a week more in higher food prices than it would if food was available at world rates? The present policy is almost deliberately designed to drive up food prices and make cheap, healthy food unavailable to those in greatest need.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
I accept that the Government have done a great deal for pensioners. I welcome the principle of flat-rate payments, particularly in relation to winter fuel, and TV licences for everyone over 75, irrespective of need. The minimum income guarantee has brought a substantial income to many, but a large number of pensioners in my constituency do not claim it, for a variety of reasons. They are not unaware of it; local churches and community councils and I have tried in many ways to ensure that everyone who is eligible is aware of the scheme. However, for pride and other reasons, pensioners will not claim what they see as charity. In those circumstances, we must recognise that the minimum income guarantee is not reaching all those whom it was designed to reach. We must consider a greater role for flat-rate payments to ensure that we reach the largest possible number of poor pensioners, particularly in areas such as mine.<br><br>
The Government might have to be prepared to consider policies that are area-focused, rather than, as they are now, individual-focused. I remember the days of Strathclyde regional council—a number of current Labour Members were involved in it—which had a strategy of accessing services in areas of multiple deprivation to ensure that additional money and resources were provided. Those areas suffered from a concentration of poverty as well as from a poverty of ambition. Only by focusing on them were we able to improve matters.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will spend more time on trying to bend the spend; that is, ensuring that mainline services focus more of their spending on the areas of greatest need. We need a larger number of role models for youngsters in my constituency and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder where my hon. Friend spends his time. Has he not heard of social inclusion programmes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Not only have I heard of them, I am on the board of the social inclusion project in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend does not sound as though he has heard of social inclusion programmes because they do target particular areas, as do the area teams, which have been mentioned, and the step up scheme. A number of specific programmes target particular areas and, in my area, that works. My hon. Friend seems to go around with blinkers or dark glasses on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is perhaps too easily satisfied. The amounts of additional spend that are focused, certainly through the social inclusion programme in my area, are marginal compared with the scale of the problem and with the amount of public spending in Glasgow and the west of Scotland. It is not just a question of focusing small amounts of additional money; it is also about making sure that we bend the major spend to focus on the areas that are in greatest need.<br><br>
A degree of lip service has been paid in some areas to additional spending. What we need is a spending pattern on a scale that has not previously been

achieved. If we want to genuinely break away from areas of multiple deprivation and the large-scale poverty that continues to curse large parts of the west of Scotland and elsewhere, we need to make a quantum leap in the amount of spending that we undertake. That is a major issue. What we have done so far is unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ann McKechin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the recent transfer of housing stock to the Glasgow housing association and the huge amount of funds that will be spent on renovation and rebuilding are classic examples of how we are putting money into the poorest areas of our cities and creating new jobs and opportunities for training to acquire new skills?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Potentially, that is a considerable step forward, but although we have had a Labour Government for five years, we have not yet seen evidence of that spending. In fact, we received less money in the short term than we had anticipated because of the prospect of a housing trust being set up in Glasgow. I have spoken for some time on this issue because this is the only occasion on which I have made a speech in the Scottish Grand Committee. This is the most important issue to my constituents; something on which we can really make a difference. The Government have achieved a great deal, but there is still much more to do. I hope that the next time that I speak on this subject, I will be able to say that much more has been done. But I dare say that there will still be more to do, because we will never be satisfied until we are ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat my appeal for short speeches because I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to speak on this important issue can be heard.</span></p>

I do not like to intrude on private grief, but having heard the swingeing attacks by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) on many Government policies, I have certainly been convinced not to vote new Labour.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of the stark reality of life in Scotland at the beginning of the 21st century. It is a country where one in three children is brought up in poverty, where one in four pensioners live in poverty and, as was alluded to by the hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a little progress before I give way.<br><br>
Scotland is a country where the life expectancy of men and women is the lowest in the whole of the European Union. What a damning indictment that is of this new Labour Government, both in Westminster and in Edinburgh, and what a damning indictment of successive Tory and Labour Governments in London.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for giving way, particularly as she has just attacked the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan), the representative of the Tory party. Will she explain to the Committee why, on Monday 8 July, in the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation considering the draft State Pension Credit Regulations 2002, she voted with the Tories to deny £2.3 billion to British pensioners and to deny £400 to the average pensioner in Scotland, affecting improvements to half Scotland's pensioner households and imperilling 500 new jobs in Dundee? We cannot take her contribution seriously until we have received an explanation for her actions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple explanation for the Secretary of State.

I was informed on Monday that the Committee was sitting, so I had no time to review 50 detailed pages of regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is clear that the hon. Lady is not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For decade after decade, the people of Scotland have placed their trust in Labour in the expectation of securing social justice. Time after time, they have been let down and neglected. I believe, and recent polls show, that that traditional trust in Labour is eroding gradually but inexorably, and that there is an ever-increasing awareness that the only way to secure social justice in Scotland is to reclaim the powers of a normal and independent parliament.<br><br>
The new Labour Government have chosen to hold a debate today about the impact of their policies on the promotion of social inclusion in Scotland, so I want to look at the facts. Let us start with rural poverty, a problem that, generally, is simply ignored by Labour. The outlook for rural Scotland has never been so bleak, with every sector of the rural economy struggling to survive. In evidence to the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, the Scottish Executive's then Communities Minister—she went on to be the Minister responsible for many other matters—admitted that one in four people in poverty lived in rural areas.<br><br>
In my constituency, and elsewhere across Scotland, small businesses have struggled to survive. There have been job losses after job losses, low pay scales and lower take-up of benefits, notwithstanding the sterling services of the citizens advice bureaux, as was referred
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
to by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Anne McGuire)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has painted a brief picture of Perth, but would she like to tell us its unemployment rate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The unemployment rate for Perth is, fortunately, among the lowest in Scotland. However, the Under-Secretary may not know that the level of pay there is also among the lowest in Scotland.<br><br>
In rural Scotland under new Labour, our farmers face the prospect of financial ruin. Average farm incomes are as little as £6,000 a year, as even the Under-Secretary may be aware. Our fishing communities are in decline, and there has been an exodus of our young people, who must leave to find jobs elsewhere.<br><br>
What has new Labour done to alleviate the problems? It has given us the highest fuel tax in the industrialised world, which is a disaster for rural Scotland, where transports costs are a key component of the rural economy. New Labour has strangled small businesses in red tape and significantly increased their operating costs. Of course, in Scotland we again have higher business rates than in England, because our estimable First Minister, Jack McConnell, decoupled the rates poundage when he was Finance Minister.<br><br>
The Labour Government have treated our farmers with disdain. As we have heard, only yesterday the Secretary of State showed once again her acute understanding of what is happening in rural Scotland when she agreed with the description given by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok of farmers as welfare dependants. I am disappointed that she has not taken the opportunity to apologise for that disgraceful slur on our farmers and rural communities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Lady will answer a question that has caused me some concern for the past 12 months. We have heard about the poverty and plight of farmers, and about incomes being as low as £2,000 a year. She will know that foot and mouth blighted my area and the neighbouring area of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale last year. People lost their livestock, which gave them the opportunity to look long and hard at their future. If the farmers had gone through such a bad time in previous years, why did they all go back into the business?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not take the opportunity to apologise for the Secretary of State's reference to farmers as welfare dependants. Foot and mouth was a terrible crisis for farmers across Scotland, but the problems that face the rural economy were there long before it. The crisis simply exacerbated the situation.<br><br>
Time and again, our fishermen have been sold down the river by Brussels because successive Governments have happily traded away our vital fishing interests for deals that were not in Scotland's best interests.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok made an excellent contribution, but I should like to add a few
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
words. How has Labour fared in our inner cities? The hon. Gentleman criticised many Government policies; we, too, would like to look at some of the Government's policies in this area.<br><br>
Not all of those hon. Members who represent Glasgow constituencies have attended the debate. Those who are here will be aware that Glasgow features prominently among the poorest constituencies in the United Kingdom. As a Glaswegian, I know only too well the stranglehold that Labour has had in the city for decades at local and parliamentary level. The question that must be asked is this; what has been the net benefit of total Labour dominance, decade-in, decade-out, during the previous century and this? The answer, I am sorry to say, is continuing poverty and deprivation on a truly shaming level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for baiting me, a Glaswegian who has lived in the city for many years. I ask her to pay a visit to Glasgow and then tell us that it is not a great city.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Lady been to Drumchapel?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been there. I know Glasgow well. As a Glaswegian and a Scot, it shames me that the city should suffer such terrible poverty and deprivation.<br><br>
Glasgow has the second highest rate of households in the United Kingdom with no earner in the family, and some 40 per cent. of the city's population live in an area of deprivation. In Glasgow, the scourge of drugs blights many communities. We see increasing homelessness in the city, and people there are struggling to survive day by day. That shames me, a Scot, and it should shame every hon. Member here today—[<i>Interruption</i>.] Clearly, in light of Labour's laughter, it does not.<br><br>
What has Labour done for cities such as Glasgow? The Government have set a target for the eradication of child poverty; and by what date are we to see this? Not until 2020. What a limited ambition we see around us in this so-called mother of Parliaments. That truly dismal target means the consigning of a further generation of children to an upbringing of poverty. Labour has presided over massive job losses and increased unemployment. The Government have retreated on their target for dealing with people sleeping rough on our streets. The 2002 target has become a 2003 target, and a further postponement can doubtless be anticipated.<br><br>
In short, Labour has talked a lot about poverty for 50 years, but has done very little about it. In 1997, Labour pledged to reduce means testing of benefits, but what has happened? They are about to extend massively the means testing of pensioners by way of the State Pension Credit Act 2002.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have given way several times, and I wish to make progress.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0541">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
The Government have massively extended means testing at a time when some 750,000 pensioners do not claim the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled. The Government provide benefits on the one hand, and take them away with the other. The operation of the working families tax credit is one example of that; it is not interlinked with council tax benefit or housing benefit, which creates and enhances the poverty trap that faces many citizens.<br><br>
With respect to benefits for disabled people, we see a Labour Government forcing people to go through the hoop for benefits to which they should be entitled. I am thinking in particular of the shambles that is the disability living allowance. Some Labour Members are shaking their heads, but if they got out more and spoke to their constituents they would be hard-pressed to find one who had had a good experience of applying for disability living allowance.<br><br>
The Tories abandoned the basic principle of discretion in the benefits system, and new Labour has refused to reintroduce it. Discretion is a basic principle of natural justice in any administrative system, and it is shocking that new Labour has decided to stick with the Tory policy. The lack of discretion has resulted in misery for many thousands of people, who have found themselves caught up in the mindless bureaucracy of the social security system. It has taken away the dignity of people such as a young constituent of mine, who has been in and out of hospital and who is now trying to stand on his own two feet. His income is a few pounds above the basic income support level, and he receives incapacity benefit. He applied for a social fund grant to help furnish a small flat that he had managed to obtain with local authority help. The Department for Work and Pensions told him on 23 May 2002 that he could have the princely sum of £379 to furnish his flat with basic items. He was told that he could have a cooker and a bed, but not a washing machine and a chair. What kind of society are we living in, when such situations arise? That is the reality of new Labour's policies, and it is unacceptable to my party and me.<br><br>
How can we justify paying asylum seekers less than the basic income support level? If income support represents a basic level of income, below which no one should fall, how can we justify giving asylum seekers less? Why do the UK Government intend to exclude asylum seekers' children from mainstream schools? Whey do the Government lock asylum seekers up in places such as Dungavel? Why do they not allow asylum seekers access to the employment market so that they can contribute positively to the society in which they find themselves?<br><br>
I could go on all morning, but I am conscious of the fact that other hon. Members want to speak. I conclude by reiterating what I said at the beginning of my remarks. Real social justice has not been achieved in Scotland, and Labour has not delivered and cannot deliver for Scotland. It is instructive that 16 Labour Back Benchers have not even bothered to turn up to this important debate on social justice. The only way to secure real social justice in our country is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
to equip ourselves with the necessary tools. Those include control over our resources, which will allow us to grow our economy and create wealth. In short, we need the powers of a normal and independent Parliament.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said in her opening remarks that achieving social justice in Scotland would be a long haul, but the fact is that Labour has had its time. It has presided over continuing poverty and decline and it has treated the people of Scotland with utter contempt. Labour's time is now up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I again repeat my entreaty to hon. Members that they keep their speeches short.</span></p>
<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Sheridan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Renfrewshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having once been told that there was no such thing as society, I find today's debate refreshing and welcome. We face many challenges today, but none is more important than raising the living standards and the aspirations of those who sent us here.<br><br>
Living and working in a diverse constituency, I see tangible evidence of the gap that remains between the most affluent and influential people in our society and those who live in deprivation, and we must deal with that. I firmly believe that the Government have put in place a structure for creating a more equal and fair society. Their measures include the new deal, pension improvements and, more importantly, the creation of the right environment for businesses and people in communities to prosper.<br><br>
At the risk of incurring the wrath of my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy), I must admit that I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok on the contentious question of the level of the minimum wage. I do not think that it is over-ambitious to propose a figure of around £5. That would not deter people from becoming drug dealers and drug runners, but it would certainly improve the quality of people's lives.<br><br>
That is why social inclusion can be achieved only by partnership between employers, trade unions and Government. However, with social inclusion come social responsibilities. I welcome the consultation on entitlement cards. There are people in our communities, including my own, who take advantage of the most vulnerable in our society whose lives are ruined by financial difficulties, and I welcome the Proceeds of Crime Bill that is making its passage through the House.<br><br>
Through the trade union movement and other voluntary organisations such as the children's panel, and subsequently through my interest in politics, my quality of life has greatly improved. That is why we must make every possible effort to engage our young people in constructive dialogue. There are far too many in our society who feel left out and consider that they have nothing to offer. Nothing could be further from the truth, and unless and until we convince our electorate that their participation in every aspect of our life is valuable, social inclusion will be even harder to deliver and the social misfits will win the day.<br><br>

The only obstacle to progress on social inclusion is the unthinkable return of a Conservative Government at Westminster. Even more worrying is the unthinkable thought of the nationalists gaining any influence whatever at Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p>11.57 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I commend the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) on keeping his remarks short.<br><br>
First, I thank the Secretary of State for her kind birthday wishes. Naturally, a Scottish Grand Committee sitting on 10 July was in itself present enough. It is always a pleasure to witness the robust opposition provided by the Liberal Democrats on such occasions, as demonstrated by the quite incredible consensual opening remarks of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). These have indeed been 37 hard years on me and I am wearing terribly badly. My other birthday present was the arrival of so many Tories at the start of the sitting. However, I realised that that was caused by a Room change that had gone wrong.<br><br>
This is a debate on social inclusion, but I would have entitled it "Social Exclusion", because I want to make certain specific remarks about those who are excluded. The Government's social inclusion unit has defined social exclusion as
<br><blockquote><p>"a shorthand term for what can happen when people or areas suffer from a combination of linked problems such as unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime environments, bad health and family breakdown."</p></blockquote>
Responsibility for social inclusion crosses the devolution divide, a point with which the hon. Gentleman struggled valiantly at the start. The Scottish Executive are accountable for many policy areas that impact on poverty and social exclusion, such as health, education and housing. However, responsibility for social security benefits, taxation and the Employment Service lie with this House. This is a suitable subject for discussion here, given that the Westminster Parliament has a crucial role to play in key policy areas that can significantly reduce social exclusion.<br><br>
The Scottish Conservatives, as I know hon. Members are aching to hear, have now correctly identified the crucial role of the community and community-based organisations, thus creating a framework that embraces all people in areas suffering from social exclusion.<br><br>
The extent of poverty in Scotland is alarming. The Scottish households survey conducted in 2000 shows that an incredible 42 per cent. of households have no adults in work and that 20 per cent. of unemployed adults have been so for more than five years. As we have heard, the gap between the top and bottom 10 per cent. in our society is growing. Some 52 per cent. of households in Scotland have a net annual income of less than £10,000, which is less than half the average United Kingdom income. While households with families on council estates are the likeliest to be in the lowest income bracket, many single-parent households worry constantly about money issues.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How would the hon. Gentleman sum up the Thatcher years as regards social inclusion. Would he say that they were a success or a failure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed to lose in the lottery—it was 24 minutes before 18 years was mentioned. However, I will take entries for the next sitting.<br><br>
Surely the lesson is that all the aspects of deprivation are interlinked and we ignore them at our peril. In 2000, the Scottish Affairs Committee was told that Scotland faced huge challenges and that in rural areas more than 350,000 people were living in poverty, and issue that I addressed in my Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall last autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will not address the failures of the past, will he address the future? How does he reconcile his arguments with the fact that the leader of the Tory party has decided to abandon all the pledges given at the last election to match the spending of the Labour Government? How on earth does he reconcile his concern about poverty with his leader's unwillingness to match our commitment to spend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To answer the right hon. Gentleman's point, which I accept that he makes in good faith, I point out that whatever the party in charge in the past 50 years, all policies have failed, with the result that 350,000 people are living in rural poverty. We must review those policies and move on to ones that will work in future.<br><br>
The Government's approach to social inclusion is too centralised: time and again, targets of agendas for social inclusion are urban-centric and fall far short of the task of addressing rural problems. Although rural communities suffer similar problems to urban ones, such as crime and poverty, the solutions required differ significantly. In my constituency, the average incomes in Galloway are the lowest in the United Kingdom; there are significant pockets of stubborn unemployment, to which the job losses at Stena Line in Stranraer, at West Freugh, and at Aprilia at Castle Kennedy have added significantly in the past six months. In rural communities, small numbers of job losses can create huge pockets of significant unemployment that cause great difficulties.<br><br>
It is excellent news that in a place such as Whithorn, people can attend a benefits check and have their working families tax credit worked out for them, as we have heard. I compliment the Jobcentre Plus network for the work that it is doing in that regard. When the nearest benefits agency is 40 miles away and there are no buses after 6 o'clock at night or before 10 in the morning, it is a logistical nightmare to have one's benefits checked, especially given the ever more complicated benefits system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tynan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish the hon. Gentleman a happy birthday, although this must be a terrible way in which to spend it. Has not the deregulation of buses created enormous problems, and is that not the real reason why buses do not run after 6 o'clock?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. However, if I could draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the point that was made earlier, although we have the lowest average

incomes in the United Kingdom in Galloway, we have some of the highest percentages of car ownership, because there is no alternative to the car. People with very low incomes are driving cars that they cannot afford to fuel. That point has not been addressed in the past five years. [<i>Interruption</i>.] If these Scottish Grand Committees are to mean anything, speeches need to be short so that Back Benchers can contribute. I should like to make some progress.<br><br>
That kind of exclusion sounds a direct warning for all politicians. Recent elections have shown a decline in turnout throughout the electorate. The whole population is disillusioned with the political process, but the trend is particularly acute among the most disadvantaged. When almost half the households in Scotland are not engaged in the economic process of our country, is it any wonder that they turn their backs on politics?<br><br>
While dealing with social exclusion, we must encourage civic engagement—before the apathetic and the disengaged become the majority. It is depressing that a substantial part of Scotland's population continues to be excluded from the mainstream of society, struggling in communities whose key public services are in crisis, despite five full years of the Government's promised good intentions.<br><br>
The national press has rightly reported in detail my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition's highly-publicised visit with David McLetchie to the housing estates of Easterhouse in Glasgow. The visit exposed the Labour party's failure over many generations to use its dominance in such communities to achieve anything but a continuing cycle of decline, while shining a light upon small local projects—often run by the voluntary sector—which make a huge difference to people's quality of life.<br><br>
That accords with my experiences in similar estates in my constituency where the communities of, for example, Stranraer and Kelloholm continue—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mohammad Sarwar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Glasgow city council made various representations to the previous Conservative Government to write off huge debts against housing, and every time the request was turned down? That is one of the reasons for poverty and bad housing in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly acknowledge that. I would also take the opportunity to welcome the vote in Dumfries and Galloway that was announced a few days ago. Council tenants have voted by 66 per cent. to 33 per cent. to take their housing stock into the private sector. That is an imaginative move. We shall press for them to hold true to the promises that they have made during the voting process. We need to trust communities a lot more and to lose our obsession with policies only being deliverable by major Government Departments. We must give more power to communities, families and independent institutions; that is the best way of making Scotland a better place for all in society.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
The Conservative party believes that strong independent local institutions are far more likely than the central state to improve the quality of life in our cities and in our countryside. The innovation, commitment and flexibility of local bodies are better than monopoly provision and central direction. The Government should work hand in hand with local communities.<br><br>
Key to all of this, however, will be the Scottish Executive's delivery of public service improvements. Our community's most vulnerable depend on it. The failure of the Executive's law and order policies is less of a problem for those who can afford to move away from those communities most blighted by street crime or drugs. Its failure to tackle the waiting lists in our hospitals is not an issue for those able to buy their way into private health plans. Its abject failure to take seriously rural transport matters least to those with company cars and most to those in isolated communities and thus least able to access transport links.<br><br>
The solution to Scotland's persistent social exclusion problems lies in the ability of us all to find a solution to our key public service issues. We will continue to fail until we trust our communities a lot more and our spin doctors a lot less.</span></p>
<p>12.8 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the time I shall try to limit my remarks to a single aspect of the Government's social inclusion policies—their effect on pensions and pensioners. The challenge of ensuring that everybody is able to enjoy dignity and security in their retirement is at the heart of social inclusion—or at least, it should be. If it is not, nothing is.<br><br>
In 1997, the incoming Labour Government were bequeathed a pension system that exacerbated inequality in pensioner incomes. The incomes of the bottom 25 per cent. of pensioners fell rapidly in relation to those of the rest of the population, while those just above that level saw any small saving or second pension that they had accrued wiped out by the loss of other benefits. They were often no better off than their neighbours who either could not or would not save. In addition, many employers were in the midst of national insurance contribution holidays that would eventually take £19 billion out of the pension fund. Today, we are reaping the whirlwind that those holidays helped to sow.<br><br>
In the private sector, the rush to entice employees out of perfectly good occupational schemes and into wholly unsuitable private ones created the greatest pensions mis-selling scandal that this country has witnessed. It has cost the industry about £13 billion to compensate for that fiasco, and that is a further £13 billion that should have been in the pension fund today. It took a Labour Government to sort the problem out. Finally, the previous Administration changed the rules on inherited SERPS—but forgot to tell anyone. That was another scandal that we inherited in 1997.<br><br>
Our first priority was, and must remain, to alleviate pensioner poverty. There were those who said that all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
pensioners should benefit equally, regardless of their income, but I disagree. To me, social inclusion means giving the most to those who need it most. By introducing the minimum income guarantee—soon to become the pension credit—we have ensured that the poorest pensioners' incomes have risen well above the rate of inflation and the rate of average earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Anna belle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I sat on the Standing Committee that considered the State Pension Credit Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is when the hon. Lady voted with the Tories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am talking about the Bill's Standing Committee. However, I want to ask the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Cairns) what estimate has been made of the likely take-up of the new benefit, given that it involves a massive extension of means-testing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but the policy that she and the Liberals support would target extra resources on the basis of pensioners' ages, not their incomes. A wealthy 73-year-old would therefore receive more than a poor 65-year-old. That is not social inclusion.<br><br>
The hon. Lady heard me say many times in Committee that take-up was a key element. The Government have estimated a take-up of two thirds in the first year, and that will increase in years to come. That is why we established the Pension Service.<br><br>
The hon. Lady speaks disparagingly about means-testing, but we must pick out what the Scottish National party's policy would entail. The poor 63-year-olds will have to wait until they are 75 to get the extra help promised by the Liberals and the SNP. How will they get extra help? By undergoing the means test. It will, therefore, be retained, but only for the poor. How on earth is that social inclusion? How does one help to reduce the so-called stigma of means-testing if one's policy enshrines means-testing for the poor, while giving the better-off over the age of 75 extra support, irrespective of whether they need it? That is not social inclusion.<br><br>
The minimum income guarantee helps the poorest, but we must ask about those with modest second pensions or modest savings above the minimum income guarantee level. Until now, there has been no in-built impetus in the system for them to save, because they have often found themselves no better off than the pensioners next door who made no effort to save.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman seen the recent analysis suggesting that anyone who retires now with a pension fund of less than £100,000 will accrue no net benefit from all their saving over the years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the savings gap in a passage at the end of my speech, and the hon. Gentleman is right to highlight that issue. What would not help, however, is the Conservative policy of moving the basic state pension from the state to a funded alternative, an approach that the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has actively canvassed. How shall we improve matters by moving the basic state
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
pension into the funded system lock, stock and barrel? I shall return to the relevant passage in my speech later.<br><br>
From next October, the savings credit will reward many of the pensioners whom I mentioned. On average, pensioners will be up to £400 a year better off. Some 2,700 pensioners in Greenock and Inverclyde are already benefiting from the minimum income guarantee, and more will benefit from the savings credit next year.<br><br>
To take up the point made by the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan), people are simply not saving enough for their retirement. The pensions system is highly complex, and few people can confidently claim fully to understand it. This is true of both the public and private sectors. The pension mis-selling scandal and the recent downturns in the stock markets have shaken people's confidence in the system, and discouraged them from making early and adequate provision. At the same time, average life expectancy is increasing, which has created a tension in the pension sector not only in the United Kingdom, but throughout the rest of the world.<br><br>
To tackle those enormous challenges will require a concerted effort that the Government cannot make alone. If we are to ensure the dignity and safety of all tomorrow's pensioners, we need nothing less than a new national consensus on future pension provision, to build a partnership between public and private providers and employers as well as employees. Every political party in Scotland has a duty to spell out to pensioners and future pensioners their exact policies in that vital area. Failure to do so will be seen as an admission that they either have no policies on the subject, or have them but want to keep them secret.<br><br>
For the Government, the framework is clear. First, we believe in the basic state pension as the foundation for pension provision in retirement. The letter written by the hon. Member for Havant mentioned the "powerful and compelling vision" of a funded alternative to the basic state pension. Where would it be funded? In the private sector. The Conservatives are talking about nothing less than the wholesale privatisation of the basic state pension. That is their policy.<br><br>
Secondly, we believe in rewarding rather than punishing people with modest pensions and savings on top. Every other party represented in the Committee supported amendments that would not have based extra help on the income of pensioners, but on their age. We fundamentally disagree with that proposal, which would not mean social inclusion.<br><br>
Thirdly, we believe in providing a minimum income to the poorest pensioners, an income that has increased by 30 per cent. since 1997. Fourthly, we need radical reform to support occupational pensions. Too many companies today simply walk away from commitments to their employees by closing defined benefit schemes. To deal with that problem requires a thorough review of the complexity and degree of regulation in the savings industry as a whole, as well as long overdue tax simplification. Yesterday's Sandler review and tomorrow's Pickering report should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
provide the basis for a national debate about the way forward for the funded pension sector.<br><br>
Tough challenges will face us, and I shall pick one out. Should there be an element of compulsion in second pension provision? [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] A debate on that would be extremely sensible, and those hon. Members who agree with me might contribute on the subject. For most employees, compulsion already exists in the system via national insurance contributions. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has pointed out, every taxpayer pays 4p in the pound in tax to provide pension schemes and entitlements for those who have not, could not or would not make provision for themselves. That is compulsory; we have no say in providing that support through the taxation system. Universal compulsion on second pension provision may not be practical or desired, but a combination of compulsion and incentive may have to be considered if we are to close the savings gap.<br><br>
Those vital questions cannot be avoided. At the heart of the issue lie the simple principles of dignity and security for those in retirement, and social inclusion for all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Five hon. Members still want to speak. Far be it from me to suggest for how long they should speak, but if they keep their comments to about five minutes, they should all have time before I call the Minister.</span></p>
<p>12.18 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Carmichael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your words to heart, Miss Begg, and have carefully noted my starting time.<br><br>
I want to shift the focus of the debate slightly away from economic social inclusion. Before I do so, I want to pick up on a couple of points that have been made. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) made a valuable contribution to the debate, as he had something to say. He referred to unemployment statistics in constituencies such as that represented by my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith). The unemployment figure in both parts of my constituency is low.<br><br>
I caution the hon. Gentleman against placing too much stress or extrapolating too much significance from such bare statistics. When jobs in my constituency are lost, it often means people having to move away from Orkney or Shetland—usually on to the mainland. That is part of the constant drip of depopulation which is a crucial factor when considering social inclusion. Many unemployed people in my constituency do not appear in the statistics because they are doing a part-time job, or even more than one such job. Others are self-employed. Some hon. Members referred to the high number of farmers who are self-employed and to their low incomes; and others may be working in seasonal jobs that produce some money in the summer but leave them struggling to make ends meet in the winter months. Poverty is to be found in many different
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
forms in all parts of Scotland, and one cannot always find it simply by looking at statistics.<br><br>
The point made by the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) about the disability living allowance will have to be addressed by the Government. A couple of weeks ago, I attended the annual general meeting of the Orkney citizens advice bureau. The manager's report said that the bureau represented 14 people in appeals against the refusal of DLA last year and lost only one case. A strike rate of 13 wins and only one loss on appeal suggests that something is fundamentally wrong with the mechanics of the allowance. My surgery experience suggests that in the first instance the answer is always no, and that only later is the appeals system allowed to deal seriously with cases.<br><br>
The debate has so far focused on social inclusion or social exclusion, as defined in economic terms, but that is only part of the story. Geography and transport can often act as tools of social exclusion. Social inclusion is essentially about making opportunities available to all, regardless of means or of geography. The Government have failed to grasp the full concept of social inclusion or exclusion in so far as it is affected by geography.<br><br>
The Millennium institute of the University of Highlands and Islands is a good example of an education opportunity that is potentially socially inclusive. It allows many imaginative opportunities for people in my constituency to undertake distance learning. However, it depends on good quality access to the internet, which ultimately depends on broadband access. Those who live on the island of Westray in my constituency are lucky during the winter months if they can connect to the internet at anything over 18 kilobytes per second. Come the summer, when the beasts are out in the field and the electric fences have been turned on, connection is impossible. The Government tell us that telecommunication regulation and the broadband can be achieved by using competition as a tool. That may be fine for urban areas, but a one-size-fits-all policy will always fail communities such as mine.<br><br>
I have spoken at previous sittings of this Committee and in the House about the cost of flights, which greatly curtails access for many of my constituents to many health and education services. That is recognised in virtually every other European Union country that has island communities. France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal all recognise that the cost of flights is linked to economic prosperity and the opportunity for social inclusion. However, when I raised the subject in Westminster Hall recently, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), said that the Government's policy was not to intervene. That policy is wrong and should be reconsidered. We cannot continue to adhere to the notion that one policy fits all. The Government have made significant inroads into social exclusion, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) has said. We now need a little more imagination in order to make further progress.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0546">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
<p>12.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ann McKechin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome today's debate on a subject that has been central to the Government's policies since the 1997 election. As has already been stated today, the Labour Government have a proud record of achievement, especially on unemployment, the most important area of social exclusion. The Government have the ambition and commitment to achieve full employment and raise the standard of living for the very poorest in our communities. For the first time in many years, the gap between the richest and poorest in our country has stopped widening, which is no small achievement.<br><br>
Many of the measures introduced by the Government are specifically targeted at the lowest income groups. Steps, such as the introduction of the minimum wage, the new deal schemes, the tax credit scheme for working families and increases in child benefit, together with the success in providing a stable economy and increasing investment in public services, have borne fruit. With the national minimum wage and the integrated tax and benefit scheme—here I take a slightly different view from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson)—we are moving away from a welfare system to a system of entitlement, whereby those who have a child receive the same amount of assistance, whether they are in work or not. That gives us the structural building blocks to maintain social progress and achieve lasting change.<br><br>
The changes in my constituency in the past five years have been dramatic. I am proud to say that we have had the biggest drop in unemployment of any west of Scotland constituency. In the past year alone, the number of unemployed claimants fell by 17 per cent. In the past five years, the number of unemployed people in Glasgow has fallen by more than 15,000.<br><br>
As I am sure the Minister would agree, this is not a time for complacency. In Glasgow and other socially deprived areas of Scotland, the legacy of the wasted years of the 1980s and 1990s is still all too apparent. The challenge now is to build on the advances that we have made, to use the new opportunities that arise from economic growth, particularly in areas such as Glasgow, and the significantly higher public investment for the benefit of the poorest in our society, and to tackle the problems that afflict so many of them.<br><br>
In sizeable areas of Glasgow—I make no apology for mentioning Glasgow again—the majority of the adult population are not in work. They are either on the unemployment register or, more commonly, on some other form of benefit. In some areas, that group comprises as much as 70 per cent. of the local population. Glasgow has more incapacity benefit claimants than any other city outside London, including Birmingham and Manchester. That is the nub of the problem in Glasgow, where the employment rate is 55 per cent., compared with a Scottish average of 51 per cent. The Scottish Council Foundation published an interesting report last month, which said that for Glasgow to achieve the average figure for employment in Scotland, an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
additional 40,000 jobs would have to be created in the city. That is why I welcome the Government's proposals to merge the Employment Service and the Benefits Agency into Jobcentre Plus, to offer the increasingly personalised service that claimants require and, in particular, to target the hidden unemployed in such areas and offer them opportunities to get back into work.<br><br>
We realise that, as we tackle those problems, more public funding will be required if we are to assist people back into work. Many suffer from chaotic lifestyles, drugs and alcohol abuse, as my hon. Friend rightly stated. Many have no direct family experience or work routine. Most suffer from low competence, poor communication skills and low educational standards. If we are to beat the spectre of depressed soulless housing schemes, people need to see work going on around them. Even in my constituency, which suffers from the eighth highest unemployment rate in Scotland, there is a shortage of small industrial units for private firms or traders and a shortage of space for community-run industries. We need to focus on spreading job opportunities throughout our communities, not only in city centres. It does not suit every worker to travel to work, especially if they have dependants, young or old. Many women require the convenience of living near their workplace.<br><br>
We also need to ensure that our public transport system supports our workers, and not just in rural areas. In Glasgow, which has a high dependency on public transport, more services across Greater Glasgow are needed rather than routes revolving around the city centre. There is no easy fix and that is why we have to ensure that all appropriate agencies, whether in the public or the voluntary sector, work together effectively.<br><br>
To give an example, Glasgow city council recently announced a new and imaginative project to address some of those very problems. In three low employment areas it will actively promote a full employment initiative, giving a three-year job guarantee to applicants, with the aim of permanently raising the overall employment level. Already, through the good efforts of my colleagues in the Glasgow group of MPs, the Department for Work and Pensions has visited the city to determine whether the proposal can be developed on a national basis.<br><br>
That is an excellent example of how different strands of both local and national Government can work together to bring new solutions to those who need the help most. We have achieved much in the past five years and I am sure that this Government will continue their commitment in the years to come to achieve high levels of employment for all our communities.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mohammad Sarwar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in such an important debate. We often discuss injustice and abject poverty elsewhere in the world, but our calls for action overseas will mean little if we tolerate injustice and lack of opportunity in our own constituencies. The welcome and thoughtful
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
contributions to this debate clearly demonstrate the strong commitment of right hon. and hon. Members to tackling poverty in Scotland. Social inclusion should rightly be at the heart of policies enacted in this place. We should always strive to end poverty, aiming to give everyone a warm, secure home and every child a decent start in life. We must also fight for jobs and make work pay, bringing full employment and dignity at work to communities all over Scotland.<br><br>
The strong record of this Labour Government demonstrates a clear commitment to tackling social exclusion in Scotland. In my own Govan constituency, more people are in work than ever before. Local unemployment is down by 37 per cent. since the Tories were voted out in 1997 and youth unemployment is down by 87 per cent. I welcome the keen interest of the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) in the affairs of Glasgow and I hope that she will seek representation in Glasgow in the coming elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sarwar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, two of my colleagues still want to speak, so I must make some progress.<br><br>
More than 2,000 hard-working local parents are also now guaranteed a decent take home pay for their families every week thanks to the working families tax credit. The new tax rate of 10p has helped people off benefit and back to work while families have the lowest tax burden for 30 years.<br><br>
In my constituency, 3,100 pensioners receive the minimum income guarantee. Some 4,000 pensioners have potentially benefited from the free TV licence for those aged 75 or over, and some 10,200 pensioners aged 60 and over received a winter fuel payment of £200 per household.<br><br>
We are also beginning to see the real benefits of partnership with the Labour-led Scottish Executive to fight poverty and bring social justice to communities across Scotland. Nursery places are being provided for all 3 and 4-year-olds, but there is also extra support for families in difficult circumstances.<br><br>
I must praise the work of Homestart Pollokshaws and the Govan initiative. Homestart offers practical help to parents with young children in and around Pollokshaws. Its work has developed radically in recent years, as significant numbers of families fleeing persecution overseas have been housed in the area. It is fitting that the practical support offered by Homestart is based in Pollokshaws, once home to the renowned red Clydesider, Jimmy Maxton.<br><br>
Govan has also benefited greatly from the social inclusion partnership set up as a direct result of this Government's commitment to tackling poverty. Substantial funding has been allocated by Scottish Ministers to make Govan a better place for everyone who lives there. As one of 48 social inclusion partnerships across Scotland, it is receiving a share of over £190 million of Government funding. The local community can set its own priorities in deciding how to allocate the money on the ground and is backed by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
strong support from Government and public agencies in promoting social justice.<br><br>
Employment opportunities should be the cornerstone of social inclusion. We all define ourselves by what we do in work. Creating jobs and making work pay must always be at the heart of our agenda to fight poverty in Scotland. The Govan initiative has been active in bringing jobs to an area that suffered industrial decline in previous decades. Will the Minister assure me that the Government will continue to look imaginatively at ways of encouraging businesses to locate in the communities that have the greatest need for job creation?<br><br>
The national minimum wage is perhaps the greatest single achievement of this Labour Government. The Conservatives and other opponents said that it would cost 100,000 jobs in Scotland, but the reality is that more than 120,000 low-paid workers have been lifted out of poverty. Of those, 90,000 are women. Will the Minister reaffirm the commitment to increase the minimum wage in future years and maintain a threshold of decency for every worker in Scotland?<br><br>
In five years, we have seen a great deal of progress in promoting social inclusion throughout our country. Our Labour Government is tackling poverty to end exclusion in our communities. The opportunity to work for a fair day's pay must always be at the heart of that vision.</span></p>
<p>12.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Tynan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate because, as other hon. Members have said, it is important. We must remember 1997. When the Labour Government were first elected, one of their first decisions was to establish a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. It is important to remember that the Parliament was endorsed by a referendum and that all parties were involved in securing the vote.<br><br>
The people of Scotland had a wonderful expectation that they would see a different type of Parliament. It was going to be different from Westminster. It would be transparent and accountable; it is, especially with the Committee system. The Parliament was also going to be consensual, and Labour and the Liberal Democrats have lived up to that ambition. However, the Scottish National party and the Conservative party have been nitpicking and looking for division when there should have been support for the people in Scotland who need it most. It is unfortunate that we see the same performance from the Scottish National party in the Scottish Parliament as in Westminster. The partnership in Scotland has delivered policies. It is taking people out of poverty, and I am sure that the beneficiaries of those policies—the people who are being lifted out of poverty—would be horrified by the contribution made by the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) this morning.<br><br>
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson), I am proud of the Labour Government's record and the policies that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
adopted. I remember covering a factory as a union official during the long, dark years of the Tories, where temporary contracts had become the norm. Those contracts lasted two years, which meant that people were divorced from the opportunity of participating in trades unions and had lower wages and standards because they were temporary workers. That was a disgrace. The fact that workers had to be in the job for two years before they could apply for an industrial tribunal created those conditions. Unemployment was created; not intentionally, but because successive Tory Governments were totally incompetent. Unemployment is an important issue.<br><br>
I want to highlight two issues. First, Scotland now has 200,000 pre-school education places, but single parents—male and female—have problems accessing work. A close friend who is a nurse at Hairmyres hospital would find it impossible to work if she could not place her children in a pre-school environment. After-school clubs also provide the opportunity for youngsters to develop and for parents to work.<br><br>
Secondly, progress to work is one of the most important issues. In the 2001 Budget statement, the Chancellor announced a £40 million initiative over three years to help people with a history of drug abuse to return to work. It is important, along with other employment policy issues, to help people who are rehabilitated from drugs back into work. If we can deliver progress and help, we can tackle the problems of communities throughout Scotland and provide them with real benefits.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>John Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Anniesland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Miss Begg. You have obviously saved the best until last, as I am arriving on the graveyard shift. Time is short and I want to hear my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary's closing remarks, so I shall be the knockabout act.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) said that some of my colleagues should go out more and talk to people; if she came back to planet Earth, she might be able to get on with people better than she does on planet Zog. As for the Tories, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) made an excellent contribution, but never answered my question about the Thatcher years. The Tories would abolish the new deal if they had the chance. As usual, the SNP has offered nothing in the way of policies or clear-cut initiatives. I had hoped that the hon. Member for Perth would develop some arguments in her speech, but she was obviously too concerned about people going out more.<br><br>
The progress to work initiative is important and will prove to be a great success. People with a history of drug abuse have problems and the initiative is about getting them back to work. I commend all the people involved in it. I hope that it will assist and support, rather than preach to and sentence, addicts and that all hon. Members will support this initiative.<br><br>
I have many pensioners in my constituency and I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Perth saying on 3 July that one in four of our pensioners lives in poverty. She asked an excellent question and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
received an excellent reply, but I would have been more impressed if the hon. Lady had turned up the day before at the Opposition debate on pensions. Not a single member of the SNP was present. When a Whip has only five people to look after—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. It should not be too difficult to get at least one out of five Scottish National party Members to contribute to a debate on pensioners in Scotland. They did not turn up for a debate on the minimum wage; they did not get out of their beds. They did not turn up for the pensioners of Scotland, and then they have the cheek to ask questions. As everybody knows, researchers ask the questions, not Opposition Members. [<i>Interruption</i>.] They may barrack me; I love it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many questions does the hon. Gentleman ask?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: More than the hon. Lady thinks. The Scottish National party would get on much better if it supported the people of Scotland, and did not try to lead them down the nationalist road. It has only one agenda, which has nothing to do with the poor in society, nor with the people of Scotland. After the hon. Lady's remarks about Glasgow today, I look forward to another 10 Members of the Scottish Parliament getting voted out next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for listening to my advice. I am glad that I could call all who wished to speak.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Anne McGuire)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to attend the Committee today under what is technically your chairpersonship, Miss Begg. You and I go back a long time, and we will not forget those years, nor the 18 months in the lead-up to the 1997 general election. I wish you every success in your new role on the Chairmen's Panel.<br><br>
I thank the Committee for a wide-ranging and, on the whole, constructive debate. I shall talk about the part of the debate that was not constructive in a few minutes. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) can rest easy; I am not talking about him. I also thank the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) for the welcome that he gave to the Government's proposals in general. We should remember his phrase that Scotland is immeasurably better than it was in 1997. I thank him for that comment, as it is sometimes easy to criticise in politics, but not to praise. I also thank the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) for a thoughtful contribution that highlighted some of the issues that affect his constituency, and those will be taken on board. I reassure him that I checked the figures on the numbers of people who receive DLA, which last year increased by 5 per cent. to 2.2 million people.<br><br>
I also praise my colleagues on this side of the House for their constructive approach to the debate. I include my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
despite his somewhat pessimistic approach. I have known him for a long time, so perhaps I can tell him that. He looks at a glass and says that it is half empty, not half full. Having said that, I know his conviction in trying to challenge unemployment. Through the long years of Tory Government, he was there at the forefront, challenging the Tories' view of unemployment as a solution to all sorts of economic problems, and their failure to take a constructive approach. He said that unemployment in his constituency had decreased by 38.5 per cent. He said also that pensioners in his constituency were benefiting from the minimum income guarantee, and young people from the minimum wage. We should not deny his enthusiasm for making things better—a goal that unites us all—nor disguise the fact that he also identified obvious advances made by the Government over the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly vote Labour again. [<i>Laughter</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McGuire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a convert. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] My apologies. He knows that I do not mean it. I was, of course, referring to the Co-operative party's campaign on labels.<br><br>
The subject of my hon. Friend's optimism brings me to the pessimism and destructive comments made by the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing). When I listened to her descriptions of Perth and of Glasgow, I wondered how she managed to travel around Scotland and how the SNP had managed to lose 16 general elections since 1945 if the position was that bad.<br><br>
Let me place Perth in perspective. When I asked the hon. Lady to give the unemployment rate for Perth, she did not know; it is 2.5 per cent., well below the Scottish average. Since 1998, unemployment in Perth has dropped by 36.4 per cent. In her fair city, which she represents with the most jaundiced view of politics that we have heard for a long time, the employment rate is 81.6 per cent., which is above the Scottish average of 73.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McGuire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not now, because I want to talk about the hon. Lady's attitude to the State Pension Credit Bill. She has an incredibly old-fashioned attitude to means-testing. We all agree that, in the past, means-testing was about trying to exclude people from income; now, through the pension credit system, we are encouraging people to claim more income. By constantly reiterating the word "means-testing", the hon. Lady does a grave disservice to a number of people whose income we are trying to increase. She might want to address that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has raised a number of matters. I shall deal with them briefly and ask some questions. On the issue—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Lady that interventions should be brief and should constitute a question to the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for that direction, Miss Begg. I intend to keep my intervention brief. The Under-Secretary referred to my constituency, so it is appropriate of her to allow me an opportunity to respond. I had said that the unemployment rate in Perth was low. The important point was that, according to a table produced by Perth and Kinross council—on which the Labour party sits with the Tories in coalition—the level of pay is at the bottom end of the scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McGuire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A question must be asked about the double standards of the SNP, and the political chameleons that operate within it. If the hon. Lady is so worried about low pay, she should ask the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) about the fact that, when he was leader of the SNP, not a single member of the party could stay through the night in this House to vote for the national minimum wage.<br><br>
The hon. Lady also made quite disparaging comments about Dungavel. Indeed, I was astounded that my right hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) managed to continue making his speech during those comments. There has been much misleading information about the conditions in Dungavel. The people who were there last Friday, including my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy), can tell anyone that the conditions in Dungavel are nothing like the picture painted by the hon. Lady and her party.<br><br>
When it comes to debates about Scotland in this House, the SNP has nothing to say. It has nothing to say on welfare reform. The party promises even higher benefits, but never says how it would fund them. As I said, I am not at all surprised that the party has lost 16 general elections since 1945. Lest we forget, it was not only the national minimum wage that its members forgot to turn up to vote for; they also forgot to vote for the legislation on the financing of the new deal programme, which has helped so many people in Scotland. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I am sorry that the hon. Lady thinks that the new deal is boring.<br><br>
Some hon. Members have suggested that the household below-average income statistics show that the Government strategy is not working. I utterly refute that. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling)—now Secretary of State for Transport—said, the statistics show that
<br><blockquote><p>"for the first time in a generation poorer households are sharing equally in the nation's rising prosperity".</p></blockquote>
The proportion of Scottish children in low-income households, using the absolute measure, fell to 21 per cent. in 2000–01, 13 percentage points lower than in 1996–97. It is still too high and we will work further to reduce it. Using the absolute measure, the percentage of pensioners in low-income households has dropped by 15 percentage points from 1996–97 to 13 per cent. The figures show that the incomes of people at the lower end of the income distribution have grown substantially since the Government took office in 1997.<br><br>
Let me be frank with the Grand Committee. The Government are not scared of seeing our policy results
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
being measured. Our "Opportunity For All" annual report on poverty has a set of indicators for monitoring progress year on year. I commend the Scottish Executive's excellent annual report on social inclusion, which has its own set of indicators. Hon. Members may be aware that the Government recently issued a consultation paper on measuring child poverty, seeking views on the best way to do that. Officials from the Department for Work and Pensions recently came to Scotland to hold a consultation seminar on the proposals. We plan to engage with the various organisations, the voluntary sector and local authorities to look for a measurement of poverty on which to agree. These proposals are radical. They suggest for the first time that all aspects of poverty should be measured so that we do not just have a simple headline indicator.<br><br>
I turn now to the impact that some of our policies have had on women. Most of the people in Scotland who have benefited from the new deal for lone parents are women. Some 70 per cent. of the people who benefit from the national minimum wage are women, helping to close the pay gap. Together with the working families tax credit, the minimum wage currently guarantees every family with a child and at least one person working 35 hours per week a minimum income of £230 per week, or nearly £12,000 per year.<br><br>
We are also taking other action on equal pay. We are funding the Equal Opportunities Commission to prepare a voluntary model for employers on pay reviews to check that employers' own internal systems are fair. We are reforming employment tribunals to simplify equal pay cases. We should not forget—I hope that the hon. Member for Perth will remember this when she talks to the pensioners in Perth—that two thirds of the people entitled to the new pension credit will be women. I take on board the comments of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross about how we need to work carefully with the Post Office to ensure that the new system for claiming benefits and getting cash works efficiently from the beginning. The worst thing that could happen would be that pensioners do not get the money on the day that they expect to get it.<br><br>
As many hon. Members have clearly identified, social inclusion is multi-dimensional; it is not a single issue at which we can point. Years ago we just talked about poverty and thought that it was to do with lack of money. It is not, although that is important. That is why the Government have put such emphasis on getting people into work. That is the biggest lift that people can get in income terms. Social exclusion is about low expectations. It is about children not understanding that education is a great liberator for them. When our parents told us in the 1950s, 60s and 70s that we had to get educated, we realised that it was the one thing that stayed with us for the rest of our lives and granted us access to all sorts of other things. Many Labour Members appreciated that and I suspect that many Opposition Members did too.<br><br>
Social exclusion is also about poor health, poor housing and the lack of access to educational opportunities. We should celebrate the fact that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
nearly 50 per cent. of young people in Scotland are now going to university. When I went to university, the figure was around 6 per cent. of the population. Tackling those inequalities is at the core of the Government's policy. Our strategy for Scotland is to work in partnership with the Scottish Executive to tackle those problems.<br><br>
I will leave the Grand Committee with one or two final points. Since we came to power, the poorest 20 per cent. of Scottish households have an extra £1,300 in their pockets; the poorest 20 per cent. of Scottish households with children are £2,200 a year better off; and the poorest 20 cent, of Scottish single-parent families are £1,800 a year better off. We are not complacent, but we have achieved a great deal in a short time.</span></p>

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the Committee do now adjourn.—[<i>Mr. Jim Murphy</i>.]</p>
<p>1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Miss Begg. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important subject. A quick look at <i>Hansard</i> will show that nuclear power is a subject that is debated all too rarely. There was a Scottish National party Opposition day debate on 5 March under the heading "Nuclear power." Regrettably, in practice, we were subject to an attempt by the nationalists to indulge in constitutional navel-gazing. An opportunity seriously to consider nuclear power and Scotland's contribution to energy production was wasted.<br><br>
Fortunately, energy—and nuclear power—is back on the political agenda. The renewed interest has been stimulated both by the Cabinet Office's publication of the Performance and Innovation Unit's energy review and the consultation on future energy policy that stemmed from it. Reponses to that consultation will help to formulate the forthcoming White Paper on energy, which is eagerly anticipated by many people in my constituency; particularly the 400 workers who are employed at Chapelcross nuclear power station near my hometown of Annan.<br><br>
Chapelcross, which is owned and operated by BNFL, is one of the oldest nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom. It was the first in Scotland, being commissioned in 1959. From that day until now, it has played a significant part in the community, proving to be one of the better employers locally; it has also served the national grid well.<br><br>
Despite over-capacity in electricity generation in Scotland, an incident at Chapelcross last summer showed how important the plant's capacity is to the local area. The incident centred on the dropping of a fuel rod basket during the re-fuelling process at a reactor shutdown, and led to an instruction to shut down the other reactors in order to recover the situation. I hasten to add that at no time was there any danger to the work force, the environment or the wider community. However, when it looked as if all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0551">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
four reactors might shut down, Scottish Power expressed anxiety that there might be power reductions in the area. Thankfully, one reactor remained operational.<br><br>
Another recent incident brought home the importance of the site as an electricity provider. As my hon. friend the Under-Secretary will be aware, since April 2000, Ofgem has been conducting a public consultation exercise about the principles on which access to, and charging for, the Anglo-Scottish electricity interconnector should be based, and has issued a series of consultation papers on the subject. The last of those, in December last year, was the final stage of that consultation process. It set out for agreement a system of allocating access that proposed a reduction for Chapelcross.<br><br>
Faced with genuine fears that that would have an adverse impact on the economic viability of the Chapelcross site, the work force and the local community rallied round superbly. Within weeks, petitions signed by more than 6,000 people were being presented to Ofgem. The Scotland Office—particularly my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State—also gave its support to Chapelcross, and that was appreciated by the work force.<br><br>
With such an outcry, but also the realisation that the early closure of Chapelcross would have an impact on the security of the transmission network in the local area, Ofgem helped to accommodate a deal to allow the sale of Chapelcross's electricity within Scotland, which again emphasised the importance of the site.<br><br>
Chapelcross, with the 14 other operational nuclear power stations in Britain, continues to play a vital role in electricity generation, contributing a quarter of all electricity in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To amplify the hon. Gentleman's point, on the eve of the visit to the station that I made a couple of months ago, there was a double trip at Torness. It was Chapelcross that supplied the guarantor in Scotland, so it was a significant event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He is quite right. Although Chapelcross is regarded as a small station in the wider scheme of things, generating just under 200 MW, the reality is that it still plays a vital role. In Scotland, where as well as the Magnox Station at Chapelcross, there are two AGR stations at Hunterston and Torness, nuclear power provides 50 per cent. of our supply.<br><br>
Nuclear energy also makes a significant contribution to the economy. The nuclear sector contributes well over £3 billion to the GDP, employs more than 30,000 people and contributes positively to the balance of payments, with £600 million a year. We also know that nuclear power, as the only major energy source that does not involve discharging massive quantities of carbon dioxide, contributes significantly to Britain's commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 10 per cent. of 1990 levels by 2010. Indeed, nuclear generation reduces United Kingdom carbon emissions by between 11 and 22 per
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
Cent. or 12 and 24 million tonnes of carbon, depending on whether we assume it would otherwise be replaced by gas or coal generation. Every one of the workers who has contributed to the nuclear industry at Chapelcross, at the other nuclear power stations throughout Scotland and in the whole of the United Kingdom has much to be proud of.<br><br>
The current licence for the Chapelcross site was due to expire around 2008–10, which would have gone well beyond the 25 to 30 years originally expected. However, on 21 June, BNFL announced that the site would cease generation by March 2005 at the latest, and we now have a major task to try and fill the gap that will be left both in employment and energy production.<br><br>
The local area has, over recent years, regrettably been on the receiving end of some serious job losses. Nestle, Elopak and ICI, where I was previously employed, are companies that no longer exist in my constituency. I single out those companies because, like BNFL, they offered jobs in the local economy that were recognised as being well paid, offering their employees a standard of living that was almost impossible to match in many rural areas.<br><br>
Despite these major job losses, unemployment continues to fall, but unemployment figures alone do not give a true picture, as we have heard. Dumfries and Galloway, despite the introduction of the national minimum wage and the working families tax credit, still remains one of the lowest paid areas, if not the lowest, in Scotland. We have heard a lot about soaring house prices across the United Kingdom, but a study reported in one of the national Scottish Sunday newspapers recently suggested that house prices in Dumfries and Galloway had actually fallen, although they now appear to be on the rise again. That shows that, despite low unemployment, major economic problems exist in some rural areas.<br><br>
It is estimated that BNFL, as an employer, contributes anywhere between £15 million to £20 million per annum towards the local economy, and that will not be easily replaced. Scottish Enterprise in Dumfries and Galloway has commissioned DTZ Pieda to carry out an economic impact study into the closure of the site. Although some work remains to be carried out on the study, there are already indications that the closure of Chapelcross will have an impact on more than just the local area.<br><br>
What options are likely to exist for employees at the Chapelcross site? It has a work force of around 430 people who, with an average age of 45, are still economically active. They are highly skilled, with transferable skills, and would be a real asset to any future employer. After generation ceases, there will be the matter of decommissioning, which will meet the needs of a fair percentage of the work force for a number of years. Some, after having worked 20, 30 or more years will settle into retirement or will look for a little part-time job to enhance their pension, and to allow them to remain economically active. However, it would be a tragedy if the only option open to those who are left, and the many young people in the community who might have wished to seek quality,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
well-paid employment locally in the nuclear industry was a local economy plagued by low pay.<br><br>
As well as a the gap in the local economy that will be left by the ending of electricity generation at the site in 2005, there will also be the gap left in our energy production. As most hon. Members will know, not only will Chapelcross soon begin decommissioning, but, over the next two decades, so will all the current nuclear reactors in Britain. By 2023, only one of Britain's existing nuclear power stations will be functioning; Sizewell B in Suffolk.<br><br>
As a consequence, the Department of Trade and Industry's published energy projections, which take into account these closures and assume no new nuclear builds, state that the share of UK nuclear will decline to just 17 per cent. or 18 per cent. of total electricity production by 2010, and to just 7 per cent. or 8 per cent by 2020.<br><br>
The UK will become increasingly reliant on gas. Government predictions estimate that it will provide 70 per cent. of electricity generation by around 2020. That puts too many energy eggs in one basket and there is some doubt as to how secure that gas supply will be, as it will come largely from the middle east and Russia.<br><br>
So what are the alternatives? The same Government predictions that foresee a dash for gas suggest that renewables can contribute at least 10 per cent. of total electricity supplies by 2010. I very much support the many initiatives being taken by the Government to increase renewable energy. However, we are starting from a low base and I do not believe that renewable energy alone can fill the gap that will be left by the decommissioning of existing nuclear power stations such as Chapelcross.<br><br>
The gap left by the closure of nuclear power stations will put at risk any chance of realistically securing real and lasting reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Only yesterday, the <i>Financial Times</i> reported my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Construction as having said that, last year, emissions actually rose; the direct opposite of what we are trying to achieve. Professor David King, the Government's chief scientific adviser, commented on the "Today" programme on 7 March:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our dependence on fossil fuels would be unchanged unless there is a new nuclear power build at least to replace existing nuclear power stations."</p></blockquote>
The Government need to think the previously unthinkable and grasp the nettle of new nuclear builds. There have already been some welcome positive first steps; for example, the realisation that "nuclear power, no thanks" is no longer acceptable. In particular, the PIU report concluded that the nuclear option should remain open. That alone is not enough. I know that Governments do not build nuclear power stations, but they can create the environment that will allow them to be built. More detailed and urgent action is therefore required from the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Tynan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that a decision to build or rebuild nuclear power stations must be taken as a matter of urgency if we are not going to find ourselves in a position in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
which we will be dependent on gas and other sources of energy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. There is a definite case for that and we need to make progress now. We need to have the debate; that is why it is important that we have discussed the matter recently and are doing so now. We need to have many more debates on it.<br><br>
It is unfortunate that my neighbour, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) has left, because I now come to a point that has been made locally. At the beginning of last week, he visited the site along with the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), a local Tory councillor and a Tory list Member of the Scottish Parliament. My thought when they suddenly appeared on the scene was, "Oh how the vultures gather when life is ebbing away".<br><br>
Following that visit, the list Member of the Scottish Parliament—no doubt with on eye on the forthcoming election—proclaimed that he was confident that the Chapelcross site would win the argument on the location of any new or replacement nuclear build. The statement contradicted both the submission to the PIU energy review by Conservative MSPs and the comments by the hon. Member for Beckenham in the debate on 5 March, to which I referred earlier. Both argued that Hunterston and Torness, not Chapelcross, should be the preferred locations for any new nuclear builds in Scotland.<br><br>
Whatever the Conservative party's position, the reality is that BNFL, the owners of Chapelcross, has stated that it will not build any new power stations. On Monday, I met a representative of British Energy, who made it clear that, given that British Energy has its own sites, Chapelcross does not figure in the company's plans for any new nuclear builds.<br><br>
A campaign is up and running, led by the unions on the site. The work force are more interested in other issues and in finding out what their future holds in the next two or three years; especially where they fit into the Liabilities Management Agency. That is an important aspect with regard to people's terms, conditions and pensions. However, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary should know that if the campaign for "Chapelcross Two" is likely to be fruitless, the work force have the right to know. Supportive as I am of the nuclear industry and the need for new nuclear builds, I am not prepared to sit back and allow the Chapelcross work force to be used as no more than lobby fodder for nuclear reactors to be built elsewhere.<br><br>
The recent announcement of the end of electricity generation at Chapelcross brings home to us all that nuclear power is at a crossroads. More immediately, we face the urgent need to bring alternative high quality employment to replace the jobs that will be lost at Chapelcross. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will outline the action that the UK Government and Scottish Executive will take to achieve that and minimise the impact of the closure of Chapelcross nuclear power station in my constituency.</span></p>

<p>1.17 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Anne McGuire)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) on securing this debate and on making such a powerful speech in support of his constituents and their interests and concerns regarding the impending closure of Chapelcross nuclear power station.<br><br>
The Government are well aware of the significant contribution made by the station to the local community over some 43 years. It supplied electricity to Scotland and the rest of the UK through the Anglo-Scottish electricity interconnector. BNFL undertook a careful analysis and, following an economic review of all its Magnox stations, concluded that Chapelcross is no longer economical in today's market conditions. That is why it has announced that it will accelerate the closure date to March 2005, which is some 3 years earlier than previously thought.<br><br>
That is a commercial decision taken by BNFL in the light of the revised economic assessment and, in particular, falling electricity prices. Those recent falls have benefited industry and consumers nationwide, but there is also less need for the other products from Chapelcross. Decisions about the station's future are a matter for BNFL. The Magnox stations are old and a phased closure programme has long been envisaged. Chapelcross is being closed earlier than previously planned because it is no longer economical in today's market conditions.<br><br>
It is for the market, not Government, to decide if and by what means the generating capacity of Chapelcross should be replaced. Like my hon. Friend, I regret job losses, but I understand from BNFL that there will be significant job opportunities for some time to come. Approximately half the existing work force of 430 people will be required for defuelling, which can take from three to five years after closure, and thereafter there will be opportunities during the decommissioning process.<br><br>
Staff will ultimately have to leave the Chapelcross site, but BNFL will work with trade unions and staff to prepare people to move into other jobs. The company hopes that a significant proportion of staff who wish to stay with the company can do so. BNFL is also working with the unions to introduce a lifetime partnership agreement, which appears to offer all that can be done to ensure fair treatment and support staff who leave. The agreement includes retraining and reskilling for those people leaving the company.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is concerned about the effects of the accelerated closure on the local economy and has amply demonstrated that in his comments today. I have discussed the matter with colleagues in the Scottish Executive and can advise that, in the event of redundancies, support will be provided through the Dumfries and Galloway local response team in conjunction with the Executive's partnership action for continuing employment framework. That should ensure a rapid response from local agencies in respect of advice, support and guidance on the range of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
retraining, upskilling and employment opportunities. I also look forward to the DTZ Pied report, which will be of value to all concerned in the local community.<br><br>
My hon. Friend raised the issue of building a new nuclear station on the Chapelcross site, saying that the skills base would otherwise be lost. He will be aware that the Government are consulting on energy policy options, including keeping the nuclear option open. This consultation also addresses the difficult issues surrounding security of supply and the future gas imports. A White Paper outlining the Government's conclusion will be published around the turn of the year. The performance and innovation unit report, which preceded this consultation, argued that the nuclear option should be kept open. The Government are not prepared to pre-judge the results of the consultation. I can assure my hon. Friend that Professor David King will be included in the whole energy policy process.<br><br>
Only last week I opened a workshop in Glasgow organised by my Department in conjunction with the DTI and the Institute of Energy, as a part of the energy White Paper consultation process aimed at key stakeholders. Representatives from across the whole spectrum of energy supply, demand and the environment were present. The nuclear companies, BNFL and British Energy, were well represented and able to put their case forward. Their views will be fed into the consultation process and some of them will chime with those of my hon. Friends the Members for Dumfries and for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan).<br><br>
At the end of the day, any decisions on introducing proposals for new nuclear build lie with the private sector and the type of station will be a decision for the operator. Hon. Members will be aware that power station consents matters are devolved to the Scottish Executive.<br><br>
Skills will be needed in the future, not only for new nuclear build, but for safe and efficient management of existing liabilities lasting many decades. It is also an important topic specifically covered within the current consultation on energy policy. At local level, the work force are indeed highly skilled and will be an asset to any future employer.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned the important role that Chapelcross plays in supporting security of supply and grid stability in the region. Indeed, that was central to the case made by the Scotland Office in support of Chapelcross back in January, when access to the interconnector was discussed. Grid support is a matter for Scottish Power, which plans to reinforce supplies to south-west Scotland by 2005.<br><br>
The Government are getting to grips with the nuclear legacy and it is important to proceed with openness and transparency to build public confidence.<br><br>
Last week the Government published their White Paper "Managing the Nuclear Legacy—A Strategy for Action", which set out a detailed plan for radical changes to the current arrangements for cleaning up the nuclear legacy. It will include the creation of a new national body, the liabilities management authority, with a specific remit to clean up that legacy. The cleanup will be consistent with safety and security and will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
respect the environment, while providing best value for money. It will be important to make the best use of available skills.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with all my hon. Friend's concerns. There are clear opportunities for all concerned to feed their views on new nuclear build into the energy consultation, which is open until 13 September. The Government are considering the whole picture of energy policy and, as I have said, propose to issue a White Paper around the turn of the year.<br><br>
In response to various recent reports from the PIU, the royal commission on environmental pollution, the Department of Trade and Industry and the House of Lords Select Committees, we initiated the consultation to allow us to make an informed policy response across a range of areas, including the nuclear issue.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
Last week's White Paper sets out our approach to managing the nuclear legacy and describes the new arrangements that will operate in practice. Most importantly, it makes it clear that the Government's priority is to ensure that the clean-up is carried out safely, securely, cost-effectively and in ways that protect the environment.<br><br>
To conclude this short response to my hon. Friend's Adjournment debate, I hope that the BNFL management, trade unions and staff work together effectively and are successful in reducing the uncertainty facing staff in his constituency. I also hope that they can maximise the opportunities for the staff who wish to stay with the company, and for those who decide to leave.</span></p>
