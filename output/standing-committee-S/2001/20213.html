	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first item of business is a statement on the future of energy in Scotland. Hon. Members will be aware that there is no time limit on the statement and subsequent questions, but in deciding when to bring questioning to a close I shall have regard to the fact that the ensuing debate on Scottish energy in the 21st century must end at 1 o'clock. I will also have in mind that the subjects are similar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make a statement to the Committee. There is a great deal in my portfolio of energy industry construction and the environment that is of current and immediate relevance in Scotland. This is a useful opportunity to bring hon. Members up to date on the issues and to answer some questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Publication of the energy review is imminent, which constrains what I can say about some of the topics that fall within its orbit. However, the starting point for Scotland, as for the United Kingdom as a whole, is that we currently have a healthy energy mix, and it must be our objective to maintain such a balance on which both security of supply and our environmental commitments depend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are doing more than at any time in the past to support renewable energy technologies; I have been an advocate of generation sources such as wind and wave for the past 25 years and it is a privilege to be in a position to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our world leadership in wind power technology was thrown away in the early 1980s because there was no government support for the creation of a domestic market. The Danes have been the beneficiaries and they now have a £4 billion a year, worldwide manufacturing industry. That success can serve as a model and as a warning that we must not allow the same thing to happen with those technologies in which we still hold a world lead. That is why I attach such a sense of urgency to wave power development, for example. The only commercial wave power plant in the world is on Islay; we should manufacture more of those plants, get them into position along our coastline and sell them world wide. That is why I am anxious to give early encouragement to the proposals from Wavegen and Scottish and Southern to establish a cluster of those units in the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to move on to researching and developing offshore wave, the next generation of technology, and we are doing so, but if we are to have the manufacturing benefits and turn it from an
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
aspiration into an industry, we must also start to put projects in place and make these long-talked-of schemes a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot stress strongly enough the link between power generation and manufacturing industry. Hydropower has existed for a long time, although sadly there is not as much in Scotland as there could and should be; an unholy alliance of landowners and environmentalists has prevented anything from happening for the past 40 years. I hope that that will soon change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already, the Government and the Scottish Executive have ensured the well-being of the existing hydro industry far into the new century by bring hydro refurbishment within the ambit of the renewables obligation. In employment terms, the main beneficiaries of that action will not be where the hydro power stations are located but in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil (Mr. O'Neill), where two engineering companies are largely dependent on engineering for hydro schemes. That is the kind of link that I want to identify and expand throughout the renewable technologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am today laying the renewables obligation before Parliament. It offers a fantastic opportunity to develop a thriving industry, building on traditional Scottish expertise in offshore technologies and engineering know-how. There is no point in generating electricity from any source if there is nowhere to send it; that is a problem for those areas that are richest in renewables potential and for Scotland as a whole. Our capacity to be exporters of power is constrained by the inadequacy of the existing infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognised that issue when I commissioned a feasibility study into the concept of a sub-sea interconnector along the western seaboard of the United Kingdom from Lewis—where there are such exciting plans for renewable energy generation—to south-west England. The report is available and will be published today. It is an excellent piece of work that will greatly assist in informing the debate. It sustains the validity of the sub-sea concept while being realistic about the costs and the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also considers land-based options for strengthening the transmission capacity from north to south, alongside offshore ones. The optimum solution may lie in some hybrid of the two. The report was always intended as a preliminary feasibility study, and we are moving quickly to a comprehensive study on options for the development of one transmission system in Scotland and two such systems in the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe. We will do that in partnership with Scottish companies, the Scottish Executive, the National Grid Company, and the regulator. I expect conclusions and firms recommendations on the way forward to be available in six months. Whatever we do will extend to the north and west of Scotland, including the islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Events are moving quickly in the energy world. Since I initiated the sub-sea cable study, another factor has emerged to give fresh urgency to the issue. With my full support and that of the Scottish Executive, the regulatory body—the Office of Gas and Electricity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
Markets—initiated a consultation on the creation of a market in electricity throughout Great Britain; BETTA, the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements, instead of NETA, new electricity trading arrangements, if one prefers the jargon. If the benefits of the proposed arrangements are to be maximised for Scotland, the capacity to sell to the UK market must be increased. That points again to the enhancement of transmission capacity, without which we will not be able to come close to realising the enormous potential for expanding our renewable industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Real successes are being achieved in our offshore oil and gas industry, much of which flow from the excellent work done by PILOT, the body that brings together Government and industry to agree strategies for our offshore industries. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was the previous chairman, and I am the current one. My objective for PILOT, and for the work in my Department that flows from it, is to get the right licences into the right hands at the right time. That is the way to increase the number of new developments and to extend the life of the UK continental shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent developments include the activation of Clare after more than 20 years, the scale of the Buzzard discovery and the use of new technologies by two small independent companies to reactivate the Argyll field. Those exciting projects point in the right direction. I will make an announcement this afternoon on onshore developments and the 10th onshore licensing round. Although I cannot pre-empt the details of that announcement, three of the licences are for areas in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also having success with another stated objective that the Scottish Executive and I share. We are keeping as much of the decommissioning work at Dounreay in the regional economy. When I decided to end reprocessing at Dounreay and open up a new period of stability and certainty there, I made it clear that that should mean not only long-term jobs at the site, but a huge range of opportunities for companies in the area. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority made it clear in its announcement yesterday that that is being delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have touched on only a few aspects of the wide and topical range of energy issues, and I will be pleased to answer hon. Members' questions. There is a lot of meat in my statement, and I will be pleased to flesh out the details. I am also happy to answer any questions on any other aspects of my portfolio.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his statement, which, as he said, is timely. I am slightly disappointed that the energy review will be published tomorrow or Friday, just as the House goes into recess. It is unfortunate that we will not be able to debate the issue as quickly as we might. I appreciate that that may not be in the Minister's control, which is unfortunate in view of the importance of what will be said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I welcome the Minister's involvement with new initiatives over recent months. Can he provide a time scale for those developments—upgrading the infrastructure, for example? People will not invest without infrastructure. Will he comment on the concerns expressed by the fuel poverty lobby about the arrival of BETTA and the removal of price controls? The argument is that energy prices should fall, which helps the fuel poor, but concern remains that the choices are not as wide in Scotland as in England and that the timing should be simultaneous, rather than having one before the other. The Minister should be aware that NETA has caused considerable problems for the combined heat and power industry. Can he give an assurance that it will not have similar repercussions when it is applied in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The renewables obligation is also welcome. Will the Minister undertake to keep it under constant review? Many people believe that Scotland can achieve far higher than the 18 per cent. target; perhaps even double it over a 20-year period. The renewables obligation must be kept under review in the light of capacity. I would greatly welcome the Minister's reassurance on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal briefly with all the questions. On timing, a conspiracy theory is always round the corner, but introducing a document on Thursday when we are coming back next Wednesday does not seem like an attempt to bury it indefinitely—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Sorry, I mean the following Wednesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a demonstration of my ministerial work load; I am back next Wednesday. I take the point. It is a weighty document and it will take time for interested parties to examine it. It is important to place it in the public arena. The energy review is a report to the Government, rather than a product of the Government. It will initiate a much wider and better-informed debate, which will be taken up in the House in the coming months. Because of major changes in the energy markets, a consensus has arisen on the need for an energy review. A day or two here or there is not the real issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the time scale for upgrading the infrastructure. The answer can only be "as quickly as possible." It is not entirely in the hands of the Government to determine, but the priority is to maintain the momentum that has been established by the renewables drive, especially by the proposal for a large wind farm in Lewis from AM EC and British Energy. The project is not feasible without the physical means to link it to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further imperatives are provided by the prospect of a British market in electricity and the understandable desire of the three Scottish companies to be part of a bigger market. They want the benefits of competition; the ability to sell to the whole of the UK. As the market in Europe increasingly liberalises, they may benefit further. I had a productive meeting with the three companies last week. Everyone wants to move forward quickly, to decide on the preferred options—cabling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
and strengthening existing transmission systems, for example—to estimate costing and to examine the best means of payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On fuel poverty and the effects of NETA, the hon. Member for Gordon correctly recognises that NETA has forced prices down. It has some drawbacks in that context that have to be addressed. He mentioned the effects on combined heat and power. NETA has not been going for long and has brought about a reduction of roughly 25 per cent. in the wholesale price of electricity. On the whole, it is beneficial in terms of the price of energy. There are specific issues such as the lifting of caps on prepayment meters. I am still having discussions with the regulator about that and hopefully we will get a synthesis of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the renewables obligation, I have no difficulty with raising targets as high as anyone wants to raise them. There is not much point in setting targets unless we also will ourselves the means to achieve them. There is only one reason why there are higher targets now in Scotland than in the rest of the UK and it has nothing to do with what this or previous Governments did. It is because, 50 years ago, people had the vision to create the hydroelectric industry in Scotland. We owe our 18 per cent. target more to Tom Johnston than to any politician since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot rest on our laurels, saying that Scotland has the higher figure or the higher target. It is what we do now that really matters in changing things. I still detect a big gap between rhetoric and reality. We are all in favour in principle of renewable energy projects, but they all run into opposition, usually from those same people who would say that in principle they are in favour of renewable energy. There has to be some squaring of conscience with intellect and we have to get more of these projects going ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. While I am sure that such comprehensive answers are appreciated, shorter answers would allow more questions to be asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum MacDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's announcement that the further study into the transmission network will look at overland as well as the sub-sea cable. Will he confirm that the Yorkshire interconnector, which is an important part of the Scottish-English route that is due to be completed later this year, was first the subject of planning applications as far back as 1990. It has taken 12 years to be developed to the stage where it is to be completed. Does he agree that although the overland alternatives are more cost effective, there are also big planning uncertainties? Does he agree that the sensible thing is to try to develop both the overland and sub-sea cable together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Planning must be taken into account in the study. For the reasons that I have just given, there is a high degree of urgency about this; not just in terms of renewables, but of British market arrangements. There is a significant difference between creating new infrastructure, with the inevitable planning difficulties, and the strengthening of existing infrastructure, which is what the companies are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Weir 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say about wave and tidal energy, and I agree with much of it. What is lacking is time scale. When does he expect those projects to be up and running and producing energy? As he is well aware, most of the nuclear stations are coming to the end of their lifetime, so options have to be up and running in the near future. Will he tell us how much Government spending is likely to be put into wave and tidal energy following recommendation 16 of the Select Committee report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On wave and tidal energy, we have just announced support for a couple of projects with a strong Scottish bias. I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Those are major options and far too little has been done on them in the past. For as long as I have been around, people have been talking about Salter's ducks. But there are no ducks in the sea, generating energy. One problem is that there is a high concentration on research and development, but there has been less of a translation into production. That is why, working with the companies in recent weeks, I have managed to preempt that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, it is fine for Wavegen to move on to research and development work on offshore wave power. That is excellent and should go ahead. My Department has put £1.7 million into the project, and the testing will go ahead off Orkney. All of that is fine, but a plant is already working and generating electricity on Islay. I have been to see it, and I do not think that even the most obsessive objector could find anything to complain about it; though I would never count on that. As far as I am concerned, we could have scores of those plants around the Scottish coastline to the immense benefit of the communities and our energy needs. There is also a big international market for that kind of generation, so let us get on with manufacturing them. I assure the Committee that if work keeps moving at the present rate, it will not be long before we get production moving and some facilities installed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall sum for wave and tidal power, £260 million is available in capital grants for renewables generally. To a large extent, that will depend on the projects that come to us. We are meeting the demand on wave and tidal at the moment; if there are more demands on that substantial pot, I will be pleased to hear about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's statement. What prospects does he see for the oil and gas fabrication industry in Scotland? He will be well aware of my constituency interest, as we have lost more than 3,000 jobs in the industry. Does he see any prospect of the BP Clare field platform being built in Scotland, particularly at Nigg?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, there has been a bleak period for the fabrication industry. The number of job losses in his constituency peaked at 3,000. Many of the jobs would have gone in the normal course as the work trailed off, but the good news is that there is a big order to chase. Even only a few months
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
ago, that did not seem likely, so we must ensure that UK companies have full competitive rights in the market. At the end of the day, however, it is a very competitive market and, whatever the Government do, it is for the company to judge where it will place orders. We cannot direct BP and tell it to go to this or that yard. What we can do is ensure that the yards have every opportunity to be competitive and to state their case. We must work with them to maximise the opportunity for the contract to stay in the UK, delivering as many jobs as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks ago in Aberdeen, I brought together all the companies that could bid for Clare; not only for the major contracts, but for all the others that will be available. I hope that that will have sharpened those companies' minds and pens and that a lot of work will stay in the UK and Scotland in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly paid attention to the failure in the 1980s to develop the ancillary side to wind power generation and, in particular, to the failure to develop UK companies with turbine manufacturing capabilities. The Danish have taken the initiative. How do he and his Department of Trade and Industry colleagues believe we can reverse that trend? What specific initiatives will he introduce to see that Scotland gets the wind power generation industry it deserves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to dwell on history. I want to go forward and make up the lost ground. There will be a big market in Scotland and the rest of the UK for wind turbine technology, as there will be for all of the technologies. The central question now is whether it can become a fantastic opportunity for our manufacturing industries or another devise for sucking in imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making some progress on wind power. I welcomed and co-operated closely in the decision of Highlands and Islands Enterprise to give what is a record level of support to Vestas development at Machrihanish. I pay tribute to Argyll and the Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Office, which were all involved in a decision that will create a Scottish turbine windmill building industry. In that context, I particularly welcome the decision to offer subsidy for the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry, because it doubles the market at which Vestas can aim. I can vouch for the fact that it was always part of the encouragement to Vestas to say that we would move heaven and earth to get that ferry in place. That has been done, and I pay tribute to my colleagues in the Scotland Office.

Vestas is in place, and there is every prospect of an industry developing in Lewis, particularly off the back of the British Energy-AMEC proposal. There have been other expressions of interest, and others will appear. The opportunity is there, and we must work to maximise the UK and, specifically, Scottish content in

We have talked about the 21st century, but not one mention has been made about the future of the coal industry. I know about the tremendous amount of work that has been done by the Department in supporting the coal industry. Having talked about wave and wind power and about renewables—as well as the comments made on the vision shown on hydroelectricity—we are in a good position to take them forward. We require that mix and we should work towards self-sufficiency. We should not be caught out, as we were in 1974, by external factors, and coal must play a part in achieving that aim. Will the Minister expand on his discussions with my hon.

It is true that I did not mention coal—he will be relieved to note that I did not mention nuclear power either—but we can remedy that. As he rightly recognises, an enormous amount has been done to maintain a deep-mined coal industry in Scotland. There is a medium-term future for coal, but whether there is a long-term future depends the coal industry's ability to adopt cleaner technologies. As I am sure that he and everyone in the industry recognises, the future must be in clean coal technology. If that can be introduced, coal can continue to play an important part in the mix. For this Government, everything in our bones tells us to do what we can to support the mining industry, and that is exactly how we have behaved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Will the Minister tell us whether the comprehensive study that he is now commissioning into the interconnector cable will include links to the northern isles, or will it just cover the west coast? He will be aware of a wind farm that is operated in my constituency by Shetland Aerogenerators, which has expressed to me an interest in expanding.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point.

I do not think that it is a problem that the energy review is to be published during the week's recess, as it will give everyone time to read it. The report by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry points to a continuing differential between the cost of nuclear power generation and other available forms of generation. Does the Minister accept that view and, if so, what subsidy would be required per nuclear station if the Government were to decide to restart the nuclear programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were a couple of misconceptions in the hon. Gentleman's comments. It will not be the Government who decide to restart the nuclear programme. The decision on whether to build new nuclear power stations or apply for permission to build them will come from the companies, and it will be a commercial decision. It is worth noting that there has never been a nuclear moratorium in this country. For commercial reasons, the companies simply have not come forward for a long time with proposals to build. They will formulate their own views from what flows from the energy review on whether it is economically attractive to seek the investment to build new stations or to make proposals. There will be inquiries, and things will take their course in the nuclear industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is mistaken that the Government will build nuclear power stations or provide the trigger for power stations to be built. We will create a climate in which decisions will be taken. Part of that climate will involve consideration of what we did without nuclear power stations. In Scotland, 50 per cent. of the population depend on nuclear energy. In the United Kingdom, 25 per cent. of the population depend on it for their electricity. Those decisions will be taken while we also have serious obligations to meet our Kyoto commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, his statement that we must be realistic about the costs and difficulties was rather ominous and is not positive. As we all know, the cost of developing wave and tidal power involves not only the cost of the wave and tidal power generation stations. In remote areas, such as the Western Isles and the Inner Hebrides, costs are incurred connecting the power generator to the grid. Developers will not invest if they have to pay for the connection costs. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will make a financial commitment towards the cost of the sub-sea connector along the western seaboard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. We are examining that now. When the hon. Gentleman reads the report, he will recognise that if we committed ourselves to a full network in which every renewable project, however small or remote, was going to be linked to the national grid, the costs would be phenomenal. I would not give such an open-ended commitment. We want to maximise the potential and the benefits for the renewables industry, and we recognise that that requires a substantial revision of the infrastructure. That is the starting point, and we will see how it unfolds. My objective is to link as many remote energy developments to that grid as is economically possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will agree that the debate is timely, as the energy review is about to be published. The information that emerged recently confirmed that Scotland has enormous potential to make a contribution to the energy that the world needs in the 21st century. I hope that the debate will be a positive attempt to secure consensus among all the parties on what we can do to ensure that Scotland's potential is fully unlocked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us will be aware of the report that Garrad Hassan produced on the potential for renewable energy in Scotland. It concluded that Scotland has a capacity of 59 GW of renewable energy, and pointed out that the United Kingdom's entire generating capacity is 79 GW. In other words, Scotland has the capacity to produce the equivalent of three quarters of the United Kingdom's entire electricity requirement from renewable energy. It is one thing to have the capacity, but another to unlock and deliver it. Many of us recognise that there are some constraints. I should like to explore what they are and what the Government can do to help to remove them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One clear point to emerge from the report is the Ministry of Defence's objection to some of the possible developments. The Ministry has opposed both onshore and offshore wind developments in certain areas. I understand that it particularly wanted to reserve onshore areas in the south-west of Scotland and the highlands. I should like to ask the Secretary of State if she is prepared to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Ministry of Defence reviews its long-term low-flying requirements, although the matter is not urgent. It is a matter of balancing public interest; the Ministry has its requirements, but they should not be absolute when there are real commercial and environmental alternatives. Low flying has to take place, but it must be done in a way that does not inhibit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
development too much. The issue is not a problem right now; we have a long way to go in the unaffected areas before we come up against a bar. However, we need to address the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's announcement about renewables. I accept that our circumstances are due to the commitment to hydro, but there is every reason to accept that, with the potential now identified, an 18 per cent. obligation is very modest for what Scotland can achieve in the next 10 or 20 years. That is why I think that the obligation should be reviewed upwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Savidge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Gentleman's point about making representations to the Ministry of Defence in light of the events of 11 September. Wind power provides excellent security of supply and does not involve the dangers of, in particular, nuclear power. A plane could be flown into a nuclear power station and create a Chernobyl situation, and if nuclear fuel were to be dispersed around the world it could fall into the hands of terrorists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I shall talk about both the commercial aspects and the security risks of the nuclear option later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has rightly referred to the encouraging plans to build the biggest wind farm in the world in Lewis, involving 600 MW of development. That kind of development is the way forward, but we need the infrastructure to connect that capacity to the grid. We must also consider ways to ensure that the community of Lewis benefits from its contribution; the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. MacDonald) may have views about that. Of course, it will benefit from the construction work and rent paid for locating wind turbines, but perhaps we should consider other ways to ensure community benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must welcome the fact that the Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas is investing in Campbeltown, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid). He advises me that the work is well under way and that 150 jobs will be created. However, we must all regret that we have to attract inward investment concerning a technology in which the United Kingdom was at the forefront when it was in its infancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats—I think there is a general consensus on this—favour market-led solutions to the energy problem. However, let us be clear that this is not a free and open market; it is, at best, a managed market, constrained by our international obligations under Kyoto and by imperfect competition. Whether the Government like it or not, the climate, in terms of taxation, regulation and obligation, is critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When wind turbine technology was being developed, the UK was not prepared to provide a home market that we could have developed, which would have allowed us to test that technology, bring it to perfection and become major world exporters. Denmark gave its manufacturers a home market, and the rest is history. That is regrettable. If wind
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
technology is to expand at the rate that many hope it will, it may not be too late for British manufacturers to come into the market. I certainly hope that they will be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly pleased about two developments in renewable technology in my constituency, which are indicative of the progress that is being made. A 21 MW wind farm has been given the full go-ahead at the Glens of Foudland between Inverurie and Huntly on the A96. There was remarkably little opposition to that proposal, although about 18 conditions have been attached to the planning obligation to meet the worries of some local objectors. I had not considered them to be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in severe weather conditions, difficulties could be caused by ice thrown from the turbines. Farmers were worried that that could threaten the livelihood and well-being of their sheep; I presume also that the odd shepherd could be in the wrong place. One of the undertakings is that, in heavy ice conditions, the windmills are stopped. Another is that if they are out of use for six months, they should be removed. That sort of learning curve has proved necessary. Objections can be handled and accommodated, and I hope that most people will regard the feature that is about to appear between Aberdeen and Inverness as an interesting diversion from what is a bleak stretch of road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other development is in Insch. The Scottish Executive have funded a feasibility study into a district heating and electricity scheme, which is, in effect, a combined heat and power system for the village, using waste timber. Insch is in the middle of a timber area; obviously, there is much waste and off-cuts, which have no commercial value and create a disposal problem. Local business people, councillors and the community deserve credit for developing the system. There was much resistance to it in the beginning, but it now has almost total support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People came round to the idea when they were reassured that their worries about traffic and potential pollution could be dealt with, none of which was as serious as they thought. People realised that the system would enable them to participate in new, environmentally friendly technology and—in a small village in rural Aberdeenshire—to make a direct and specific contribution towards a more benign form of electricity generation, contributing to dealing with climate change problems. That should be replicated in communities throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the wave technology in Islay could be extended. We can go from one extreme—a 600 MW wind farm in the Western Isles—to the other, a small district system in Insch or a modest wind farm in rural Aberdeenshire. The great thing about such developments is that they take us away from situations in which we must always think of investment in massive power stations. We shall be less dependent on such large-scale technology systems in the future. The developments to which I have referred come in all shapes and sizes.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
My hon. and noble Friend, if I can call him that, the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) reminded me about the potential for generating electricity from the Pentland firth. The firth is right outside the front window of the offices of Dounreay, where there is a related capability. That is logical now that Dounreay is becoming a centre of expertise in decommissioning rather than reprocessing nuclear waste. There is great merit in such developments. Caithness and elsewhere will welcome engineering capability being applied to a new renewable benign form of technology, which does not have any problems that are associated with handling nuclear material, as my hon. Friend would be the first to admit. Can the Minister explain what is being done to bring forward such technology?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The world summit takes place in Johannesburg in September. The prime objective of the agenda is to examine sustainability, especially among the poorest countries in the world. A specific aim is to provide electricity to 2 billion people who are currently without it. It is clear to anyone that that electricity will come not from nuclear power stations, or even from oil or coal-fired power stations, but from such technologies as photovoltaic power and wind power. If more economic activity occurs for those activities in Scotland, we will have greater opportunities for homegrown exports and overseas aid. We should want to be part of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been estimated that the world market for renewable energy will be £400 billion by 2010. That is a huge slice of business for Scotland to aim at. As we have the best profile for renewable electricity in Europe, we should be in the vanguard to take advantage of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention briefly the nuclear industry, although the Minister's answer to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) reassured me. If the industry must sell its product in a competitive market without subsidy, I am sure that there will be no new nuclear power stations. We must ensure that the playing field is level for all technologies. If that is the case, nuclear power has no economic justification. It is hugely expensive, and it is a cuckoo in the nest because, for many years, it has taken billions of pounds of subsidies that were denied to other technologies. It has not delivered cheap electricity and the problem of dealing with nuclear waste has not been resolved. However, it has inhibited other technologies in reaching economic viability. Wind power has not received anything like the support of nuclear technology, but it is now commercially viable and it does not require subsidies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was rather disingenuous. In the past, huge subsidies have been given to the nuclear industry and, even now, there is a write-off of past liabilities on the nuclear industry's balance sheet. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not taking assurances from previous Energy Ministers on face value. They said that the nuclear industry would have to compete with other forms of electricity generation on a level playing field, but the assurances were never honoured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I are as one on the matter. The scale of the subsidy and the openness of delivering it are such that it will be difficult for the nuclear industry to hide under a manipulated regime, which it has done in the past. It has received £9.5 billion of subsidies over the past 20 years, but the entire renewable sector has received less than £1.2 billion. There can be no justification for such distortion in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, one may argue that nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gas; that is the only argument that the industry has going for it. However, renewable sources do not produce that either, and they are cheaper and require smaller subsidies. The capacity of renewables has been largely untapped, and progress toward renewable sources must be correct. It would be foolish to choke off that avenue because we are subsidising a technology that been has proved not to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in cross-party agreement. We must have a clear and level economic playing field when considering write-offs of past costs. However, we must not ignore future costs, such as decommissioning, storage of waste and eventual disposal of waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Estimates show that we must deal with £50 billion of accumulated costs. We should not add to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point addresses the point made by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan. We are not in a completely free market. The Government set the trading and obligations regimes through the regulator. We must demand that the process is open and transparent. It must be clearly devised to expand renewables rather than nuclear power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate everything that the hon. Gentleman is saying. He said that we must address renewables by unlocking capacity and being able to deliver. However, the delivery of such potential will take considerable time. The Minister for Industry and Energy disclosed that 50 per cent. of energy in Scotland is based on nuclear power. In the light of that, does the hon. Gentleman not see a future for nuclear power generation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do see a future for it, because there are operating nuclear power stations. No one—not even Greenpeace—is calling for them to be shut down immediately, because that would not solve the problem. So long as they are operating safely, they should continue to operate to the end of their useful life. I am concerned that we might have extended the life of some of them further than anybody believes is right—although the lives of none of the Scottish stations have been extended too long, except, perhaps, the one in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, although his assurances about it lead me to accept that it should continue to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nuclear power should wither on the vine. There is no longer any justification for diverting investment into nuclear power technology, because we will have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
ripe harvest to reap, if we are prepared to invest a fraction of the amount that nuclear power has received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that although the new electricity trading arrangements—about to become the British electricity trading and transmission arrangements—have lowered the price of fuel, they have also distorted the market. In England, combined heat and power, which is a very efficient way to use gas, expanded rapidly but has now collapsed. We are still waiting for the Government to say how they will deal with that problem. Unless they swiftly solve it, their targets will not be met. It is estimated that £3 billion of combined heat and power investment has been cancelled because of the collapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland is not as well developed as England with regard to combined heat and power, but the Combined Heat and Power Association, of which I am a vice-president, has suggested that a couple of developments in Scotland would not have happened if the new electricity trading arrangements had been in place. Therefore, we must ensure that the changes are not introduced at a time when they might knock some promising developments on the head. The fuel poverty lobby is of the view that we should not deregulate the gas and electricity markets until the trading arrangements have settled down. I merely ask that that point be taken into account, and responded to constructively because it is a cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a part of the country that has been heavily involved in, and has greatly benefited from, the oil and gas industry. In recent months, there have been several announcements of job reductions—companies rationalising and slimming down, which could give the impression that the industry is in trouble. The reality is that although the United Kingdom's continental shelf is a mature province, it has a long-term future. Its character is changing. It is also expensive and we are discussing a very competitive industry. To maintain our ability to operate profitably, we need a benign licensing and taxation regime. I have occasionally been concerned that the Government have threatened to destabilise that regime, but I also welcome the fact that those of us who made representations to persuade the Government not to do so have been successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the companies that I speak to say that, as long as there is not a major adverse change, they will continue to invest in the North sea. Therefore, the industry continues to offer a real career to young people and it is facing a problem. It needs reskilling—a new generation of skills. I would like to believe that the schools, colleges and universities in Scotland—especially the north-east of Scotland—will make a major contribution to teaching people those new skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some young people are saying that they do not want to join an industry that is shedding jobs. It is important to get across to such people that the industry is changing, but it is not in terminal decline, that it offers many exciting technical challenges and that many innovations and new ideas are being generated in its quest to squeeze out more oil and gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I was a close observer of the development of the oil and gas industry in its infancy. When the first fields were being announced, the projected recovery was entirely based on an assumption that only about 40 per cent. of the oil would be taken out of the reservoir. That seemed scandalous, even at the time. The people who made that assumption said, "That is all we can cope with, because the pressure will drop." Now we are talking about taking out 60 or 70 per cent. of the oil. That requires a variety of ingenious techniques, many of which have been developed by companies in Scotland. I want to put down the marker that, with the right climate, commitment and integration between colleges, universities and the industry, there is a bright future for those who want to make the industry their career. It will employ thousands for many years to come and make a useful and significant contribution to the United Kingdom economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been generous in giving way. Does he also agree that, as the Minister suggested in his statement, the unique cooperation between Government and the industry in PILOT has done a great deal to make it possible to exploit mature and fallow fields?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will go further. I welcome the fact that what I regarded as a precipitative statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he first came to the job has turned into an extremely constructive relationship. When he was in opposition, he took the view that the oil and gas industry would be a useful source of revenue to fund his programmes and he thought that he could squeeze more tax out of it. I give him credit that he listened to the review that he had initiated. The arguments were well put by the industry and a co-operative environment was created—the Secretary of State for Scotland was involved in that. That environment has broadly continued. I find that many of the top managers in the industry are reasonably appreciative of their relationship with Government and their ability to have access and input in a constructive way, so the co-operation is beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat view is that Scotland has a huge potential to unlock a green technology that is right for the 21st century and offers a massive spin-off in terms of jobs, investment, exports and overseas aid opportunities. We are looking for a Government-inspired initiative to unlock that potential and enable the people of Scotland to do what they ought to be able to do—be world leaders in benign renewable technology. We have the capacity and we ask the Government to help us unlock it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall be brief, as Back Benchers from all parties wish to contribute—I have been warned by the Whip to ensure that there is plenty of opportunity for them. I should point out that my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire) is not sweetened in her attitude by the fact that it is her 30th wedding anniversary. [HON.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested that the hon. Member for Gordon concentrated on renewables. He developed the theme that the Government need to create space for renewables in the marketplace. That is what lay behind the Utilities Act 2000, which introduced the renewables obligation, obliging electricity suppliers to ensure that a proportion of their electricity came from green sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument has always been that we must move renewables from the fringes of electricity supply to the main stream. That is what the renewables obligation is about. Renewable energy accounts for 10 per cent. in the United Kingdom but 18 per cent. in Scotland, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy pointed out. That is a result of the great vision of people such as Tom Johnston, who saw the opportunities for hydro 15 years ago, which provided a huge spark to that sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The right hon. Lady will be aware that if sub-sea cables are to be used, the question of paying rents to the Crown Estate Commissioners arises.

Will she give the necessary instructions to the commissioners to ensure that we avoid the nonsense of Government moneys being invested to lay the cables only to have it coming out and going into the Treasury coffers at the same time via the Crown Estate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. It is the subject of continuing work, so I cannot provide a definitive answer at this stage. I will, however, take up some of the arguments about renewables mentioned by the hon. Member for Gordon, although I do not want to upstage my hon. Friend the Minister of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key responsibilities of an Energy Minister—I speak with some regret that I cannot pontificate longer on this subject, because I was previously the Minister for Energy and I find the subject fascinating—is to keep the lights on. It is a simple issue. Maintaining the security of supply requires diversity of supply. The hon. Member for Gordon and I are of a similar vintage: we remember
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the 1970s, when the energy balance was out of kilter. The six-day war had disturbed the balance of energy supply; we never want to return to that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon mentioned a study that referred to 59 GW of renewable energy capacity in Scotland. As he said, capacity alone does not necessarily make it viable to generate such an amount. Storage of renewable energy is important. Security of supply is bound up with the ability to store renewable energy, particularly for wind farms. I had the privilege of opening the world's biggest offshore wind farm at Blyth in Northumberland. With impeccable timing, I did so on a day with no wind, which rather overshadowed the official opening. Someone produced a model that could be blown on to show what a wind farm would look like in action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fuel cells are also important in this regard. During the previous Administration in the United States, some interesting work was done to examine small-scale wind farm development. They are called "farms" because the wind is a crop and a resource. Work in California linked wind turbines with fuel cells, which dealt effectively with storage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to mention Ministry of Defence objections to wind farming and other energy developments. I have spoken to colleagues at the Ministry of Defence about that matter and my hon. Friend the Minister of State is meeting Ross Finnie some time next month to discuss the issues further. Defence Ministers have genuine anxieties, as the hon. Member for Gordon recognised, but we want to ensure that those do not impede the expansion of renewable energy sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to market-led solutions, the operation of the electricity market in the UK was badly skewed prior to our election, which is why we introduced the new electricity trading arrangements. As the Minister of State pointed out, it is important to move on in relation to BETTA and to integrate Scottish energy into the electricity trading arrangements. Our future competitiveness as a country will depend on the availability of low-cost energy. The European Union remains way out of kilter with the United States on energy prices. As constituency Members of Parliament our instinct is necessarily directed towards domestic consumers—the people who elect us—but we must acknowledge that lowering electricity prices is also crucial for the commercial energy sector and our international competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are amused because I am learning French, but one reason for doing so is that it will enable me to argue with the French Government about energy liberalisation. Unless the French liberalise their energy markets, they will keep European energy prices unsustainably high and damage the operation of our markets. I hope that everyone who attends the Scotland-France rugby match will take the opportunity to mention that to French supporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon talked about combined heat and power, which the Government are very keen on. We were aware that problems would emerge with the development of NETA, and we are anxious to find solutions. I was an Energy Minister, so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I know of the hon. Gentleman's interest in CHP and there are some positive developments. We retain the commitment to our target of installing 10,000 MW of CHP by 2010. My colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will shortly publish a consultation document on a draft strategy for CHP. There have been some recent successes: Conoco announced that it will go ahead with the CHP plant at South Killingholme and last April the Government announced a £50 million boost for CHP at community level. I am interested in the development at Insch, especially the use of biomass or timber waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the nuclear industry and I repeat what my hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy said about the Government's commitment to a free market: it will be up to the nuclear generators to make proposals. At present, proposals for nuclear generation are prohibitively expensive. However, I note from the 	<i>Financial Times</i> that in Finland, because of the concern about a reduction in the availability of biomass, the Government are considering further nuclear generation, which was considered and rejected 10 years ago. As an example of joined-up government in respect of renewables, my colleagues in agriculture are anxious to support biomass crops; it is an area of renewable energy that may boost rural economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has several peculiar and distinctive characteristics relating to energy: it has coal, gas and nuclear generation and, I hope, it will have a substantial increase in renewable generation over and above hydro. It is a good test bed for new technologies and some excellent work is being done in the universities on renewable energy. Heriot-Watt and Glasgow universities have excellent projects on renewables that receive research council funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (David Hamilton) referred to the coal industry. We must never forget that Scotland has the last deep-mined coal. As it is a fossil fuel, the secret of the future success of the coal industry will be clean-coal technology and we should not underestimate its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the opportunity that the debate provides and I hope that it will not be the last of its kind. The distinctive nature of the Scottish energy market means that there is a role for all Scottish Members of Parliament in debating the performance and innovation unit report, although it will not be produced very quickly as the subject is not easy to turn around. We are looking at the first 50 years of a century and the future prospects for industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon has long experience of the oil and gas industry and recognises its importance to the Scottish economy. However, sometimes we forget that it is a global industry too. A key development in PILOT was the recognition of our international expertise in mature, difficult-to-access fields, which we can market very effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I visit places such as China and Malaysia, I meet Scottish oil and gas workers for the big companies and those in the supply chain who show
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
that the standard of technology available from Scotland is second to none. We have a great opportunity to market that asset and to cope with the third age of development in the UK continental shelf by globalising much more. I pay tribute to those in the oil and gas industry who have recognised that fact, but it will involve skills. We suffered when the oil price went down to $10 a barrel, because many young people started to regard the industry as insecure. It is not. Our future depends on high-quality engineering skills. We have the capacity in Scotland and we must do everything possible to ensure that the industry has a sustainable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Weir 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of an energy policy must be to deliver energy at a reasonable cost using secure, diverse and environmentally sustainable sources. The policy must promote economic efficiency, affordable access, environmental sustainability and diversity and security of supply. In Scotland, all that is to some extent in place. Indeed, Scotland is already a net exporter of electricity. We generate on average 26 per cent. more electricity than we need at peak capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have diversity of supply, with ample resources of coal, gas, oil, hydro and, increasingly, wind power. Even excluding nuclear power, we are still well within our operating parameters, with almost twice the generating capacity required at peak demand times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Industry and Energy said earlier that some 50 per cent. of Scotland's energy was nuclear. The latest Library figures suggest that the figure is 44 per cent., but nevertheless that is undoubtedly substantial. He also said that any future nuclear development will depend on the market. I draw hon. Members' attention to the evidence given by British Nuclear Fuels plc to the recent Select Committee on Trade and Industry and the report on that evidence. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What was required was some sort of financial assistance to bridge that gap, preferably one that would provide a subsidy of about 1p per kWh."</p></blockquote>
Nuclear energy is clearly not viable in its own terms. However, Scotland still relies on nuclear power, and it is worth reflecting on how we reached that position. The energy industry in Scotland has always been skewed towards nuclear energy. Previous Governments forced us down the nuclear route, even though it is clear that the cost of generating nuclear power is greater than it is for other forms of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990, the then Government gave financial incentives to English energy boards to construct a new plant in the north-east of England rather than use the gas that came ashore at the terminal in Aberdeenshire. The great gas robbery, as it was known, meant that Scotland was denied the right to energy generated by that new plant—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It was well known in Scotland. Hon. Members must remember it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish electricity industry was forced to buy power from nuclear stations whose generating costs were much greater. Had that Government invested in the St. Fergus plant, Scotland would have had a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
combination of gas, hydro and coal that would have given us the cheapest energy base in the European Union. Instead they invested, through a guarantee, £170 million in a new gas pipeline in the north-east of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time, many people wondered why the Government chose to meet those costs rather than spend half that amount on strengthening the electricity interconnector, which would have allowed electricity generated in Scotland to be sold for a fair price across the border. From recent revelations, we now know that Enron US gave financial guarantees for the project. We have to wonder how much those guarantees are worth now, and ask how much public money was poured into the project, which subjected Scotland to nuclear options. The Energy Secretary at the time was Lord Wakeham. I understand from the radio this morning that he has now resigned from the board of Enron. I am not sure what there is left to resign from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1980s and 1990s the Tories were accused of going for the dash for gas, although from recent revelations it would appear that the present Government went straight to the dash for cash. Between them the previous Governments have saddled Scotland with the huge advance gas nuclear reactor stations, which generate electricity at an increased price. That is before we got on to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Begg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that in a debate entitled "Scottish energy in the 21st century" the SNP spokesman seems to want to dwell on the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady will bear with me, I want to dwell for a few minutes on how we got to this stage. The Trade and Industry Select Committee report was published last week. Referring to the proposed waste management agency it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It remains to be seen—and will doubtless take some months to become apparent—whether relieving the industry of these liabilities will actually change public perception of the industry and encourage investment in it … It is essential that there be no further delay in government decision-making; the Government should make a clear statement on the future of nuclear energy as quickly as possible."</p></blockquote>
Nuclear is key to the whole issue of how we deal with Scotland's future energy. If the Government go down the route of nuclear energy, follow the PIU report and give that subsidy, it will have an impact on coal. Investment is needed in new clean coal technology if Scotland's coal is to be used for energy in the future. It will also have an impact on the moneys needed for the renewable development. We believe that nuclear energy should have no future in Scotland, and that existing plants should be decommissioned at the end of their economic or technological lifetime. Liberal Democrat Members agree with us on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has the ability to develop its energy needs in a non-nuclear strategy. A good example of that is the combined cycle gas turbine station in Peterhead, which is the most efficient of its kind in Europe. The maximum theoretical efficiency of power stations is rated at 60 per cent. When the two new generators for
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Peterhead go ahead, the station will operate at 57 per cent. efficiency. We must accept that given our commitments to Kyoto we cannot go ahead on coal and gas alone. As the Trade and Industry Committee observed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly, investment in maximising the exploitation of UK reserves will delay the time at which security of supply becomes an issue for this country."</p></blockquote>
In other words, there is a window of opportunity to take the renewable option while we have the supplies of oil and gas to tide us through, rather than rely on nuclear stations. Nuclear stations will be decommissioned if we go to plan within the next 10 years or so. If we do not get the renewable sources of wave, wind and water up and running, generating electricity very quickly, there could be a shortfall. We must recognise that and not bury our heads in the sand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member mentioned the window of opportunity. It has been there for the past two or three decades. Regrettably we have not exploited it as we should have done. When the crunch time comes, there may be a shortfall if we have not invested in renewables as he and others in this Room, including myself, would like us to do. What happens if we cannot achieve the security of energy supply that we are talking about? Would he agree that there is the potential to consider replacement rebuild of nuclear reactors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not. I was making the point that we can get over that with our existing supplies of coal and gas if we maximise them properly. Nuclear power has no future, and there is a danger that if we do not maximise the potential for other energy use while renewables come on stream, we will be forced down the nuclear route again. That would be disastrous for the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may find that some Labour Members agree with his views on nuclear power, although I do not know how many. The hon. Gentleman is looking to a control market. Will he say how he would deal with a control market in Scotland, which is a British market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our option is clear: we have been looking for independence, but that does not come into it. The energy market has never been a free market in the UK or in Scotland. It does not matter which route the Government choose, or what the Minister says about it being up to the free market energy generators to decide whether to produce renewable or nuclear energy. Both types of energy will have to be subsidised in some way, so the market will never be a free one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would choose the renewable option, as that is the obvious way to proceed. When we evaluate energy resources, we should consider whether it is technically possible, economically viable, and can produce sufficient energy. Wind power is fast becoming established, and annual growth in the renewable energy sector is estimated to be approximately 40 per cent. Unfortunately, Government action seems to suffer from poverty of ambition. The renewable energy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
target for 2010 for Scotland is 18 per cent., which is almost double that of England. Much of that is to do with the existing hydro schemes in Scotland. However, the European average is 22.1 per cent. In Austria, the target is a massive 78.1 per cent. In Sweden, it is 60 per cent., and even in Portugal, it is 45.6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland should be able to use its massive natural resources to increase substantially the amount of energy that comes from renewable resources. That must be done quickly. We do not have time to sit around talking intellectually about the best direction to take. When I put the timescale for wave and tidal power to the Minister for Industry and Energy, he made the right noises about getting it up and running as soon as possible. However, we need massive investment as soon as possible, otherwise wave and tidal power will go the same way as wind power. That substantial additional investment is essential to take the route into new technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made of Denmark, which created 15,000 jobs from wind power from a standing start. There was no background in aviation or other industries, from which wind technology sprang. Scotland, however, has a huge background in shipbuilding and offshore exploration, the very industry that will give the lead in wave and tidal power. Many of the technological problems of wave and tidal power have been overcome. As the Minister said, some existing schemes are working, such as the one on Islay. The particular problems with Scottish waters are also surmountable. There was an interesting debate in Westminster Hall about that in the last Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear whether the systems can produce enough energy and are economically viable. The Minister rightly said that we need to get the systems up and running. However, as has been said, we need to do that quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's correct concern about the urgency of getting the systems up and running, can he explain why local SNP activists object to wind farm applications in Ayrshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone can object to any sort of scheme. I ask the Minister how many objections he would find to a nuclear power station. The number would be rather more than wind power prompted. The point has already been made about the difference in what we believe and the reality, and that we must square the circle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK nuclear industry already received substantial funding from the Government. In 1999, it received some £26 million for research and development, and there was the recent takeover of Magnox liabilities of £3.7 billion. Greenpeace has said that the UK electricity consumers have paid £2.6 billion via the non-fossil fuel levy. The Minister spoke
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
earlier about the investment in renewables and quoted a figure of £260 million for all renewable sources. Given the figures for the nuclear industry, is that enough to push forward a renewable energy system that will give us sufficient energy to close the gap and replace nuclear power?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I refer to the recent Science and Technology Committee report on tidal and wave power, and specifically recommendation 16, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current level of public spending on wave and tidal energy research is insufficient to give the technology the impetus it needs to develop fully."</p></blockquote>
Therein lies the rub. Such energy is still only potential and theoretical, and until we invest money in the technology, it will not be realised. The only route through which sufficient investment will come is the Government. As has been mentioned, that is important because of not the potential not only for energy, but export of the systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the PIU report and its comments on the future of energy resources. However, I have not been encouraged by leaks, which have suggested for example that the nuclear industry will be exempted from the climate change levy and that change will be made in planning regulations to allow a shorter period for obtaining planning consent. That is despite the fact that planning consent is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and not this place. Greenpeace have claimed to have obtained details that say around a dozen new nuclear plants could be built with the help of Government tax breaks and a more relaxed planning regime. We do not know whether they are true yet, and we look forward to receiving the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) mentioned the report commissioned for the Scottish Executive, which has shown that it is abundantly clear that Scotland has the resources to provide all our energy needs from renewable resources. In his intervention during the Minister's statement, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the problem of infrastructure. That is a serious problem that will need serious investment, and I do not think that he really got an answer to his question about where that investment would come from and the time scale in which it would be put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate on wave and tidal power, it was pointed out that the national grid in Scotland is on the wrong side of the country for wave, wind and tidal power. Many of the potential sites for such generation are in the north and west while much of the grid is in east and central Scotland. Investment will be needed to expand that grid, and we should not shy away from that, because the original grid was built with public money and Governments have invested heavily in other energy projects. Dounreay is a perfect example, as is the great gas robbery to which the Minister took such exception. Mention has been made of planning application. Again, any development may have some objections to it, and that is something that will have to be overcome. I reiterate that that has nothing to what nuclear stations have, but it might lead to some delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will come as no surprise to Members that the Scottish National party is resolutely opposed to nuclear power. As we have said before, existing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
stations should be decommissioned at the end of their technological lifespan and no new stations built. Many nuclear stations in Scotland are to be decommissioned within the near future—the next 20 years. Even allowing for the lifespan and the expansion of some stations, we still have insufficient energy resources to replace them. I have already spoken about the window of opportunity, but the targets for 2010 will not fill the gap. We must increase them. I shall not refer again to Government investment as I have mentioned it several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Huge potential exists for investment in renewable technology by existing industries, especially in Scotland. The shipbuilding industry could construct the machines and the oil industry could diversify into wave and tidal power, particularly in the north and east of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government Members have largely rejected public investment, but the enormous potential export market for wave and tidal energy devices easily justifies the public investment necessary to ensure success and would aid the security of supply about which the Government are so concerned. Frankly, it is too important to be left to the vagaries of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>12.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Begg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating the Liberal Democrats on securing the debate, but before I am accused of being too lovey-dovey with them, let me say that they probably got the idea from me, as I secured an Adjournment debate last October on the future of Scottish energy. I had only a half-hour debate then and I began by listing all the sectors of energy production—coal, nuclear and others—that I would not have time to mention. I concentrated on the oil and gas industry. I am pleased that the other sectors have been mentioned in today's debate. We need a vision of the future for energy in Scotland for the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned that many Members of Parliament naturally focused on consumers in an attempt to appeal to our constituents, but many of my constituents are also involved in the production of energy, particularly upstream. I make no apology for concentrating predominantly on the oil and gas industry. As the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said, and as statistics demonstrate, the future for oil and gas is healthy. About 264,000 jobs in the UK were supported by the offshore oil and gas industry in 2001. As the Secretary of State said, other jobs are connected with global export projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Aberdeen, several indigenous companies have become global companies operating in a global market. Such companies often started off in fishing or logistics, but are now working throughout the world,
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
bringing many economic benefits back to the UK, to Scotland and to Aberdeen. The industry supports employment that constitutes about 6 per cent. of the total work force in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is also important in UK terms. It is interesting to observe how the Scottish National party always views it as a Scottish industry, when it is a global industry that operates within the UK. About 200 constituencies throughout the UK support 50 or more oil-related jobs, so the industry is important to the economy of the UK as well as of Scotland. The industry is, as the hon. Member for Gordon said, mature. We are still a long way from the twilight; perhaps mature middle age is a better analogy. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is no way that I could be referring to myself. It would be an extremely young middle age in my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many new developments have been announced since October, which was the last time that I was lucky enough to debate the issue. The total industry expenditure for 2001 is expected to be close to £8 billion. Development expenditure in 2002 is expected to total some £3.5 billion. That is an increase of more than 25 per cent. on the previous year. Those statistics do not suggest that the industry is ailing or in decline. During 2001, 20 new field development projects were announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy alluded to some of the exciting developments made in the past two months. The discovery of the Buzzard field, one of the largest discoveries for a decade, was made at a time when people thought that there were no large fields yet to be discovered on the UK continental shelf. They were proved wrong. There is a great deal of oil yet to be discovered. Perhaps the most important developments have been those made in the recovery of oil previously thought to be unrecoverable. The hon. Member for Gordon alluded to the fact that, once upon a time, only 40 per cent. of oil could be recovered. Nowadays, we recover 60 to 70 per cent. of new oil reserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most exciting announcements, which was noticed in the energy and business press but not elsewhere, was the reissuing of licences for developments that had previously been thought redundant. I must pay tribute to the Department for Trade and Industry. When the small companies Acorn and Tuscan Energy first embarked on persuading the DTI that it should reissue the licences, many in the industry thought that they were mad, and thought that the DTI would never allow that to go ahead. However, the companies were tenacious in persuading the DTI that they had a good business case, and the DTI relented. The Argyll field licence has been reissued, and the development of that field will begin in the next 18 months or so. That is important for the future of the North sea; they are not big operators, but tiny companies that have seen a market opportunity and have, by working with the Government, developed their businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must pay tribute to the success of PILOT, the joint industry and Government body. There is no doubt that PILOT is a model for other industrial sectors. It has been suggested that transport might benefit from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
something similar, but I do not know whether it can. PILOT has bought great benefits to my constituents, and it shows that the Government and industry working in partnership can bring about development and look to the future. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only have redundant licences been reissued, but the 20th round has been announced. This morning, licences were also announced for some onshore developments. There is a long future for the oil industry. I concur with the hon. Member for Gordon, who mentioned predictions. Far too many people talk the oil industry down. I am glad to say that the Liberal Democrats are not involved in that, but some of the other Opposition parties do it. We are talking about our future. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Before Opposition Members start saying, "It's not us", I must say that as soon as any job losses are announced, some hon. Members are immediately quoted in the local press as saying, "This is the end," and "This is a folly."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loss of a job is dreadful for any person. What is happening in the gas and oil industries will ensure that those people get new jobs as quickly as they can. That has certainly been the case in the past 18 months; there were difficulties when the oil price was $10 a barrel but it has improved greatly with employment opportunities in the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a problem in respect of fabrication, both in the hon. Lady's part of the north of Scotland and in mine.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members that interventions should be addressed to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) for his intervention. He obviously read my speech in my Adjournment debate, when I stressed the importance of getting involved in offshore wind projects and the development of turbines. I have often told my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) how important they will be for the companies involved and for the development of fabrication yards throughout Scotland and the north of England. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman supports the oil and gas industry, as it is important for hon. Members from the north-east to talk it up. Skill shortages are a problem in the North sea oil and gas industry because many people, especially those who work offshore, are in their late 40s
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
and early 50s—mature middle age, perhaps—and will soon be retiring from jobs that are often physically demanding. They may have moved to work in the oil and gas industry from shipyards and other sites in the industrial heartland of Scotland when those industries were in decline. The oil and gas companies complain about skill shortages and young people may want to go into the industry when they leave school because it has a future. It is not a dirty industry; the work is something that they can look forward to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made the case for the oil and gas industry and it was important to do so. However, we must look further into the future to the development of sustainable and renewable energy. We must consider life beyond hydrocarbons, as they will not go on for ever; they will not be the fuel and energy source of the late 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's statement; he has a west coast bias and he is keen on developments there, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles, who I hope will have a chance to speak in the debate. I have an east coast perspective; there is a role for Aberdeen, especially in intellectual developments. As the Secretary of State said, the knowledge that already exists in north-east Scotland for developing marginal fields in difficult circumstances is the sort of knowledge that can easily be used to steal a march on the Danes, who already have the advantage in the development of wind power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great future for oil and gas, but it is important, too, to address the development of renewables. It is a matter of diversifying the north-east's economy from one type of energy—oil and gas—to others, such as offshore and onshore wind, wave power and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I reiterate what I have said before and will say again; what I want for Aberdeen in the future is that it should be regarded not only as the oil capital of Europe, but as the energy capital of Europe. That is the future of Aberdeen, and of an important energy supply in the 21st century for Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Carmichael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep my remarks brief to allow other hon. Members to contribute to the debate. I have referred to the need for a strong infrastructure for the development of renewable energy in communities such as mine, and to the potential for a lack of joined-up government in respect of the Crown Estate Commissioners. I shall not revisit such matters, but I hope that they will be taken seriously and given particular attention by the Scotland Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall follow the example set by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) and draw the Committee's attention to the offshore oil and gas industry and the fact that it has benefited the communities in Orkney and Shetland. Recently, I had the privilege of attending a small ceremony at the Flotta oil terminal to mark the 25th anniversary of its inauguration. When the terminal was inaugurated in 1976, people felt that, come 2000 or thereabouts, they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
would be considering a decommissioning ceremony. In fact, a few weeks ago, the story in Flotta was different, as it is now in Sullom Voe in Shetland. We have a reinvigorated oil and gas industry; it is an expanding sector with an expanding impact on the local economy. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South that much of the credit for that should go to the PILOT project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be said that the offshore oil and gas industry in the isles has remarkably not had an environmental impact. When it was first discussed, many people thought that a dirty monster was about to be foisted on them. In fact, there have been only two spills in Shetland since the oil industry has been in operation. Neither of them was related to Shetland involvement; both were tanker spills, the most notable of which was the Braer. Credit should be given to the oil industry for the way in which it has conducted its business in the northern isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bring to the Committee's attention an outstanding opportunity that exists at present. It is the development of the industry to the west of Scotland, into the Faroese sector, and offers particular opportunities for the communities in the northern isles. The oil could go elsewhere; it does not necessarily have to come into either Sullom Voe or Flotta, although that it less likely. I urge the Secretary of State to encourage the moves that are being taken by different bodies, principally the Shetland Islands council and the Shetland Islands council charitable trust, to foster better links between Scotland and the Faroe islands. When the Secretary of State has mastered French, she may find time to learn some Danish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have met the Faroese and Old Norse is closer to the language that they speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The islands are still governed by the Danish Government, so I should imagine that the right hon. Lady talked to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also enormous spin-off potentials for communities in the northern isles. We already have a direct sea link by virtue of the Smyril line that comes into Lerwick and the Faroes. Indeed, there are moves in Shetland to permit Atlantic Airways, which now operates a direct service between the Faroes and London, to use a Shetland stopover. That is a good example of the benefit that an expanded Faroese sector, using Shetland, would give to the communities that I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that the oil industry was global and that it exported our expertise. That point was made to me repeatedly last year at the Offshore Europe exhibition in Aberdeen. I remind the Secretary of State that owing to the nature of the industry, we will be among the first to gain expertise in the decommissioning of installations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, we thought that that would be the future potential for work from the offshore oil industry. It does not have the immediate potential that we envisaged, but it has medium and long-term potential. There is much decommissioning work to be secured, and Shetland would be ideally placed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
tender for that. If we can secure the small amount of work that is currently available, there is potential for us to present ourselves as market leaders when big money may be made from decommissioning. I ask the Secretary of State and the Minister to bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mohammad Sarwar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate energy in Scotland. Hon. Members have concentrated on diverse key policy aspects. I draw the attention of the Secretary of State and the Minister of State to renewable energy. That area requires considerable co-operation between United Kingdom Ministers and Scottish Ministers. Our approach should be built on the real partnership between the Parliaments. We must work together to support safe new ways of supplying energy, sustaining our environment and reducing carbon emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain is committed to renewable energy targets, and Scotland's rich renewable resources will go a long way toward achieving those. Thirteen per cent. of Scottish electricity will come from renewable energy by next year, and the target is to reach 18 per cent. by the end of the decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The study on renewable resources that was conducted by the Scottish Executive demonstrates Scotland's huge potential. The United Kingdom's installed generation capacity is 80 GW. The study shows that by 2010, as much as 60 GW of new renewable energy capacity could be available in Scotland and offshore Scotland. That would cost less than 7p per unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Onshore wind is clearly the most economic resource, and could provide 11.5 GW of energy at less than 3p per unit. Scotland's targets for renewable energy could be met almost wholly by onshore wind, but we must go further in leading the United Kingdom on the promotion of renewables, which will mean substantial connection to the electricity network. More than 1.5 billion W of capacity could be connected if the grid were upgraded in north, west and south-west Scotland. However, such improvements would cost as much £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State has consistently maintained a keen local interest in planned interconnectors across his constituency, as have other hon. Members. The Northern Ireland interconnector and the Anglo-Scottish interconnector are planned to be operational next year. We must consider seriously export by wire of renewable electricity in future years, although I recognise that that would involve considerable investment in infrastructure. I urge the Secretary of State and the Minister to give the matter active consideration in discussions with the industry and their colleagues. This demonstrates the crucial importance of research and development in renewable energy. Scotland's great potential will be delivered only if we are also at the cutting edge of advances in the field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's strong continuing commitment to research and development. In three years, over £55 million will go specifically to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Department of Trade and Industry's new and renewable energy programme. In total, £260 million is allocated to encourage the take-up of renewable technologies. Research councils are funding excellent projects throughout Scotland. Guidelines are being developed at Glasgow university for prudent and secure maintenance of offshore wind farms. A team at Heriott-Watt university is considering the possibility of producing solar cells on textiles. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council funds £3 million of energy-related research in Scotland. Funding of £35 million is provided across the UK. That means that universities in Scotland get their fair share of research grants, but we must ask for significantly more in the future. Scotland must lead the United Kingdom in research and development on renewable energy. I urge the Government to accept their responsibilities and to face these challenges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that time is running out and that many hon. Members wish to contribute, but I want to make a few points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the debate secured by the Liberal Democrats, especially as it is taking place prior to the publication of the performance and innovation unit's report. Scotland faces an energy review and power stations such as Peterhead, Cockenzie, Hunterston, Longannet and Torness are due to be decommissioned during the next 30 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) and I share an interest in the Chapelcross situation; that power station faces an immediate problem with regard to the connection to the English market, and the regulator has made proposals that put it in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a cross-party consensus about the need for renewable energy, but one word has been missing from the debate; balance. The contribution of the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) was unrealistic. He suggested that Scotland would be able to produce sufficient energy for the next 30 to 40 years without needing to replace some of the nuclear power stations that are due to be decommissioned over the next 20 years. However, his party are vociferously opposing wind and wave developments the length and breadth of south-west Scotland, as the Minister for Industry and Energy said. I have a particular interest in the wind development scheme at Windy Standard; people in that area are signing petitions that are as long as my arm in objection to that scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that people should not be allowed to express an opinion on such matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has teed the ball up nicely for me, and I will happily smack it down the fairway. I am delighted that people put their objections to such proposals on the record; that is the purpose of the planning process. However, it is two-faced of his party to suggest that 60 or 70 per cent. of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Scotland's energy can be contributed by wind and wave power in the foreseeable future when, on the ground, it is opposing such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Minister of State will shortly meet with the Ministry of Defence. He can expect a long and strong letter from me prior to that meeting, because the Ministry of Defence is putting a brake on the development of wind power in Scotland by suggesting that the construction of wind farms will make it unsustainable to train pilots in low flying. It is incongruous to claim that pilots whom we are sending to the Balkans and other parts of the world cannot be asked to contemplate an environment that includes wind farms. That obscure argument is causing great problems for the development of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Secretary of State are aware of the innovative development of natural power at Dairy in my constituency. That project lays to rest the spurious argument that wind power developments cannot create jobs. They can create quality employment, as they have done in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem in the regulation of infrastructure investment in Scotland, especially in relation to how we deliver quality power supply to remote communities and in relation to wind or wave power generated in those areas. Put bluntly, power systems are trying to invest in south-west Scotland but are being prevented from doing so by the regulator, who believes that there is no demand for increased reliability of power services to that area. It is a flaw in the regulation of the system that it cannot permit investment that would change lives in south-west Scotland. I ask those with some influence in the matter to refer the agencies involved to public demand in south-west Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Energy resource for the next 30 or 40 years—the next generation—will require balance. Time is short. I have not yet reached mature middle age, to use the term used by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg). By the time I do so, we shall have had to make some significant decisions about energy policy that will not involve ruling out nuclear power for the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum MacDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate on the west coast sub-sea cable, which has already been mentioned and which is so important to my constituency. The first context that is relevant to the project is the potential for developing renewable energy in the north and west of Scotland; not only the Western Isles, but Orkney and Shetland and the west coast of Scotland. Hon. Members have already said that Scotland has the best renewable energy potential in Europe; the north and west of Scotland have the best renewable energy in Scotland. I illustrate that with one telling fact. AMEC, the company that is planning to develop the 600 MW wind farm in my constituency, told me that because of the constancy of wind, which colleagues who have visited my constituency will have noticed, and its strength, developing wind turbines in places such as the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
or the far west coast is twice as cost effective as planting wind turbines anywhere else in Scotland or the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is enormous potential for renewable and cost-effective energy in the north and on the west coast. The problem is getting it to the markets that need it. The traditional problem in the highlands and islands is how to access the markets that need such energy. The big markets are in the south of England. Scotland and the north of England do not have enough demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second context is that, if we do not develop the transmission network and infrastructure to take our renewable energy down to those big markets, other parts of the UK and, indeed, Europe, will supply that market. Most Members will be aware of the interconnector that runs from France to England, carrying about 2,000 MW of power. No doubt as the English market develops, that capacity will be built on, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members may not be aware that National Grid is working on plans to run a sub-sea cable from Norway to England with Statnett, the Norwegian transmission company. It will cover some 400 miles, cost some £500 million to accomplish and take three years to lay the cable. It is a major engineering project. By 2005, hydropower will run from Norway to the markets of the south of England. That is not all. The National Grid Company is planning to run a sub-sea 1,000 MW cable to carry power from Holland to the south of England, too. There will be a Norwegian sub-sea cable to accompany the French sub-sea cable and probably a Dutch sub-sea cable, too. There is no reason why we in Scotland cannot accomplish what the Norwegians and Dutch are planning and supply our energy to the south of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are looking at the overland routes of getting power from Scotland to the south of England. The Minister for Industry and Energy said that it is hoped that the planning delays that have afflicted the Anglo-Scottish interconnector in the past will not be as prolonged. However, uncertainty still exists. We must bear in mind that the Yorkshire interconnector has so far taken 12 years and two planning inquiries but, hopefully, it will be in place at the end of the year. There must be some doubt about the developing the overland network. I am not saying that we should not encourage it, but we should not do so at the expense of looking realistically at the potential of the sub-sea cable on the west coast. I hope that the Government will be pushing that. If we are to generate capacity of 5 GW to 7 GW of renewable energy and carry it down to England in the future, there will be plenty of space for scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate on a couple of points. I wish to congratulate the Liberal Democrats on their initiative in securing the debate. I want to highlight oil and gas fabrication, which, in some ways, is the Cinderella of the industry. As I said earlier to my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Friend the Energy Minister, there has been some reduction in jobs in my constituency, but the United Kingdom as a whole has lost more than 20,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have touched on the importance of renewable energy today. It has a great future. As we all know, one of the first acts of Tom Johnston, the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1945 under the Labour Government, was to nationalise hydropower. In fact, he became the chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. We have a strong track record in renewable energy. However, I would like to see the creation of a contingency fund that the local authority standing committee on fabrication has promoted for the construction and fabrication industries. That would diversify that important industry. That is not only wishful thinking; in north-east England, for example, BP, Shell and Exxon put together resources and created alternatives so that new jobs could be created. That is important for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see a great future for renewable energy in the construction industry. We still have about 4 billion barrels of oil to be taken from the United Kingdom continental shelf. The oil is in difficult areas and geologically challenging, but it can come to this area. The BP Clare platforms will be a great boost to the constituency of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Thurso). Scotland has a great track record for engineering, welding and construction. The future is bright for energy, including renewable energy, but let us not forget the important industry of construction and fabrication that is vital not only for the highlands, but throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, I should like to thank all hon. Members who have taken part in this debate. In setting the agenda for today's debate we wanted to look at the wider picture and to draw attention to the potential that exists for Scotland. There has been a wide measure of cross-party accord. So often in politics we are obliged to view matters in the short term, such as problems that our constituents need dealt with immediately, and we do not often get a chance to look beyond the horizon of the next election to two or three elections down the track. We intended to have a debate that took a wide-ranging approach, and we have not been disappointed by the many contributions that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two key principles of energy policy, whether for the United Kingdom or Scotland. First, and I deliberately put this at the head of the queue, whatever we do must be environmentally sustainable. As my teenage children grow up, find partners and have children, those grandchildren that I may one day have will live in the world that we leave them. Whether we leave them a world that is sustainable will depend on many of the actions that we take today. It is incumbent on all of us as members of the human race to ensure that we get that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second key principle is the one to which the Secretary of State referred: we need to keep the lights on. We must provide for our energy needs. We are an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
energy-rich, energy-consuming nation like the rest of the western industrialised world. The question is not simply how we generate electricity and create all our energy, but how we use it. We need to become wiser about that. We should consider not just how we conserve energy by such measures as combined heat and power, but how we run our factories and build our homes. All those areas must be taken into account. I congratulate colleagues in the Scottish Executive who are taking measures to ensure that those initiatives take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to cherry pick, if I may, one or two of the points that have been raised in the debate. Before I do that, I should like to mention an issue that was raised about BETTA, NETA and the costs of energy. I visited the citizens advice bureau in Wick a couple of weeks ago and heard of some of the problems that the staff have been dealing with. Many pensioners are receiving different offers from the various energy companies, and are finding it extremely difficult. Sometimes they are transferred to another company and do not realise it. The CAB has a substantial work load on that problem, as I am sure have those in other constituencies. Could I, in passing, ask the Minister and the Secretary of State to talk to their colleagues about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not forget the amount of fuel poverty that there is in Scotland. Delivering sustainable and affordable energy is an important part of what we seek to achieve. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon said in his introductory remarks, we see a tremendous potential in renewable energy, particularly for Scotland. A number of members made the point that Scotland is well placed, not only to generate for its own use, but to export. The wonderful thing for those of us in the far north and the outflung islands is that the further away one gets, the more efficient it is. That bodes well for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pick up on one point that a number of hon. Members made about low-flying training areas. If memory serves me, LFTA4 covers 80 per cent. of the landmass north of the Great Glen. One of my constituents is extremely keen to put in a wind farm, but it is inside that area. The Ministry of Defence has turned down his application categorically. When questioned about this, the MOD says that it will look at every application on merit, with the result that the answer is no every time. Therefore, as the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale pointed out, our pilots may one day have to fly over other countries that have health farms. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> What did I say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Health farms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh well. It is a lovely thought—our pilots in health farms. I meant to say wind farms. Our pilots may have to fly over countries where there are wind farms. It should not be beyond our wit to allow some wind farms to be placed in the training area. We must seek a balance. It would be wrong to place wind farms in certain areas of the country, such as those of
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
outstanding natural beauty. However, it would be acceptable to set aside some land for renewable energy in much of the far north and the islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was raised about the foresight of having hydropower in Scotland. One of the benefits that Scotland does not enjoy arises from the Treasury's choice of the climate levy tax over a carbon-based tax. Scotland would benefit from a carbon-based tax, as hydro-electricity would not be subject to it. Perhaps the Secretary of State will bear that in mind when she speaks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members raised the issue of transmission. A key point about renewable energy is that it is difficult to store. We will have to think outside the box, as we do not have the technology that can help, although there are developments in fuel cells. One of my constituents—Mr. Mackay—has written to me for some months about the possibility of using renewables to generate compressed air, which can be stored and used to drive the generators when required. I am no engineer, as I have already displayed, and I have no idea whether that would work. However, the DTI and ETSU programme should consider such initiatives. If we are to succeed and realise our potential, we will need to consider methods that do not seem too promising at the moment, but that could be the technology of the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A member of the Committee—it may have been the Minister—rightly said that we need to get away from simply research and development and get into production. As in the PC industry, if we wait for the best thing to come along, we will wait for ever, as developments are taking place all the time. We must make a purchase at some point. In the renewable energy industry, we must start to transmit commercially. We will learn a great deal about production, and we will have research and development through that commercial use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has immense potential in several areas. Dounreay is a world-leading centre of excellence in decommissioning skills, and the task is to capture its value in the local economy and to export those skills while still being based in the area. As hon. Members pointed out, there is tremendous potential for the offshore oil and gas industry and for renewable energy. Scotland has huge potential not only to export energy, but to lead technology, and to create jobs and a lasting benefit from being a world player on this stage. I hope that the Government will listen to the points made by hon. Members from all parties, and that they will help to facilitate Scotland's role in leading the world in the development and use of this technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to ask a serious question. Ofgas imposes higher landing charges at St. Fergus than it does at Teesside, where the charges are higher than at Bacton because of the formula. It has nothing to do with transmission but with higher charges. I understand that Ofgem is considering the same model, which will be biased against electricity generation in the north of England and certainly in Scotland.

As the Secretary of State and the Minister said earlier, the PIU report is a report to Government, which will be published tomorrow. I caution people not to believe that it is Government policy; we will have to consider its recommendations. It will start a debate on the issue and set out the facts, options and scenarios. It will also remind us of the Kyoto target; little has been said today about carbon emissions and global warming, yet the Government must take account of those important requirements, just as it is our remit to take account of the security and diversity of our supply of energy.

My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South is right about the potential of the continental shelf, which is greater than we originally thought. The investment last year was £3 billion and will be even greater in 2001. The Clare, Argyll and Buzzard fields were mentioned earlier; there are many more reserves than we thought there would be, and there are more to come. We commended the PILOT initiative, started by my right hon. Friend and continued by my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend earlier raised the matter of new, fuel cell technology, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Gordon. We must look beyond the next few years, or even decades, when considering how to store energy more efficiently and effectively. The Government are supporting research into fuel cells and will shortly issue a consultation on the future powering of vehicles, as transport uses 25 per cent. of energy supplies.

Members on both sides of the Committee have rightly concentrated on the importance of renewables. I share their enthusiasm and have done for some time. I can tell the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) that I tried to persuade previous Governments to be enthusiastic about renewables, and I agree that there is a great potential for Scotland to benefit from them. I visited the Wavegen machine in Islay, which is great, and the Scottish Power wind turbine site at Harlock Hill in my constituency—I give 100 per cent. support to all wind power applications in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the PIU report is published tomorrow, those who argued today for increases in the target for renewables will not be disappointed. I hope that I do not get into trouble for having released that information in advance. However, I caution hon. Members to be aware that there are significant unresolved issues. The electricity grid is the weakest, whereas the potential for renewables is the greatest. We have heard about planning constraints and problems of low flying, but not about the problems at Prestwick airport—particularly the radar—that is affected by wind farms. It is a genuine problem that, like the others, must be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital investment is also necessary. I would like briefly to mention, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Angus, the extent of Department of Trade and Industry investment in renewables—£55.5 million for research and development, for example. In March 2001, the Prime Minister announced an additional £100 million to support renewable energy technology, which has had a huge impact. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, from being on the margins and fringes, renewables are now moving into the mainstream of our electricity supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross is right about energy efficiency. When he reads the PIU report tomorrow, he will find a strong emphasis on the importance of energy efficiency and of taking account of demand. He spoke about mis-selling by electricity companies, and I have received complaints about that myself. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Department will investigate further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that and having declared myself a strong enthusiast for renewables, I want to inject just one cautionary note. My right hon. Friend mentioned it and the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross picked up on it. The Government's job is to ensure that the lights stay on, that the television still works and that transport still runs. We will not be popular if the lights go off because our constituents do not have enough electricity to meet their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a long-term nuclear sceptic. I took part in the Malwarcher march in the 1970s and I managed to have Chapeldonan removed as a potential nuclear power station site, so I have a long history of involvement in the movement. However, we need to keep the option of new or replacement nuclear power open. If other sources cannot meet the demand, nuclear power may need to be considered further. I say
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
that with some reluctance and disappointment, but it is vital to recognise our responsibility to ensure sufficient electricity supply for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Annabelle Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way so near to the end of his speech. He has just brought up the nuclear issue. We cannot prejudge what will appear in tomorrow's report, but will he confirm that planning consent for new nuclear power stations in Scotland is an entirely devolved matter for the Scottish Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not expecting tomorrow's report to be predictive on new nuclear power. I am saying only that the nuclear option needs to be kept open. I have said previously that the responsibility for agreeing on new power stations is devolved to the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament, but they also have to recognise their joint responsibility with us to ensure that electricity continues to be available for their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate. I wish that I had more time to mention coal, which is important to my constituency and I hope will continue to be important in the future. We have invested £41 million to keep Longannet going, which many hon. Members have welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The astonishing aspect of our debate, as always, is that Scottish National party Members see a panacea for everything. The hon. Member for Angus concluded his over-long contribution by saying that the way to solve all the problems would be an independent Scotland, and he implied that that miracle would solve everything. However, there was no mention of the North sea oil fund that we used to hear about. That is because the SNP now realises that that is totally foolish—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be able to raise a matter of such immense and immediate importance to Kintyre and Moyle, which will be directly affected by the new ferry service. I am sure that the Minister will rightly wish to stress benefits when he replies, but I want to focus on the wider implications of the decision to initiate a ferry service from Campbeltown to Ballycastle, and possible benefits for my own constituency. I shall address the role of the Scotland Office in bringing the service about, and I shall ask specific questions about the status of the project and the next steps to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a brief recap of how we reached the present point for the benefit of the few hon. Members who may not be intimate with every detail of the matter. For a couple of summers between 1997 and
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
1999, a commercial ferry service operated between Campbeltown and Ballycastle. It was the brainchild of the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Forsyth. Alas, it transpired to be a glorious photo opportunity with no substance, no strategy and no future—rather like the noble Lord himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The service was limited to sporadic operations during the summer months, which ensured an unstable and unsustainable impact on both local economies—an aquatic boom and bust. However, far worse was the dogmatic insistence that such a service had to be operated on a strictly commercial basis. Anyone could have predicted that that was completely unsuitable for the route. The service failed and the project languished, as did so many other Tory transport and economic initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the project would still be languishing if it were not for the energetic intervention of Scotland Office Ministers and, especially, the determined engagement of the Minister for Industry and Energy. I hope that the Minister of State will spell out the nature and scope of the collaborative effort to instate a viable and sustainable ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle. I deliberately do not use the word "reinstate" because I hope that the new ferry service will not be a rehash of what failed before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The collaboration is important because, in our post-devolution age, such joint work involving central Government, two devolved Administrations and local councils, communities and businesses could serve as a model for future successful collaborations. I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last month, we heard the welcome announcement that necessary agreements have been reached and the tendering process is well under way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tendering process is not under way. It cannot start until this Parliament transfers powers to the Scottish and Northern Ireland Executives. That is causing the hold up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that the hon. Gentleman does not have a great track record on making predictions. As recently as 8 January, he was predicting that the initiative would flounder in a bureaucratic nightmare. That was less than two weeks before it was announced that it was going to take place, so forgive me if I do not take his objection too seriously. There is market testing. We cannot simply go into a market and announce something without testing it beforehand. There have been expressions of interest—I understand that the Minister will clarify that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be a summer-only service like its predecessor. It will operate for 11 months of the year. The initial term for the contract will be 5 years. The maximum amount of annual subsidy that can be made available for the support of the service will be £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm that the service, once under way, will be allowed the full five years to establish itself and grow as much of a commercial market as it can? Businesses in the west of Scotland
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
and in Northern Ireland—the Minister for Industry and Energy mentioned one such company—will want to take advantage of the service. If we are to avoid a return to the localised boom and bust of the past, businesses must be confident that if they build the use of the ferry into their business plans, it will not be snatched away from under them with insufficient warning, as has happened previously. A lack of medium-term investment in both planning and transport was the plague of the UK economy for far too long. I hope that the Minister can give me an assurance that we have truly learned lessons from the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging that the service will operate for 11 months of the year and will no longer be a summer only operation. Presumably, the off-month will allow for a winter service and refitting of the ferry. Will the Minister give an assurance that, regardless of whether the ferry is based in Scotland or Northern Ireland, the matter of its refit will be open to free and fair competition? If it will, may I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the excellent ferry facilities available at the Garvel dry dock in Greenock? Semple Cochrane plc, the company there, already refit much of the Caledonian MacBrayne fleet, and they send service management teams to oversee refits in other parts of the UK. I am sure that the firm would submit an excellent value-for-money tender if it is a clean and fair competition, as I am sure it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel a press release coming on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can quote the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) on my press release in support of that bid, I will be happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the level of the subsidy, the Minister may be able to correct me but I cannot think of a comparable project that enjoys such generous subsidy. It is important to reject the laissez-faire approach of the Conservatives, but surely it is equally important to be judicious in setting high standards for proof of the economic benefits when deciding whether to give subsidies and at what level such subsidies should be fixed. I know that some have tried to make political capital out of the issue of which budget the subsidy will come from, but surely the important point is that every pound in subsidy is a pound of taxpayers' money and must be spent wisely. I should be grateful to my hon. Friend if he would outline the economic benefits that he believes would justify the generous level of subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way a second time. I must point out that the Scotland Office and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions have refused to pay the subsidy. The subsidy is being paid by the Scottish Executive. The difference is that there are Liberal Democrat Ministers in the Scottish Executive. That shows once again, just as with tuition fees and free personal care for the elderly, that it is Liberal Democrats who make the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to acknowledge that every penny that the Scottish Executive spends comes from the Government. It is because the Labour Government have increased spending in all parts of the UK, especially in Scotland, and because of their sound economic management, that the Scottish Executive have generous amounts of money to spend in the variety of ways that he mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that local economic judgments are matters for the Scottish Executive, but it would be interesting to know if the Scotland Office has made a contribution to the assessment. As the project is going ahead—presumably the answer was positive—is it the Minister's understanding that the value-for-money assessment will continue throughout the first five years of the project? As we move through the five years, I hope that much thought will be given to ways in which other parts of the west of Scotland can exploit the opportunities that the new ferry will bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an ideal world, all ferry services to Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and all points west and south would sail from Greenock and be operated mainly by the Gourock-based Caledonian MacBrayne. I accept that we are a little way off that ideal but, until such a glorious day dawns, there may nevertheless be ways of linking both passenger travel and, perhaps more likely, freight into the Campbeltown ferry from elsewhere. As such, the Minister should consider a successor committee to the ferry action group that played a key role in delivering the project. It could involve businesses and representatives from surrounding areas, promote the benefits that the new ferry will bring and seek ways to extend those benefits to the rest of the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some significant hurdles must still be overcome, the process of securing the ferry is a triumph of the collaborative approach involving the Scotland Office, the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Executive. The collaboration extended across the political divide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, do you agree with your hon. Friend who, on 7 December—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the Minister of State, Scotland Office, who said on 7 December that rather mean Liberal Democrat members of the Executive were hindering progress? Does that analysis still stand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is tempting me to intrude on relations in the Scottish Executive, which are entirely a matter for its various partners. I was hoping that he was about to congratulate the Minister on achieving a result that is of tremendous benefit to the people of Argyll and beyond, and to Northern Ireland. It was sad that rather than doing that, he tried to score a petty political point. It was sad but not atypical of—if not his approach—the approach of his party.

This project was a good collaboration that put the needs of local people and businesses first across the political divide. I applaud the Scotland Office for its pivotal role in that success, and hope that it can be built upon to bring greater benefits to the whole of the west of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns) on securing the debate, on making an excellent speech and on powerfully putting the case for the facilities in his constituency. I hope that that case will be heard by those who will take the matter forward and that it will be taken up seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, huge support has been shown throughout the process from members of communities in Kintyre and beyond in Scotland and Moyle and beyond in Northern Ireland. That support was shown not for the reinstatement of the ferry—because we do not want it as it was previously—but for a properly funded, full-time operation for the route. The Secretary of State and I are proud of the role that the Scotland Office has played. There have been some gibes from the side, and we are hearing them again today, but it is true that—I was going to say that the project would have not got off the ground, but that is perhaps not the best analogy—it would not have set sail had it not been for my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), the current Minister for Industry and Energy. Some people have not been prepared to give him the credit for that, but I am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde alluded to the fact that some people have asked why my right hon. Friend and I—and our predecessors at the Scotland Office—have spent so much time on this matter. The answer to that question is because that ferry service is important. It matters to the people of Kintyre and of Moyle. These are sparsely populated rural areas that are located far off the beaten track. They are among the most deprived areas in the United Kingdom, with high unemployment and static or falling populations. Many hon. Members will recall the impact of the winding down of the Royal Air Force base at Machrihanish as the cold war ended, and the recent closure of the Jaeger factory. Those events were, in part, symptoms of the broader problem of Kintyre's geographical peripherality; a problem that is shared to a lesser extent by Moyle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a website for Kintyre that promotes the attractions of the "Wee Toon"—as it refers to Campbeltown—as the "nearest place to nowhere and the furthest from anywhere." That is how the local people describe their town, but it sums up the problem that Campbeltown faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, despite their relative isolation, both areas have huge tourist potential. The golf course at Machrihanish is one of the hidden gems of Scotland's embarrassment of riches with regard to that sport.
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Moyle contains the Giant's causeway, one of the wonders of the world. Both Moyle and Kintyre offer opportunities to truly appreciate their scenery and tourist attractions, as the Bushmills distillery is located on one side of the Irish sea and the Springbank distillery is located on the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A guaranteed and sustainable ferry service between Ballycastle and Campbeltown has the potential to transform both towns from being perceived as on the road to nowhere to being at the centre of an exciting new tourism and business link between the highlands and islands and Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and I share a constituency interest in crossings between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Will he assure me that similar consideration is being given to the ongoing financial viability of crossings from Stranraer as is being given to the viability of the route under discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware those crossings are currently commercially viable, and they will remain so, judging by the number of buses that pass through my constituency carrying supporters of two well-known Glasgow football teams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is Partick Thistle one of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. However, the operation between Campbeltown and Ballycastle is on a different scale to the service from Stranraer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How did the Scotland Office get involved in the matter? As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde said, my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North, was faced with a difficult situation. Sea Containers, which had run summer-only commercial operations on the route since 1997, were encountering heavy losses. It was becoming clear that the service would not run in summer 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There had been criticism of the way in which the summer-only service had operated. Astonishingly, in one year, there had been a gap in the service in mid-season so that the ferry could take visitors to the Isle of Man for the TT races. That is not a reliable ferry service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that, Ballycastle and Campbeltown had new, publicly funded and excellent port facilities that were in danger of becoming permanently redundant. Several public bodies were asked to assist. However, any effective effort had to involve both Scottish and Northern Irish interests. With the blessing of the Northern Ireland Office and the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Scotland Office was in a uniquely advantageous position to co-ordinate the response. It took in hand the immediate task of trying to get Sea Containers to continue to operate on the route, and if that was not possible, to identify new operators to run commercial services. Many discussions were held through the latter part of 1999 and the first half of 2000 with Sea Containers and other potential operators, but during the discussions it became clear that the service was not commercially viable, and that it could not continue without public subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Throughout the entire process, I have been struck by the fantastic support that the local communities in Northern Ireland and Kintyre have given to the project of getting the service properly up and running. My predecessor capitalised on that by convening an action group in July 2000 to consider the way forward. Membership of that group included local councils in Argyll and Bute in Scotland, and in Moyle in Northern Ireland. It also included the local enterprise company and tourist board. What was most heartening in such a cynical time in politics was that the action group had the active membership and support of local Members of all parties in this House, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The group also included the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we identified that the service could operate only with a public subsidy, the first task was to investigate whether a subsidy could be paid in law. As many hon. Members know, strict European single market legalisation governs the use of public money to subsidise industry, and maritime services are no exception. However, a subsidy may be allowed under certain conditions. If the subsidy is to help provide a lifeline service or to assist economic development in peripheral areas, a member state Government can declare a public service obligation. Again, with the blessing of the relevant Departments, the Scotland Office made direct contact with the European Commission Energy and Transport Directorate-General to ascertain whether a PSO could be declared. That is no easy matter, and it was made more complicated by the fact that there is no formal approval mechanism; just an obligation by the Commission to investigate suspected infringements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following discussions with Commission officials, and with the evidence provided by consultants employed by the action group, the Commission officials agreed informally at the beginning of 2001 that a ferry service would not infringe state aid legislation. The Scotland Office initiated that significant step forward, without which the tendering process could not have started. I confirm that £1 million a year—the final agreed subsidy for the tendering process—will result in the highest per capita support for ferries anywhere in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Executive have made a major commitment. I repeat my tribute to my colleague in the Scottish Executive, Wendy Alexander, for making a bold decision to go ahead with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the question asked by the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson), I mentioned that there was a story that the Liberal Democrats opposed the tender; that was reported, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said. When the Deputy First Minister assured me that Liberal Democrats supported it, I immediately withdrew that allegation. The hon. Gentleman should quote both parts of my comment. There have also been several comments in the press from some quarters about alleged feuds between the Scotland Office and the two Executives,
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
and about one side or the other dragging its feet. As I speak, I am looking at the quarter that made those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Reg Empey is the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and is a great friend of the ferry service. In response to the Government's announcement last month, he said that the proposal was about partnership in action and Governments working together for the benefit of the local economies in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. That was a ringing endorsement from a well-respected politician in Northern Ireland and a man whom I know to be of great integrity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every step that we have taken in this process has been in partnership with the two Executives. I make no bones about the fact that the Scotland Office has pushed the project forward from the start and has continued to do so. However, the goodwill towards the project has always been such that we have often pushed against an open door. Procedural and administrative issues have threatened the project, but the political will has always been there to find a way through, or around, those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on record as saying that a decision to go ahead with the tendering for a new ferry service would be a leap of faith. It is truer to say that the process has been a series of calculated leaps of faith; that a company can be found to make the service successful—we have started on that; that the service will meet the needs of today's tourist and freight markets; and that the public money invested will deliver real benefits to Kintyre and Moyle. There is no totally effective way to test a market without going out and testing it. Last May, the Scotland Office formally sought initial outline expressions of interest in tendering for the ferry service. Shortly afterwards, we also commissioned independent consultants to undertake an in-depth study into the potential benefits and costs of a new service. That work was crucial in identifying the benefits that different service options might bring to the local economies and at what potential cost to the taxpayer. On that basis, we determined that it should run for 11 months a year and for five years initially, and that the subsidy should be £1 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having sat through discussions with consultants, I am confident that the work was thorough. The difficult issue of the potential effects on expansion of the new Vestas wind turbine factory at Machrihanish was also considered. The Scotland Office has nothing to hide and copies of the final report have been placed in the Library. The study shows that a new ferry service is not a guarantee of a substantial improvement for the economies of Kintyre and Moyle. For Kintyre especially, against a backdrop of current difficulties and peripherality, the ferry represents perhaps the best calculated risk to provide the core basis for a stable economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scotland Act reserved responsibility for financial support for shipping services that did not begin and end in Scotland. The primary purpose of a new ferry service has always been to assist economic development rather than to serve merely as a transport link to speed up access between two points. On this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
basis, both the Northern Ireland Executive and the Scottish Executive have from the start undertaken that any eventual subsidy would be found from within devolved sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the request of Scottish Ministers—and with the agreement of her Cabinet colleagues—my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will shortly lay an order in Parliament to executively devolve powers to pay for shipping services between Northern Ireland and the highlands and islands, which is the next step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, the Scottish and Northern Ireland Executives cannot proceed further with the tendering process until the order is made. The Minister said "shortly", but will he give a specific date? It is urgent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said to the First Minister yesterday that, as soon as I hear that he is happy with the Executive order, it would be tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a long and at times tortuous process to get to where we are today. A public commitment from the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Executive to tender for an operator to run a service for 11 months per year over a five-year contract from next spring has been made. I can confirm that that will allow time for the service to develop. I hope that I have given credit where it is due: to counterparts past and present in the two devolved Administrations; to the local authorities and the enterprise company; to other Departments; and to elected representatives of all sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confidently say that the process of achieving the objective for Kintyre and Moyle would not have made such progress without the role of the Scotland Office. At each stage, we played a key role. My hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy provided the initial energy and vision for setting up the action group. I well recall my own first days in this post on picking up the baton at a meeting in Belfast when I had been completely unaware of the issue only a few days earlier. I had moved from Botswana to Ballycastle in one fell swoop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scotland Office maintained progress with discussion on the public service order, with launching the initial stage of tender process and with commissioning research into the costs and benefits of the service. The Scotland Office pressed all those stages forward. I hope that the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Executive can identify an operator for the route—I have noted the suggestions that have been made—and it will go ahead in spring next year. Campbeltown to Ballycastle will have a secure, reliable and properly marketed service on which to build their future economic prosperity; a far cry from when my hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Scotland Office first started this process. I wish all concerned every success.

I shall finish by giving the last word to a Liberal Democrat. Some sour notes have emerged from the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) and his counterpart the MSP for Argyll, who is even more strident and dafter than he is. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I very much welcome your announcement. The new ferry service will be a tremendous boost for the communities in both Kintyre and Antrim. Thank you and your predecessor, Brian Wilson, and your officials for all your hard work. Yours sincerely, Councillor Robin Curry."</p></blockquote>
Thankfully, at least someone in the Liberal Democrat party has some sense. To that I say, "Hear, hear and thank you very much."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
