	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Paul Boateng) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to appear before the Committee this morning to make a statement on the implications of the Budget for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five years ago our first Budget set out our objectives, our plans for reform and the disciplines to achieve economic stability, higher employment and sustained improvement in the level of prosperity, indivisible and enjoyed by all throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In his Budget statement this year, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor was able to report that the United Kingdom has enjoyed the lowest inflation and interest rates for 40 years. For the first time in half a century, unemployment is lower than in America, Japan and Europe. During the year just ended, we had the highest growth rate of any of our major competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, thanks to the successful partnership between the Government and the Scottish Executive, unemployment is the lowest for a generation. Employment is close to historic highs and long-term unemployment is down by 75 per cent. since 1997. Families are benefiting from the working families tax credit and pensioners are benefiting from the minimum income guarantee. Progress is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, when the main economies of the industrialised world had fallen, the United Kingdom entered weaker and suffered longer, unable to act because of higher inflation and borrowing. We have faced the current world downturn with low inflation and sound public finances delivered by our new monetary and fiscal frameworks. This time, the Bank of England has been able to adjust policy at the right time and in the right way. Last year, it cut interest rates seven times. With the support of fiscal policy, we have been able to safeguard both economic stability and growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stability is not an economic abstraction. Households and businesses in all our constituencies have felt the concrete benefits. The latest data shows that Scotland has avoided recession and recent surveys point to increasing optimism in the business community. We should all take pride in that. On the platform of stability, our shared long-term challenge is to build a stronger enterprise culture with balanced growth throughout all regions and countries of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this Budget, we are building on a platform of low taxation and introducing a package of targeted reforms aimed at encouraging innovation, updating the tax system and enabling business throughout the UK to compete in an increasingly dynamic world market. Industries operating in and out of Scotland,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the financial services industry in Edinburgh, the electronics industry and the growth companies in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and film have all entered into our considerations. We have encouraged investment in research and development, which is an investment in all our futures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced a tax credit for larger companies and up to 100 larger companies in Scotland stand to benefit. Many more are already taking advantage of the tax credit for smaller companies. To enable companies to restructure without that essential decision being constrained by the tax system, we have established relief for companies disposing of substantial shareholdings. In the constituencies of hon. Members here today, 340 companies stand to benefit. To encourage businesses to take advantage of opportunities in the knowledge economy, we have introduced tax relief on the cost of intangible assets, including intellectual property and goodwill. Around 2,300 companies in Scotland will benefit from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The North sea oil industry is no stranger to innovation. The Budget sets out important proposals to support its sustainable growth. I know that all hon. Members will welcome that. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I very much sense that welcome from those sitting behind me, although there is a certain churlish scepticism from those on the Benches opposite. Hon. Members present must be used to that, but it is a new experience for me in relation to some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our shared aim must surely be to promote long-term investment in the North sea while giving a fair return to our people. The Budget includes two changes to the tax regime to raise revenues. We are introducing a supplementary charge at the rate of 10 per cent. on North sea profits and, to support new investment, we are establishing 100 per cent. first-year allowances for capital expenditure in the North sea. We are enabling the industry to invest in the long term and to ensure that the whole country feels the benefit of its ongoing success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to our decisions on the Scottish whisky industry. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear".] That at least unites the whole Committee. We have decided to freeze the duty on whisky and other spirits for the fifth successive year. We are determined to support the competitiveness of the Scottish whisky industry. This is the longest period without an increase in spirits duty since the 1950s. Without the freezes, the cost of a bottle of whisky would now be 73p higher. As a result of this Government's actions, it is not. We should get some credit for that from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After close consultation with the industry, we have also decided not to impose tax stamps on bottles of whisky and other spirits. We are genuinely concerned about the damage that such a measure could do to the industry's productivity and competitiveness, impacting adversely on an important section of the Scottish economy. Instead, we have decided that, as well as strengthening our front-line controls at ports and warehouses, we will work with the industry in a joint strategy to tackle fraud.

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
In Scotland, small and medium-sized enterprises account for 57 per cent. of all private sector jobs— more than 1 million jobs in all—and 43 per cent. of total turnover. In 1997, we cut the small companies tax rate from 23p to 21p. In 1998, we cut it again to 20p, with a starting rate of 10p. Now, in 2002, it is going down again—to 19p—with immediate effect. Some 23,000 small businesses in Scotland will benefit from that. We are reducing the starting rate of corporation tax, also with immediate effect, from 10p to zero. That means that companies with profits of up to £10,000 will pay no corporation tax. Some 10,000 enterprises in and around the constituencies of hon. Members present will pay no tax at all on their profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our most disadvantaged areas, enterprise is more, not less, important. We need more businesses in the inner cities and in rural communities, creating jobs, moving money around and engaging in regeneration. In designated enterprise neighbourhoods, our small business tax cuts will be supported with further measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to our proposals on stamp duty. In the pre-Budget report, we abolished stamp duty on home and business property transactions worth up to £150,000. Now, we are seeking state aid approval to abolish the limit altogether for commercial transactions. The stamp duty measures apply to 135 postcode areas in Scotland, identified using the Scottish Executive's index of deprivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Economic growth is not an end in itself. The end must be better public services and a higher standard of life for all our citizens—opportunity for all and no one left behind. This Budget begins and ends with the people, building access and opportunity into the system from cradle to grave. In it we have set out our plans to support parents, as they work to give all children the best possible start in life. The working tax credit will be introduced in April 2003 to help make work pay for those on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are integrating the current system of support and extending assistance to those without children or a disability. A family with one child and one earner working full time on a minimum wage can expect to take home £237 a week. The child tax credit will provide a single, seamless system of income-related support for families. Taken together, the child tax credit and universal child benefit will guarantee support of £26.50 a week for the first child of the 85 per cent. of families with an income below £50,000 a year and £54.25 a week for the first child of families with an income below £13,000. Research by the Scottish Executive based on Treasury models shows that, as a result of the measures announced in the Budget, the poorest 20 per cent. of Scottish households with children will be £630 better off and the poorest 20 per cent. of Scottish single-parent families will be £670 better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Support in childhood and policies that make work pay must be followed by dignity in old age. The Budget also sets out policies that respect retirement and promote pensioner prosperity. Regardless of the rate of inflation, the pension will rise by at least £100 a year every year. This year we are doing even more,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
with an increase of £3 a week for singles and £4.80 for couples. More than 910,000 pensioners in Scotland will benefit. From 2003, 350,000 pensioner households in Scotland stand to gain on average £400 a year from the pensioner credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Targeted support for families, children and pensioners must be reinforced by improved public services. In the Budget for England, we have chosen to increase investment in the NHS. Scotland will receive substantial annual increases in the period 2003–04 to 2007–08, rising from £224 million in 2003–04 to £3.2 billion extra a year in 2007–08. These measures are in addition to those already announced in Budget 2001 and Spending Review 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Budget and Spending Review 2000 settlements for Scotland were based on the Barnett formula, which ensures that increases in devolved Administrations' settlements reflect population shares of comparable spending in England. The formula has produced fair settlements and has allowed the devolved Administrations to determine their spending decisions in accordance with their needs and priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, extra investment comes at a price. The Budget sets out proposals to raise national insurance contributions. Employees and the self-employed will pay an extra 1 per cent. of all their earnings over £89 a week. As employers have a strong interest in better public services—the infrastructure of enterprise—they will make an equivalent additional contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been no broken promises in this Budget. We gave no assurances on the future of national insurance. Indeed, it would have been irresponsible of us to have done so. The increase is the fairest way to fund the increased investment that we all agree is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom will remain a low-tax environment, favourable to business, favourable to enterprise. The overall tax burden is lower than the European Union average and lower than each of our four main EU competitors: the atmosphere is right for economic growth. We have made our choices. We will work together with the Scottish Executive, as we have in the past, to build for the future a stable, productive and equitable society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the vision; that is the goal; that is what we are working to achieve. I commend the Budget to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of all members of the Committee I thank the Financial Secretary for that statement. I also thank him personally for having sent me a copy of it in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economy is clearly one of the most central issues that are reserved. Therefore, it is of particular interest that the Committee should deliberate this first statement following the Budget. There is no doubt that it was a complex Budget: it contained a great deal of detail and many changes, some more expected than others. My one wish for future Budgets is that they might be a little simpler and that the whole tax system might become less complex for our citizens to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
A clear central theme, which has been articulated this morning, was evident, however. Only substantial investment will put our public services right, after 18 years of appalling mismanagement by the Tory party. I welcome the fact that the Government have come to that realisation, albeit a little late in the day. Another key fact that the Budget clearly recognised is that the levels of investment necessary to bring our public services up from the nadir to which they fell a decade ago can be achieved only by raising further funds—in other words, by raising tax. Again, I welcome the fact that the Government, albeit a year after fighting an election on a somewhat different platform, have come to the House and the country, recognising the need for investment and the need to raise taxation to achieve those ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On its own, investment in public services is not a magic wand or a panacea that will automatically put things right. However, it is absolutely clear that it is impossible to achieve the results that I believe all hon. Members want for the public services without sufficient resources and investment. It is reassuring to see what has been achieved in Scotland, where the Executive have been able to put more resources into such things as health spending. There are fewer people on the waiting lists, shorter waiting times and more operations. We have clearly demonstrated that results can be achieved if investment is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed in some aspects of the Budget, not surprisingly. The method chosen to raise the bulk of the funds—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that this is not a debate but a statement. I am sure that there is a question somewhere in his contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Thurso</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. I was about to commence the questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Financial Secretary why the Government chose to avoid a straightforward form of taxation through income tax or progressive taxation through raising national insurance on employees by taking away the upper limit and chose instead a tax on jobs through raising employers' contributions? May I also ask him why, having consulted so widely with the oil and gas industry such a short time ago on many issues, the one area that was not consulted on was included in the Budget? I am sure that that will come up in the debate. How can there be certainty in investment in such a major Scottish industry if taxation is introduced in that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compliment the right hon. Gentleman on the moves on VAT for small businesses. Clearly, that is immensely helpful. However, I wish that he had done something similar for private individuals by raising the tax barrier, which would have given the opportunity to take more people out of taxation. Finally, the Liberal Democrats certainly welcome the broad thrust of the Budget and what has been done. It is better late than never, but would the right hon. Gentleman ensure that the money goes quickly to the services that need it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for the balanced and measured way in which he cast the preamble to his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to that preamble, he will recognise that the whole nation has an interest in public investment. The important thing is to make sure that the investment is accompanied by reform, and to ensure that it takes place within the context of a commitment to continuing growth and creating a climate of enterprise. Therefore, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor had to get the balance right in the decisions that he was called upon to make in the course of casting his Budget. We believe that he did get it right, and I am glad that there is at least a measure of agreement between us on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where we differ on national insurance contributions, I would say that we made a clear commitment not to raise basic or top rates of income tax and we went to the electorate on that basis. We similarly made a clear commitment to public investment. It was our view that the best way of achieving the latter objective in the context of the former commitment was to raise national insurance contributions for employers and employees. We do not regard it as—and it is not—a tax on jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider the budget overall. Other measures promote jobs and make work pay, such as the cuts in corporation tax and the boost for work for the low paid as a result of the working tax credit. It is farcical to think that anything done in relation to national insurance contributions undermines that. Such econometric studies as there are do not indicate that there will be the job losses that the hon. Gentleman's question implied in relation to a rise of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On North sea oil taxation, if the hon. Gentleman considers the basis on which we approached the industry, he will know that our determination has always been to strike the right balance between promoting investment and taking an adequate share of profits from what is a national resource. Many hon. Members from all parties will have laboured on North sea oil taxation during previous Finance Bills. It is always a question of seeking a balance. We must recognise the need to attract new investment, issues of environmental cost and that oil is a national resource from which the people of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are entitled to gain some benefit. I hear mutterings from the Front Bench opposite, but the response of the industry is that that is not likely to impact on investment in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still real profits to be made from investment in North sea oil. When one considers the tax take on North sea oil, Government tax take as a proportion of pre-tax NPV is typically only 35 per cent. in the United Kingdom, rising to 40 per cent. after the proposed changes. Let us compare that to Norway where it is 88 per cent., the US Gulf of Mexico 66 per cent., Canada 70 per cent., Australia 75 per cent., Angola 80 per cent. and Brazil 65 per cent. It really is not on to suggest that any action that we have taken in the Budget undermines North sea oil investment in any way or the profitability and gain to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the all-party committee, which made a forceful and powerful representation on behalf of the industry. I am also grateful to the industry for the care that it took in its submissions to the Treasury, and for the commitment that it has shown to ensuring that we act together against fraud.

Would he describe the Budget as a penny for health and a penny for Britain? If so, he should explain that although we have the greatest health need in Scotland, because of the Barnett convergence, we will receive the smallest increase in health expenditure. If everything is so rosy in the new Labour garden, why must the Scottish Executive up in Edinburgh ask the Minister for everything? Today, we have learnt that the number of Scottish firms going into liquidation has soared by more than 40 per cent.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members should know better than to heckle when an hon. Member is asking a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Pete Wishart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat that because the Minister may want to reply: the number of Scottish firms going into liquidation soared by more than 40 per cent. in the first three months of the year.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland spends more on health than any other constituent part of the United Kingdom as a result of decisions taken by the Executive.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Business liquidations are always a matter of regret. However, it is true to say that Scotland has a remarkable record of business start-ups, which is largely due to the way in which the macro-economic and micro-economic policies of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor have created a climate in which the United Kingdom is good place to do business in, and in which people who have ideas and seek to create new enterprises feel supported. The Scottish Executive and the business community in Scotland have more than risen to the challenge. They are creating new businesses and new jobs, and they deserve congratulations from us all.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I inform the Minister that the Budget was tremendously well received in Scotland? Last Saturday, I was walking down my high street and I was stopped at least a dozen times to be congratulated on the Budget, and on the extra money for health in particular. People see that it is good for employers and good for employees, and if it is good for both, it is good for business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Confederation of British Industry informs us that £10 billion was lost in 1999 as a result of workplace absences, so the more money that goes into health, the healthier the work force. I congratulate the Minister and the Chancellor on the Budget on behalf of my constituents. The whisky industry is delighted with the five-year freeze on duties. Will the Minister engage with us in a long-term strategy on whisky to remove the present discrimination against it over the next 15 or 20 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments on the Budget and its reception in Scotland. We are engaged in a continuing dialogue with the Scottish whisky industry. I cannot anticipate or pre-empt future Budgets, but both the Treasury and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry are committed to ensuring that the Scottish whisky industry retains its international reputation for preeminence in the field of alcoholic beverages. We are always anxious to work with the industry, the Scottish Executive and Ministers from across the Government to secure that reputation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his statement. He was somewhat selective with the statistics that he quoted in his early remarks. Growth in Scottish gross domestic product has not exceeded UK-average growth since the third quarter of 1998. The Scottish economy is falling behind the rest of the UK, not propelling it forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also mentioned business development and drew our attention to small business start-ups. In Scotland, business start-ups have fallen significantly under Labour. In 1997, there were 24,771 new business start-ups; now there are just more than 17,000. Again, the situation is getting worse. He will be aware that the Scottish economy depends on small businesses, particularly those that are unincorporated because more than 70 per cent. of our small firms are not incorporated. Exactly what measures in the Budget are designed specifically to assist that critical sector of the Scottish economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that as the representative of a party that laid waste to the Scottish economy over many years, the hon. Gentleman has a brass neck. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer the question."] I shall. He should recall that employment in Scotland has grown by 80,000 since May 1997. Over the same period, youth unemployment has fallen by three quarters and long-term unemployment has been cut by more than two thirds. Real achievements and real jobs have been created in hon. Members' constituencies. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
something for which the people and businesses in Scotland that created those employment opportunities deserve real credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On growth, the hon. Gentleman should reflect on how the global downturn has affected economies across Europe and further afield. If one compares Scotland with Japan, Scotland's rate of growth stands up to close examination. Not so long ago, suggesting that the Scottish economy would outperform Japan's would have attracted derision. The economic fundamentals in Scotland are sound, the basis for growth is there and economic performance stands up to comparison with similar economies. In the hon. Gentleman's constituency, some 2,910 businesses have been helped by the Government's actions, which were taken forward in the Budget. He should be grateful for that and have the courtesy to come to this Committee and express satisfaction that businesses in his community are benefiting from our actions. That would never have happened had the party of which he is a member been in power today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to take issue with the general thrust of the Budget, but the Minister's comments about Japan were particularly inappropriate and ill chosen. It has been in continuous recession for several years and no country would want to be compared with Japan. During the first quarter of this year, output increased by just 0.1 per cent. In my constituency, Pelikan has just made 80 employees redundant, Federal Tait Paper in Inverurie has made 80 employees redundant and, bordering my constituency, Mcintosh Donald and Dyce has made more than 100 employees redundant and there may be more to follow. Manufacturing in Scotland is in a parlous state and the United Kingdom has a record balance of payments deficit. When will the Government address the problems in the manufacturing industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not for one moment underestimate what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Not for one moment does anyone deny the importance of working to close the productivity gap. What we are doing in respect of training and skills, promoting and encouraging research and development in larger firms as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, the role of the Scottish Executive in promoting the Scottish economy and building capacity and partnership with industry and financial services are all part of a picture that we should not be complacent about but in which we are entitled to take some satisfaction. The basic essentials of the Scottish economy are sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the predictions of independent forecasters for Scotland's economy in 2003. Both Cambridge Econometrics and Business Strategies are predicting growth above the long-term average in 2003. That is a prediction of what will happen on the ground. There are challenges for manufacturing and we must not be complacent about the importance of bridging the productivity gap, but the research and development tax credit, changes in corporation tax, simplifying VAT, modernising tax reform for
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
businesses, the new deal, employer training pilots, and Future Skills Scotland all contribute to a picture in which we are entitled to take some satisfaction. Much has been achieved and much remains to be done, but the good news is that we are getting there and the Scottish economy is showing all the signs of making a turn for the better. Jobs are being created, there is hope and some businesses are beginning to experience in their order books the upturn that we are all working for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Financial Secretary recognise that one of the biggest investors in manufacturing is the North sea oil and gas industry? Can he explain to my constituents and those of other hon. Members how taking £5 billion—according to Wood Mackenzie—of its net present value and allocating it to the Treasury will encourage investment? Does he realise that exploration is financed from profits and if he takes away the profits less money is available for exploration? Will he ensure that the Chief Secretary puts his letter in the Library before tomorrow's debate on the relevant clauses of the Finance Bill so that we can understand the logic behind his announcement? Finally, will he explain to his analysts that when drilling an exploration well, if a small well is found the company makes less money and if a large well is found it makes a lot more money? Thirty percent, of a large well in Angola is worth a lot more than 60 per cent. of a small well in the North sea. Some North sea oil companies are still paying marginal tax rates of up to 70 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman mutters and moans into his tie, but the reality is that continental shelf oil and gas companies currently make significantly higher profits than the rest of the UK industry. In 2001, United Kingdom continental shelf—UKCS—companies made a pre-tax return of 34.3 per cent., compared with 11.2 per cent. made by other non-financial companies. It does not seem unreasonable that they should make a fair and proportionate contribution to the United Kingdom's tax resource and to ensuring that we get the public services that we deserve.

I thank the Financial Secretary for his statement, but he introduced his remarks with complacency. I noted phrases such as "the basic position is sound" and "the underlying position is very strong", and when people say such things, it usually means that the current position is absolutely dreadful. He should take a look at some of the redundancy and closure notices around Scotland, which the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) mentioned, or take the advice of the former Minister responsible for industry, Wendy Alexander. Her friends cited as the reason for her resignation that she was totally depressed about the Scottish Executive's inability to come to terms with the problems of the Scottish economy. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh".] That was in the 	<i>Daily Record.</i> If we have reached the position where the Labour party doubts what is in the 	<i>Daily Record</i>, we might soon come to the position where the 	<i>Daily Record</i> starts to doubt the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is crucial. The oil industry, as the Financial Secretary perhaps does not fully realise, actually generates 264,000 jobs across the UK, 31 per cent. of which are in Scotland and 26,000 of which are offshore. It is highly appropriate that this Scottish Grand Committee is debating the subject, given that 90 per cent. of UK oil production and rather more than half of gas production are in Scottish waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not about to paint a picture of the oil industry in which everyone is on their uppers, because I do not believe that they are. Some developments in the industry are pretty rosy. During the past few years, oil has generated some 20 per cent. of UK industrial investment. There were 21 new developments in the North sea last year. The Buzzard field, with far more than 200 million barrels, is the largest accumulation in the North sea for a generation. If we look at the Chancellor's Budget figures, we can see that during the next six years he expects to accrue £33 billion from North sea revenues—£5,000 per head for every man woman and child in Scotland—compared with less than half that sum during the past six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that all hon. Members here have people in their constituencies dependent on the oil and gas industry. I suggest to the Committee that there are some worrying signs at the moment about future North sea development. I have real concerns, which are perhaps shared privately by Labour Members and certainly shared by plenty on these Benches, that some aspects of the Budget changes will make the long-term position in the North sea rather worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard that developments have been increasing as are Treasury revenues, but the figures
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
for exploration and appraisal drilling in the North sea, which tell us what will happen not next year or in five years' time, but in 10, 20 or 30 years' time, make grim reading. In 1996, 112 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled in the waters around Scotland. Last year the number was 51, less than half what it was five years ago. I think that, for the first time, the Department of Trade and Industry—the Minister for Industry and Energy has just joined us, so he can confirm it—did not put out a press release on the oil licensing round. I was surprised about that, until I read the details in the 	<i>Petroleum Newsletter</i>, which tells us that just 12 per cent. of the acreage offered in the UK's latest offshore licensing round has been applied for. It states
	<br><blockquote><p>"The European Offshore Petroleum Newsletter has learnt that 37 countries had applied for only 36 of the 280 blocks offered in the 20th licensing round."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State should be concerned about that, because if she casts her mind back to our previous debate in the Scottish Grand Committee, she will recall that she cited the success of the last licensing round as a reason for confidence in the development of the North sea. By the same token, presumably she accepts that what can modestly be described as the disappointment of the latest licensing round must be a substantial cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget changes must be considered against that background. I want to address them, say a little about infrastructure in the North sea and discuss my concerns about whether the oil and gas directorate in Aberdeen is fulfilling the task that it claimed to be able to do when jobs were relocated some 10 years ago.

I want now turn to last year's debate in the Grand Committee, which I read again last night. It was a remarkably good-natured debate. At one point, the Secretary of State said that I had made several good points, which is not something I am used to hearing from her. Therefore, we can take it that the tenor of the debate was good natured. There was a great deal of consensus about the prospects for the industry, which was summed up best by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg), who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The oil industry in the North sea is doing so well because this Government have provided a stable fiscal regime. When they came to power, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor considered the fiscal regime and took advice from the industry, and those of us from the north-east who advocated leaving well alone."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 28 March 2001; c. 26.]</p></blockquote>
Clearly the hon. Lady's persuasive powers have not been so great in the run-up to this Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for last year's consensus is that there was a general feeling—when the Secretary of State set out the Pilot initiative—that in future the North sea would be considered not simply as a grand source of revenue for the Treasury but in terms of its long-term industrial development. We have come a long way since the atmosphere last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that what took place this year was not a detailed analysis of the prospects for the North sea; nor was it an examination of the taxation changes that were necessary to stimulate employment over the long term. I suspect that, as it was a tight Budget, the Chancellor was scrabbling around for an extra £1 billion a year, which is what the industry will generate in five years' time according to Government forecasts, and that proved an irresistible attraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) and I may differ on this. As I said last year, I do not say that there should be no changes in taxation in the North sea: there is a case that fields which are under production are relatively lightly taxed. However, certain requirements are necessary for anyone introducing taxation changes. The first is to demonstrate that an analysis has been conducted to show that the changes will minimise the impact on employment, jobs and output over the long term. It does not seem that such an analysis has been conducted. If it has, we have still to see it placed in the Library, as was promised last week. It really is extraordinary, given the importance of the industry, that we are still waiting for the Government to demonstrate that they even considered employment prospects in Scotland and elsewhere before they embarked on the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important point. Does he consider the Government's announcement to be extraordinarily ill-timed, given that the companies have not recovered their cash flow from losses caused by the previously depressed oil price and have just completed a round of redundancies that Lord Browne at BP has said may have to be revisited in the light of the tax change? What is the point of having a pre-Budget process if one just announces proposals without consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation point is very important. The last time the Chancellor considered oil tax changes in 1997, the Treasury press release stressed the considering and consulting on changes and the importance of consultation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A consultative document will be published … with the aim of legislation in the next Finance Bill. The industry has requested further consultation on any planned changes and the Government believes that this will be beneficial to the process of developing an appropriate fiscal regime for these activities."</p></blockquote>
What happened? We had consultation, which lasted more than two years. Decisions and assumptions were made—certainly by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South and members of the Committee last year—that there were to be no changes and that stability was the key word for the oil tax regime. This year, without consultation or analysis—certainly, without published analysis—a change has been made that may have damaging consequences for jobs in the constituencies of every single member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us with oil jobs in our constituencies have already seen redundancies in the sector. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) is not in his place, but he knows that up to 1,000 jobs have been lost in the refining sector at BP. There have been job losses in many parts of the oil industry. Considering the employment aspect, it must be said that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
industry needs help. Therefore, to make such a change without consultation seems quite extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We deserve an explanation. Why was there no consultation with the industry? Why has no document been published, as was promised? Did the Scotland Office or, for that matter, the Department of Trade and Industry make any representations to the Chancellor before or after the Budget? Did they know about the changes before Budget day? When did the Secretary of State and the Minister for Industry and Energy find out about the proposed tax changes? Did they support them before the Budget? We know that they support them today—they have no choice—but did they support them before they were announced? Certainly, nothing in the demeanour of the Secretary of State last year when she spoke to the Committee or in any statement from the Minister for Industry and Energy suggested that such a substantial tax change was under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Industry and Energy has followed the Secretary of State in chairing the Pilot initiative. Last year, he spoke eloquently about its success, based on partnership, consultation and information exchange with the industry. Was there any discussion in Pilot of the forthcoming tax changes? I believe that the Minister was about to answer the question, which is pretty straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just acknowledging its existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister acknowledges the existence of the question. He is the chairman of the Pilot initiative. As the Minister, he carries responsibility for the welfare of the industry and for the hundreds of thousands of people employed in it. I think it is entirely reasonable, given the much vaunted role of Pilot as a forum for discussion between Government and industry, to ask a straight question; was there any discussion or consultation in Pilot about the forthcoming substantial tax changes, or were they a total surprise not just to the industry but to the Secretary of State and to the Minister? I hope that the Minister answers that question when he sums up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never taken the position that it is wrong to make any tax change. I can see the argument that there are certain fields in the North sea from which the returns are very high. Capital investment was carried through generations ago and $25 a barrel gives an exceptionally high return. If changes are going to be made, the purpose of consultation is to look at how they can be made in a way in which the impact on exploration and appraisal drilling, which is the seed-corn for the future of the industry, is minimised. Was there any debate or input into whether there could have been an additional uplift for exploration and appraisal drilling?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to say to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) that his comments in the press suggesting that taking £1 billion out of the industry would have either no effect or a beneficial effect on jobs are beyond belief. If one takes £1 billion of revenue out of an industry, it will not have a positive effect on jobs. It might be possible to minimise the impact of that by, for example, offsetting interest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
payments on field development. Instead of abolishing royalties, for example, it would be possible to provide relief based on incremental development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One great feature of the early tax regime in the North sea was that the petroleum revenue tax regime locked in companies to future development. One danger in the present tax regime, particularly when tax goes up, is that there is not much there to stop companies moving elsewhere in the world. When the Secretary of State speaks and the Minister replies, I hope that they will consider such an initiative. The industry has generated £160 billion for the Exchequer over the past 20 years and is expected to generate another £32 billion over the next six years. We are therefore entitled to know whether Scottish jobs were even a factor in the debate before those changes were made. Was there input from the industry, when will an analysis be published and why was it not published at the time of the Budget?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last Grand Committee, I had an exchange with the Minister of State, Scotland Office, about the landing charges at the St. Fergus gas terminal. He wrote to me saying that that had nothing to do with the Government and everything to do with supply and demand because lots of people wanted to land at St. Fergus and the charges were therefore very high. That is not quite true. The reason why the landing charges are high is because the infrastructure has not been put in place to allow the transmission of substantially greater quantities of gas to St. Fergus. St. Fergus's future is reasonably secure, but the Mossmorran plant is dependent on processing liquids that have been landed there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five new pipeline schemes are being considered. Four of those schemes are Norwegian and one is by Marathon oil. Each of them is considering either going to Bacton in Norfolk from the central and northern North sea, or even to Zeebrugge. Those options would be bad not only for Scottish employment and jobs, but for revenue for the Exchequer. If the pipeline goes from Norway to Bacton, the only revenue that will accrue to the Exchequer is corporation tax on the last six miles of the pipeline. There is presently a fiscal advantage for companies to take gas to Bacton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the pipeline goes to Zeebrugge it will be even worse. The Chancellor has just increased the tax take from the North sea, but if gas is landed at Zeebrugge and brought through the interconnector pipeline to Bacton, tax will only be paid at 30 per cent. The Government are building into the system a tax structure that discriminates against landfall points in Scotland and investment in the North sea. I hope that there has been further consideration of those matters to prevent that happening in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an example, the Shell pipeline to St. Fergus, the FLAGS system, was the major pipeline system in North sea, but it is operating at about 50 per cent. of its capacity. Because of the tax structure that has been introduced, the taxation and tariff on it will be more than 70 per cent. To send gas through a new pipeline system will cost either 40 per cent. to Bacton or 30 per cent. to Zeebrugge. The Minister looks surprised, but that is the taxation system that operates for the North sea, which positively discriminates against landing gas
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
at St. Fergus. I hope that the Minister appreciates the extent of what is happening in taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I spoke to Marathon about the proposed pipeline development to Bacton, I was given information that caused me concern. I was told that when the company was undertaking field development for Brae Field in quadrant 16—north of the central North sea and well north east of Aberdeen—as a change, it had to travel to the oil and gas directorate in London. I made inquiries and found that the Tiffany and Balmoral fields were having to do the same, as were British Gas, Armada and Blake fields. The Britannia operation consortium, based at Rubislaw in Aberdeen, also has to travel to London. I know that British Airways' finances have been sketchy recently, but I should like to know whether the grand strategy to boost the finances of British Airways is to make companies travel to the directorate in London to talk about field development plans. Far from transferring jobs and responsibilities north, there has been in recent months a transfer of more and more sea sectors back to London and the DTI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 10 years ago, the Select Committee on Energy battled to achieve a transfer of jobs, not on the basis of 80 civil posts being vital—80 more posts in any constituency is good news—but on the basis that having the key decision-making jobs in the north-east of Scotland would mean that a company's headquarters, its development and project teams would also be based there. I have heard the Minister for Industry and Energy say on radio and television that the Buzzard field is an exciting new development; indeed, it is. However, it is in block 20 of the North sea. Where are the directorate jobs? Where will the DTI decision makers be based for the development of consultation in that new field? My information is that it will be London again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If decision making is in London, Pan-Canadian will have a great temptation to locate its project there because it will otherwise be in the position of Marathon, British Gas and Britannia of having to send project teams to London to talk about developments, which are not in the southern North sea or the Irish area, but in the northern North sea. The Minister has carelessly allowed that situation to develop despite all efforts to build up responsibilities in Aberdeen. I hope that he will provide a substantial explanation of whether over the past few months there has been a reversal of decision making in the DTI oil directorate under his tutelage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that other Members would like to speak because, despite the complacency of Government Benches, I detect huge concern not just from constituencies in key oil-producing areas of Scotland, but throughout the country. People recognise that jobs, livelihoods and the long-term future of the North sea are at stake. I repeat that I do not mind a tax change, so long as analysis has been done on minimising its impact on jobs. We have a crisis situation in the number of exploration and appraisal wells being drilled. The 20th licensing round was certainly not a resounding success; in fact, it was an appalling failure. That is a key indication of what will happen, not in five or 10 years, but in 15, 20 or 25
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
years. I hope that the Government have not reverted to the position, which we thought had passed, of grabbing as much revenue as possible from the North sea, filling the Treasury coffers, and having no concern for the long-term development and future employment prospects of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no consultation on the changes, which I suspect were a surprise even to the Secretary of State—she probably heard about them on the morning of the Budget, and no analysis of the impact of the changes on jobs and investment has been published. Unless we have substantial answers to those substantial questions, the Government will be indicted for sacrificing and jeopardising employment prospects in Scotland to fill up the Treasury coffers through the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite surprised that we are having yet another debate on the energy industry at the behest of the Scottish National Party.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

We had a further debate on energy policy a few months ago. I can only conclude that the SNP has only one string to its bow. From the 1970s, the party has gone back to oil and gas repeatedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) began his remarks with an attack on the Financial Secretary. I find that quite peculiar, given that only a week ago today, his party leader made the point to SNP Members that they must stop whingeing for Scotland. At last, the SNP leader has listened to what our party has said about whingeing for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is that whingeing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman—as always from a sedentary position—asks why that is whingeing. He whinges about the performance of the economy, and manages to completely forget the fact that, in his constituency, the actions of the Government have led to a reduction in unemployment of 48 per cent., extra help for 2,795 businesses, and benefit from the working families tax credit for 1,547 families. Real people in Banff and Buchan are benefiting from the policies of this Government and he does not want to acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman's speech, which was great coming from someone who has built his career on tax and spend. He is the man who asked for a "penny for Scotland" and said that "if you tax the people, the people will respond", but now we know it is only the people who have to be taxed. The hon. Gentleman's speech would have given great credit to J.R. Ewing because it was in favour of big oil. I have a great degree of respect for the oil industry, but I also recognise that it is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
profitable and successful industry. Taxation that is levied against it should be fair to all of the economy. There should be no favoured classes in the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at the moment. Issues must be confronted in relation to the future of the oil and gas industry, not least of which is the maturity of the North sea. We have discussed that on several occasions in this Committee. The work that has been done with Pilot was of critical importance to ensuring that we maintain an oil and gas industry in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the review of taxation undertaken in 1998, the industry has recognised that the Chancellor has always kept open the option of reviewing the taxation structure in the oil and gas industry. In 1998, shortly after the review commenced, it was pretty clear that the bottom was falling out of oil prices. The price of oil went down to $10 a barrel. The Government responded, and the oil price has since gone up more than $30 dollars a barrel. It is now fluctuating around $25 dollars a barrel. Should not the British people benefit from the profits that are accrued from that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State explain why that is not related to the price of oil? If the price of oil falls again, companies still have to pay the tax. Is she suggesting that they have to guess when the Chancellor is next going to change his mind on investment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pretty puny statement from the hon. Gentleman. He usually makes quite coherent speeches on the oil and gas industry. The Chancellor has a right to review the fiscal regime across the board for all industries. In 1998, two areas of taxation were considered; petroleum revenue tax and a supplemental charge on the oil companies' profits. The oil industry knew that those were under review and campaigned vociferously against a petroleum revenue tax. My hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy, the chair of Pilot, and I have been lobbied formally and informally on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it absolutely clear that he would rule nothing out. Chancellors do not rule anything out in advance of their Budgets. The measure that he has taken on the supplemental tax—which, as the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan completely forgot to mention is linked to first-year allowances to encourage exploration and development, with the abolition of royalties—is a balanced proposal aimed at ensuring that the maximum possible revenue comes back for the good of the British people. Why did my right hon. Friend the Chancellor conclude that he wished to maximise revenues? He did so to put money into the health service and to ensure that every member of the population benefited from a health service fit for the 21st century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan seeks to intervene on me, although I did not seek to intervene on him at all. The last time the hon. Gentleman addressed this Committee, he spoke for 40 minutes, which meant that no Back Benchers could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
intervene at all but, on this occasion, I will give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of long speeches, the Secretary of State should look at her own record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that she prepared her comments earlier. I did not argue that there should not be taxation changes for the North sea. I made suggestions about how to minimise the impact on jobs and investment. I have two straight questions. Was there consultation on Pilot before the changes were announced? What is the Secretary of State's assessment of the impact of those changes, and will she publish that assessment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My assessment of the jobs impact is that if we link the supplemental tax on profits to the first-year allowances and the abolition of royalties, we should minimise impact on our jobs. I am not going to put figures on that. Frankly, the hon. Gentleman has based his entire economic policy on North sea oil and gas. We are discussing an industry subject to fluctuations that relate to fluctuations in the global economy. I am not going to get involved in that, but we have created a fiscal regime, not just for the North sea but for the entire economy, that means that business has the most favourable taxation regime and business climate that it is had for many a long year in this country, and one that is much better than in other parts of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked if there was consultation in Pilot. Yes, there was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy will be winding up later, and I hope that at that point he will draw the Committee's attention to some of the positive developments that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan managed to overlook. Only a few weeks ago, the announcement came that Foster Wheeler had been awarded a £60 million contract to build the onshore gas processing facilities at St. Fergus, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, for Shell UK's Goldeneye development. That is very good news for Scotland, for the UK and for the oil industry. It will create more than 400 new jobs in Scotland and, more widely in the United Kingdom, up to 300 construction jobs—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I notice that whenever we are talking about good news, some hon. Members cannot bear to listen. All they want is decline and failure; they are whingeing for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be 400 new jobs in Scotland and others more widely in the UK. There will be 300 construction jobs, 70 specialist posts at Foster Wheeler in Glasgow, permanent jobs created at St. Fergus and jobs secured at the Fife NGL plant as Mossmorran. There are other success stories. The Buzzard field is larger than was originally thought, with 300 million barrels of oil; an understatement of around 100 million barrels of oil. Clair field has been talked about by this Committee for as long as I have been a member of it. The £650 million proposed development there will make another significant contribution. Enterprise Oil proposes to develop the Howe field, while Veba aims to develop the Clapham field. On the gas condensates side, the Atlantic and Cromarty fields are going ahead, which all adds to the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
That shows how much the UK oil and gas industry contributes to the UK economy; it should not be used as a political football by Opposition Members. During 2001, export figures for the oil and gas industry were even better than we anticipated when this Committee previously discussed the industry. Oil exports reached more than £6 billion and exports of gas hydrocarbons increased by 93 per cent. to £143 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan always fails to talk about the extent to which the skills and expertise of the oil and gas industry are now exportable. The export of professional services from the industry accounted for a further £670 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I intend to make progress because I have a number of Back Benchers behind me; the hon. Gentleman does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the next five critical years we must be certain that the industry can build on its strengths, develop new and innovative technologies and strengthen collaboration throughout the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan referred to Pilot, which is a great success because it is collaborative. Instead of looking at the world through the prism of the SNP, Pilot looks at the oil and gas industry in reality and the challenges that it will face. I said that the hon. Gentleman had a myopic view of what is happening in the oil and gas industry. It has been recognised over the years that a number of the oil majors have been sitting on fallow field. A number of independent companies have expressed an interest in those fallow fields and when I was an Energy Minister I encouraged them to open up those fields for redevelopment. I recognise the significant targets that Pilot has met. Its target of producing 3 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2010, CAPEX investment maintained at £3 billion a year by 2010, and a 50 per cent. increase in the value of industry-related exports by 2005 are all on target, but there is still much to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the United Kingdom continental shelf today, there are some 250 fallow fields and 200 unused licences. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan was happy to talk about licences when referring to the 20th round, but less happy to talk about the fact that there are so many unused licences. A DTI search showed that those fields could play an important part in meeting the ambitious investment target of £3 billion each year. While the oil price remains buoyant, the prospect of developing those fields must increase, and that is where the Chancellor's additional assistance and first-year allowances are particularly valuable. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan does not recognise that, but perhaps his hon. Friend who will wind up the debate will be gracious enough to acknowledge the work that the Chancellor has done in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's determination to ensure that those licences should be in the hands of companies that want to develop them is undiminished. Hundreds of fallow fields and unused licences are a luxury that this country can no longer afford. The UK's licensing regime has been generous. We have traditionally given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
operators a lot of time and flexibility to determine the pace of development, but in the present life cycle of the UK continental shelf—it is a mature regime—we are entitled to ask for firm plans or alterative proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the oil industry being concerned about changes in taxation. The Chancellor made it clear in the Budget that his intention is to put the fiscal regime on a sustainable, long-term basis to reduce uncertainty and provide further investment. The hon. Gentleman says that he wants one industry to be favoured above another. The UK regime is one of the most competitive in the world and the Budget measures help to achieve that. The reform that has been introduced ensures that companies that are making profits from the exploitation of our natural resources pay a fair share of the taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan dismisses the 100 per cent. first-year allowance for capital expenditure in the North sea. It is something that the industry has much relished. Roll-over relief was introduced two years ago. The industry has asked for the abolition of royalties—the process of consultation is now beginning on that—but it is all about fair shares. The Chancellor's Budget is aimed at fairness, as well as at encouraging long-term investment. Let us not forget that the oil industry also benefits from the changed corporation tax regime and the other fiscal measures introduced by the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has said, the typical government tax as a proportion of pre-tax net present value is only 35 per cent. in the UK at present. It will rise to 40 per cent. after the proposed changes. The Scottish nationalists are always happy to refer to Norway as a shining example of a small nation. The tax there is 85 per cent., in the Gulf of Mexico it is 66 per cent. and in Canada, it is 70 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put in place a framework for a modernised taxation regime for North sea oil, which will help to promote the long-term future of the North sea oil industry and bring benefits to the economy. In doing so, it will, more particularly, help to create the kind of society in the 21st century that the Chancellor set out in his Budget speech. It is about fairness and stability and about ensuring that those who contribute most to the economy—the general population of the United Kingdom—benefit from one of our most profitable industries. There are no special categories; as the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan would want, there is fairness across the board. I believe that the Chancellor has achieved that for the oil and gas industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is difficult to know where to start after that speech by the Secretary of State. In many ways George Orwell would have been proud of her spirit. She finished her speech by talking about stability, enterprise and fairness coming from the Budget. She said that there should not be a special case for the oil and gas industry, but the Chancellor has created one for the North sea industry. He has made its tax regime worse than if it was an onshore business, worse in comparison to the previous tax regime and less competitive than it was before the Budget compared with investing in other parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was also worried about Members supporting big businesses. Many of us are concerned because we are supporting our constituents. In Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, 40,000 people are employed by companies working directly in the oil industry as well as all the other people employed in the north-east of Scotland in ancillary industries who support them with their spending power as members of the community; decorators, joiners, people looking after their houses and people using their local shops. All that money comes into our local economy from this industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that collective Cabinet responsibility means that Ministers have to make speeches that somehow justify what the Chancellor puts in his Budget, but it is most unusual in this Committee for an SNP spokesman to be allowed to make a speech without a single intervention from a Government Member. That reveals that the Government feel that they are on weak ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Until the Treasury understands it, the damage will continue to be done. Tomorrow, we will debate the clauses in the Finance Bill that relate to the measure, and it would be extremely helpful if the Secretary of State reinforced the message to the Chief Secretary to get his letter into the Library in time to inform tomorrow's debate. It will still be late because those outside will not have a chance to look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State also says that the tax should not come as a surprise to the industry because of the nature of the discussions that have come before. I can

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
assure her—privately, she knows it—that it surprised the industry. I have spoken to people either connected with the industry or working at various levels within it, and they have exhibited genuine surprise. It was not synthetic surprise because the tax was a shock. The Chancellor has thrown stability out of the window. How does the industry know when he will next raid the North sea? When will he raid other businesses that are extremely successful? He is currently encouraging biotechnology, but if that takes off, will he introduce a biotechnology windfall tax? That is no way to encourage inward investment or to run a successful economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely important to recognise that there is a long-term issue. Another generation could get jobs in the North sea because there is another generation of work out there. When the issue was debated in a previous Grand Committee, there was talk about the need to encourage people in school to look to the oil industry as a long-term career. The industry will have a long-term future if it receives investment and is allowed to thrive in a stable climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the Financial Secretary dismissed the importance of the North sea oil and gas industry to the UK economy was frighteningly complacent. He also missed another aspect of the industry, which is not necessarily related to the economy; namely the importance of the industry to our security of supply. The Minister for Industry and Energy called for an energy review on the basis that, when North sea oil and gas run out, he will be concerned about our future mix of energy supplies and their stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary says that the industry is unimportant. However, the Minister for Industry and Energy is arguing that the industry is important not only for financial reasons, but because of the great luxury of piping gas ashore from our area of control. If we can pipe our own gas ashore, we can maintain the luxury of security that other nations envy. Anything that undermines investment will leave gas in the North sea. If fields are closed down prematurely or if we fail to explore undrilled exploration wells to look for the last small fields to tie to major fields, the fields left in the ground will be lost to future generations for ever. That would mean the Treasury losing future financing for the health service and the country losing its future security of supply. The more we can do to sustain the industry, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most depressing things coming back from people working in the industry is that there comes a time when an industry starts to look at a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
province in which it is operating and decides that it is not going to do any more exploration or enhancement of production because it is time to harvest what is left. The Chancellor has, however, gone into harvesting mode before the industry was ready. Profits from current production finance future exploration. Companies do not borrow to explore but use their profits. In his reply, perhaps the Minister for Industry and Energy will say whether he agrees with the analysis by Wood Mackenzie that the net present value transferred from companies to Government is of the order of £5 billion. That is money that could be invested. On a percentage basis, I would be surprised if it was not more. The industry is concerned by the figure, which could actually be £6 billion. The feedback that we have been getting since the Budget indicates that it is a growing concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being here for the earlier speeches, but I was chairing a Select Committee. The hon. Gentleman's position is supported only by the giant oil companies, which want to put the profits in their back pockets. We share a position in terms of the oil and gas group. The smaller players have been saying for a long time that if the bigger companies would give them a chance, give up some of the fields that they are holding on to and let them get into the industry, they would be willing to invest. There are profits in the North sea for many generations to come, but the big companies are hanging on to them. They should share some of them with the people of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand small companies. I had a conversation with a friend during a May day bank holiday picnic with our children. She works in an accountancy office. Someone from a small, North sea business phoned her and asked, "What on earth does the Budget mean for us? Do we have to put all our plans on hold?" Is that the way to treat small business? Is it right to pull the rug from under their feet in the middle of attempts to restructure their business? That is not the way to encourage investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor could have announced the strategy that he wanted to explore and entered into a dialogue. That would have dealt with the stability angle. He could have considered other changes to enhance exploration. The most frightening complacency has been demonstrated by Government Members in the debate on the Budget and on the Finance Bill—and, to a certain extent, by the Secretary of State for Scotland—on relating the profit tax to the current price of oil. If any industry is cyclical, it is the oil industry. It makes huge profits when the price is high but does not make much profit when the price is low. On that basis, companies manage their business investment portfolio and make exploration decisions. The frightening thing that the Treasury and Government Back Benchers are saying in an attempt to justify the tax in the short term is the hint that, perhaps, it will be dropped when the price of oil falls. Obviously, it would be welcome if the Government took the tax away when oil prices fell, but that does not exactly encourage forward planning.

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
An investment manager in Calgary or Houston cannot be expected to say that they will put more money into the UK because next year the Chancellor might cut the tax rate. The tax rate should be understandable and predictable for the long term. If the tax has been introduced because of a high price, why is there no indication of the price at which it will be phased out? At least that would provide a marginal understanding of what was happening. Tomorrow, some of the clauses of the Bill will be dealt with in Committee. I hope that we will have some real changes from the Treasury by Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not allow finance costs to be set against the new tax. The Government want to encourage investment, but one of the ways to invest is through borrowing. Obviously, borrowing costs money. It is an extremely unusual tax regime that does not allow a company to set such costs against its tax. It must be possible for the Treasury to devise a more sophisticated way of ensuring that the correct finance costs are allocated against the profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to take a shot at large businesses, because they are big and faceless. BP is a lovely target; it makes lots of money. However, BP makes only 15 per cent. of its profits in the UK, and not all of that is from the North sea. The tax applies only to the profits that it makes in the United Kingdom. The profits that it makes in Angola, the gulf of Mexico and Alaska are not subject to the tax. If it invests more in Alaska or Angola, it does not pay the tax. It is an easy hit for political consumption to say that there is a higher tax regime in Angola, but the fields are so much larger. If one were to drill a hole in the ground there and find a field 100 times bigger than one in the North sea, the return that one would make during the lifetime of that field would be so much more rewarding, even with a 70 per cent. top-rate tax regime—I understand the regime is price sensitive—than paying 40 per cent. on a tiny incremental field in the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady not understand that the Chancellor is encouraging companies to go to Angola rather than use the North sea? He is driving them away from the North sea. The right place for them to invest is in the North sea, where we have a regime that looks after the environment in a way that many other countries do not and looks after health and safety. However, Government Members do not understand the distinction. Business units in the North sea are being taxed, not the parent oil companies. That message has to get through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject for debate is not "North sea oil and gas taxation"; it is actually "North sea oil and gas
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
industry", and there are a couple of other issues behind the scenes. The Secretary of State talked about exporting skills. One of the key factors in the export of skills is having a home base from which skills are operated, which means investing there. The other key factor is making it as easy as possible for new entrants. At a recent meeting with the Aberdeen and Grampian chamber of commerce, I was impressed by its work in promoting the export of skills, and particularly its work in promoting the chances for smaller companies to get involved in fields such as Angola; there are chances to take part in the economy there. The work done by the chamber of commerce is something that I would hope that the Secretary of State and the Minister—when they have stopped whispering to each other—considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Away from the tax issue, it would be helpful if there were constructive dialogue on what can be done to help the economy and businesses of north-east Scotland. The Minister is probably well aware of the work of the chamber of commerce and I hope that he could look at ways of encouraging that work. It allows small companies to find a foothold in the fields, and once they have the confidence, they have the chance to expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan about pipelines. The Government must reconsider some of the marginal tax rates on the older infrastructure in the North sea to encourage tie-backs and to encourage Norwegian gas to our shores so that the Chancellor gets a bigger cut in the long run. We all want to see long-term investment in the North sea, not just for our constituents' jobs—although that is a primary concern—but for jobs throughout the United Kingdom. That message has to get through to the rest of the House between now and the Report stage of the Finance Bill. We are concerned about security of supply, and enabling future generations to maximise the resource. It is not our right to exploit the resource in the short term to get the Treasury out of a short-term fix, because that would damage the long-term potential that still exists in the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will be as brief as I can. I want to consider some of the myths that are being peddled by Opposition parties about the oil industry and the way in which taxation operates. The Opposition Front Bench spokesmen who have spoken are very experienced in the oil industry and they should know better. The first myth that I want to tackle is the idea that the North sea is somehow ring-fenced. It is not, except on the issue of taxation in the UK. No profits remain in the UK except for those made by UK companies. All profits from the North sea after taxation go back to Houston,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Dallas, San Francisco, New Jersey or, perhaps, to London if the company is based in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment decisions are the same. They are not made on the basis of the profits made in the North sea in the previous year or years. Each company has its own pot of money to invest in the oil industry. The company will make a balanced decision about the profitability of the North sea against that of Kazakhstan, Angola, Nigeria or western Australia. Various elements come into the decision, including the amount of money already invested in the various locations and the return that is made. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already made the point that the oil industry last year made a return of 34.2 per cent. on its capital employed. That is an attractive return, and it is taxed at a much lower rate than in any other oil-producing country in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) said earlier, "It is damn right that it is more profitable in Angola." That is not the case.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other expenses in Angola that are not taken into account. Another myth is that the oil industry is interested only in financial stability. It is interested in both financial and political stability. We should consider some of the countries in which the oil industry operates, such as Angola, Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and some of those into which it is moving, such as Iran and some middle east countries. The comparative political stability of the United Kingdom is extremely important in decision making. A company does not have to pay the extra cost of protecting its pipelines with a private army. There is no graft to pay to Government Ministers. Those are additional costs that affect the attractiveness or otherwise of a particular area. That is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) has already alluded to the idea of the industry being unified. Of course the oil industry is upset about the increased taxation; we would all be upset about such increases. The reaction is predictable, but the industry is not unified. Certain people have examined and analysed the impact of the tax and found that they will be losers, but there are many gainers, including companies new to the North sea, such as Talisman. Its chief executive is starting to see the positives. In discussions elsewhere in the House, Members of all parties have talked about the future of the North sea. That future lies with companies such as Talisman and Tuscan, which are able to go into new territories. They are relatively small at the moment, but they are taking the risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan rightly made the point that there is a serious problem with exploration at the moment. That started after the 1993 Budget, when the financial stability of the oil industry was rocked because the then Conservative Government changed taxes overnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oil companies have become risk-averse. Professor Alec Kemp produced an analysis three or four years ago of the amount of money involved in drilling wells in the North sea, and their success rate. He discovered that one in 14 wells was successful. That is money down the drain. It is an activity for which there is no tax relief and which the banks will not finance; the money comes out of cash flow. Clearly, there are some difficulties in that area, and I hope that it will be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the 1993 Budget because it seems to have escaped the collective memory of the oil industry. It is illustrative to examine what happened then. I always listen carefully to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, and I was interested in what he had to say. What we have to remember about the SNP's approach to the oil and gas industry is that, for 40 years—since the North sea oil industry was a gleam in the eye—it has been telling us that Scotland could be independent and that oil and gas would pay for it. The SNP is always looking across the North sea to Norway and saying that Scotland could be like that, but Norway charges up to 88 per cent. on its oil and gas revenue. I do not understand where the party's sums come from. It is changing its policy? Has it ditched the old policy in order to pay for an independent Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key aspect of the hon. Gentleman's speech was that it included not one sentence of SNP policy. It was a continual attack on what everyone else has had to say. For example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has had most of the morning; I shall finish this point and then I will happily give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1993 Budget, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer changed the tax regime in the North sea overnight. That was extremely beneficial to certain oil companies. Those companies—such as BP, Shell and Esso—that are complaining about the present changes were major beneficiaries of the 1993 Budget. However, companies such as Texaco, Conoco and Amerada Hess, were major sufferers in 1993. To set the scene, the tax changes of 1993 were made at a time when oil prices were low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's speech was virtually the same one that he made in the Budget debate in 1993; scaremongering about jobs, the collapse of the Scottish economy and all the rest. However, he made one important point, which is relevant to today's debate. He said that a case could be made for increasing oil taxation at boom times, because oil is a cyclical industry. We are in a boom time now; over the past three years, oil companies have made record profits. We all know that that will not be sustainable because it is a volatile industry and depends on so many factors, particularly politics. For instance, none of us can be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
confident about the situation in the middle east, particularly with the threat of action in Iraq and what is happening between Palestine and Israel. However, the words never change; the focus of attack is the only thing that changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1993, the Tory Government took £700 million out of the oil economy. As I said, BP, Shell, Esso and the other companies that are complaining now were silent then because they supported that change. The companies that lost out then did so in exactly the same way as those losing out now. The United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association is now running a campaign telling us how bad the Budget is—it is using tactics similar to those used by the Opposition—and about the threats that it poses to the Scottish economy and the risks that are faced by the oil industry. In 1993, however, UKOOA was silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another myth is that the industry has an effective voice. The industry has an effective voice only when it is unified. In 1993, it was not unified; only the small players are complaining now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor is following a consistent line through Pilot—and the oil industry task force before it—of encouraging new development and investment. I hope that royalty payments will be abolished soon, and certainly before the next tax year, but when that change is completed, taxation will be based entirely on profits. That is the fairest way of taxing the industry. In addition, capital reliefs will encourage investment in new fields and old. In particular, new entrepreneur companies such as Talisman and Tuscan, which the North sea oil industry desperately needs to ensure its future, will be even more encouraged, despite all the huffing and puffing from Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw attention to the complacent remarks made by the Financial Secretary. He needs to be aware that the oil and gas industry is an irreplaceable part of the United Kingdom's economy. In 2001, investment in exploration and field developments for all of the UK continental shelf amounted to £4 billion. That figure is incredible, especially when we consider that it accounts for 15 per cent. of all industrial investment for the UK in that year. More than 264,000 jobs in the UK depend on that investment continuing. Those and many more jobs have faced the uncertainties of day-to-day fluctuations in price with an eye on the long term, in which the most successful and sustainable investment is surely based. It has not been mentioned, but the industry is vital to many millions of UK shareholders who have built their pensions and savings on multinational oil investments, often based in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry has formed a key part of the performance and innovation unit's energy review, published shortly after the Grand Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
meeting in February. The Government have rightly set their sights on a balanced energy policy for the future. However, that will depend significantly on the continuing supplies of oil and gas from the North sea. Given the time scales involved in nuclear construction, natural gas supplies will have to bear the brunt of our commitment to our key Kyoto targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the response to the energy review, James May, the director general of the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Diversity of supply at competitive prices is fundamental to achieving security of supply. North Sea oil and gas have a major role in maintaining that diversity, as well as bringing other substantial benefits to the UK in terms of Treasury revenues, jobs and the development and export of new technologies and skills."</p></blockquote>
It is worth considering how the Government believe that the provisions in this year's Finance Bill will contribute—or not—towards maximizing the benefits to which Mr. May alludes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The submissions by the UKOOA and Amerada Hess pointed out the critical part in the industry's development played by fiscal stability. The industry awaited the Budget statement on 17 April with some optimism. It had been subjected to that most dreadful of experiences, a Government charm offensive. The Treasury made clear its belief that the industry would be best left to develop alone. The Chancellor stated, in his pre-Budget report of 2000:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can tell the House that I am determined not to make short-term decisions based on short-term factors. The key issue is the level of long-term investment in the North sea. This will be the approach that will guide Budget decisions in future".—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 8 November 2000; Vol. 356, c. 317.]</p></blockquote>
That is another Labour promise broken to industry in Scotland. Make no mistake, the decision to raise an extra 10 per cent. tax on UK oil production has sent all the wrong messages to the UK oil and gas sector. The tax rate, now at 40 per cent., will mean that this most multi-national of industries will have more reason than ever to look outside the UKCS for its development expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the manner of the change suggests the importance with which the Chancellor and the Financial Secretary regard the income from upstream taxation. They view it as a cash cow—a revenue stream—to be milked for all that it is worth at a moment's notice. Given the importance of fiscal stability, to inflict that tax hike at nine hours' notice was truly astonishing, and has been roundly condemned. The Chancellor has shown himself to be consummately skilled at one thing; picking victims for his tax hikes. This follows the example of his daylight robbery on the pensions industry, with the abolition of dividend tax credits. Like that change, the tax on oil production could have a devastating effect on its industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to Wood Mackenzie, the first increase in taxation in the industry for 20 years marks a watershed. It projects that the average Government take on remaining production has increased overnight from 40.1 per cent. to 46.5 per cent. The stock market—which, I understand, is not a priority for Labour Members—reacted with understandable horror. BP and Shell shares fell by 1.5 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
immediately and Amanda Harvie, chief executive of the Aberdeen and Grampian chamber of commerce, made it clear that there would be a effect on jobs. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine may verify what the chief executive said, after his meeting with her. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These changes will not just affect the major oil players, but the countless small businesses operating in the supply chain."</p></blockquote>
Members of the Committee will be aware that small businesses that operate on tight margins and in labour-intensive support services will already be flinching at the prospect of the Chancellor's increase in national insurance contributions. The effect on the sector could be much worse should the oil price fall; indeed, any significant downward movement could end in a grinding halt to marginal investment. The proposal will serve only one purpose; to ensure that less of our remaining reserves will be exploited. Only Venezuela and Argentina have increased oil production costs in the past 10 years. Our ambition should be much greater than that for Scotland's oil and gas industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During recent debates, in press comments and in today's debate, Liberal Democrats have expressed understandable indignation about the changes. They have lambasted the Government for their attack on the oil & gas sector. The hon. Members for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine have, rightly, been vocal in their criticism. It was with some regret, therefore—although it came as no surprise—that I failed to locate those hon. Members when I looked around the No Lobby when voting against the Finance Bill on Second Reading. I voted against it, among other reasons, because of its assault on Scotland's oil industry. With typical Liberal duplicity, they contrived to vote in support of the same proposals that they had sought to denigrate. I shall leave it to the electors of north-east Scotland to pass their verdict in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman, as a new Member, may not understand the workings of Parliament. A Second Reading vote simply allows the Bill to go on to its Committee stage. On the Floor of the House, we shall consider amendments that we have tabled to change the proposals and support other amendments to that effect. We want to change that clause of the Finance Bill and, indeed, prevent it from coming into force. The hon. Gentleman should recognise that it is the Government who are the problem, and that it would be better if we united to speak up for our constituents and targeted our guns on the Government rather than squabbling in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I arrived in the House as a new Member, I understood that voting for a Bill on Second Reading showed one's support for it in principle. I would have thought that it presented hon. Members with a sincere constituency interest with an opportunity to stand up for those constituents and make their point clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government sought to placate public opinion by talk of abolishing the royalty tax. The industry is not fooled and will be the worse for it. First, the proposal is only to consult on abolition of the tax. We look forward to the Minister telling us when that
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
might happen, but we know from painful past experience that such a proposal often equates to a kick into the long grass from new Labour. We remember the consultation that did not happen before the changes that we are discussing were made in the Finance Bill. In any case, the net effect of the two changes, should they both be implemented, will still be a net additional cost on future investment. Future investment must be encouraged, and that has been sacrificed in this Budget proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must serve a purpose. In this case, it must send a clear message to the Government that they have failed, and are failing, the North sea oil and gas industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. I am glad to take the opportunity to speak, even if only briefly—my 15-minute speech will now be cut down to two minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Scottish National party on securing a debate on the future of the oil and gas industry. I make no apologies for talking about the important issue of oil fabrication, which is an important industry that employs engineers, welders, scaffolders and others. Over the years, they have contributed to building oil platforms and floating production vessels, especially in my constituency in Ardersier, which in its time had the largest oil fabrication yard in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My message, in 45 seconds, is that we should not forget the importance of the oil fabrication industry. I should like the oil companies to set up a Scottish contingency fund, which could be used in sectors where there has been devastation—in Ardersier, for example. We should decommission the 1,000 acre site, and consider retraining staff and entering new markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue, which I shall cover in my remaining 30 seconds, concerns the future of the Goldeneye contract and other important contracts for the industry. We must fight for the industry. After all, there have been some positive developments. For example, when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was Minister for Energy, she licensed the white zone—the deep water that stretches to the Faroe islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may consider the case, too, of the BP Clair platform—both the jacket and the topside. One hopes that it will go to Nigg, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso), which is an important part of the Highlands. We should consider the track record. The design work for Clair has gone to the United States, the installation work to Italy and the accommodation to Norway. In the last two seconds of my speech, I make this simple plea: build the platform in Britain. Even better, build it in the very efficient yard that we have in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to wind up for the Scottish National party in this important debate. I declared my interest as a vice-chairman of the all-party group on the offshore oil and gas industry. I represent a constituency in which the industry provides considerable levels of employment. Sadly, my constituency has experienced high levels of unemployment in the industry and an export of jobs, as have many constituencies throughout the north of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since my election I have enjoyed the non-partisan approach on the oil and gas industry, with partnership, collaboration and co-operation with the Secretary of State for Scotland. We have worked hand in hand with those on the Pilot project, which is an innovative and positive way in which to embrace the oil and gas industry, Government and associated sectors. That is why I am frustrated and disappointed about so much that has happened recently. I am not simply whingeing but standing up for the concerns of those who work in the industry— just as the hon. Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) rightly stood up for the concerns of his constituents. We in the Scottish National party, and hon. Members from other parties, have taken the decision to stand up for our constituents. It is a right and proper thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry's concerns stem not only from the multinationals that make the multimillions; they are also expressed by the small and medium-sized businesses. I am surprised that more Labour Members have not referred to that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were we surprised by some of the measures in the Budget? The element of surprise has been denied and no reference has been made to the Treasury Committee's second report on the Budget, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CBI told us that the new supplementary corporation tax charge of 10 per cent. on profits was ‘both a surprise and a disappointment’ … We agree."</p></blockquote>
It is no surprise that the industry has reacted with unease to the Budget and its effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several speakers have stressed the importance of the industry throughout Scotland, especially in the north and north-east of Scotland, where 40,000 jobs depend directly on the industry. I was interested to note the response of the UKOOA to the Budget, as it represents more than 30 off-shore operations and companies. The association warned that the tax measures, proposed without consultation, could
	<br><blockquote><p>"undermine investor confidence in the long-term viability of the UK Continental Shelf."</p></blockquote>
The industry is important to the coffers of large and small companies and to the people who work in it, but it plays a significant role in all our lives because of the thousands of men and women who face danger working in it. I have just received the news that 100 men are being airlifted to safety from a gas rig in the North sea that was hit by a fishing production factory vessel. I am sure that all hon. Members join me in extending our best wishes to them and to those involved in the rescue operation. The industry is important and dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
I commend the hon. Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber on raising the issue of jobs in fabrication. We represent neighbouring constituencies, and a sizable number of our constituents, as well as people from constituencies further north, have been involved in oil yard construction. About 18 months ago, KBR at Nigg employed 3,000 people, but it now employs 100. I am certain that that is not what the Secretary of State meant when she talked with pride about job exports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moray trade union council delegates have called for pressure to be exerted on oil companies to give work to domestic yards. I entirely agree with the Local Authority Standing Committee on Oil Fabrication, which notes that the loss of major contracts to overseas yards poses a serious threat to the future of jobs. LASCOF has highlighted research that suggests that the current number of active yards will be halved, to three or four, unless work is secured. That is not whingeing, but expressing the concerns of trade unionists in the north and other parts of Scotland. It does not behove hon. Members who claim to stand for the interests of trade unions and their members to disparage those concerns as whingeing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently met Mr. Jimmy Gray, the chairman of LASCOF, who is an Inverness Labour councillor. He emphasised the urgency of the situation and sought help in persuading the Government to do more to support oil fabrication jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Labour councillor in my constituency recently said in 	<i>The Northern Scot</i>:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the past three years Britain has lost 20,000 fabrication jobs".</p></blockquote>
I agree that the continuing decline in manufacturing under Labour is extremely disappointing, and I hope that every effort can and will be made to ensure that the potential at Nigg is not thrown away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be well aware that BP recently took its latest platform to Norway. What is he doing about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that I do. I am the first to welcome developments in manufacturing, fabrication and exploration that the Secretary of State has called positive. We should, however, look with great unease at other developments in the fabrication sector, which is important in the north of Scotland. Hon. Members who regularly travel on the Gatwick to Inverness shuttle will notice that a large proportion of the people on the plane are commuting. They work in the oil and gas industry, and it is interesting that they are commuting north to work not in Scotland, but as far away as Sakhalin island. That is a sad indication that, although the industry has a future, much of it is struggling. The BBC reported this morning that the number of Scottish firms going into liquidation soared by more than 40 per cent. in the first three months of this year, which is deeply worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me touch on the contributions that have been made so far. The expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan in the oil industry was clear to everyone, which may explain the unease among Ministers, none of whom sought to intervene
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
on him. I note with interest—I am sorry that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) chose to ignore this point when he claimed that no SNP policy had been presented. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Gentleman chooses to read the record, he will see that he did say that in his contribution. He chose to disregard three sensible suggestions that would help the oil and gas industry and secure jobs: uplift for exploration; offset for fuel financing and relief for incremental investments. I hope that Labour Members will embrace those sensible suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in several of the points made by the Secretary of State. She said that there had been consultation on the Pilot project. That will be news to many in the industry, and perhaps in summing up, the Minister will say exactly who was involved. I also noted with interest that the Secretary of State said that the impact on jobs would be minimal. What is "minimal impact"? Is it 1,000, 5,000 or 10,000 jobs? Where is the assessment, and when will it be available in the Library for all hon. Members to read?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not think that that sort of fatuous argument is undermined by the fact that BP is slashing jobs throughout Scotland, although the barrel price is $27 and the company's profits have never been higher? That has nothing to do with marginal changes in the tax regime and everything to do with the demand for assets to be sweated at the expense of the labour of Scotland, and the hon. Gentleman did nothing about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who is a colleague of mine on the European Scrutiny Committee, was not present when my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan opened the debate for the SNP and covered those very points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would reply to the three points that he has not addressed. When will a job impact assessment be handed in to the House of Commons Library for everyone to read? Will the Minister tell the Committee about the involvement of the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive? What representations were made by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Scottish Executive and the Scotland Office on the issue? When did the Minister find out about the proposals on taxation for the North sea? Of course, I do not expect him to tell the Committee whether he supported those proposals before the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Savidge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I must allow the Minister time to reply to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the north of Scotland will be very interested to hear whether decision-making powers in the Department of Trade and Industry have shifted from Aberdeen to London. It would be a matter of grave concern that the key decision makers, who have been based in Aberdeen, may see greater advantages by following London's magnet for key decision-making powers. There is great unease in the north of Scotland and we need answers to all those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>12.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to respond to the debate. It is some time since I last replied to a Scottish Grand Committee debate, but as my hon. Friend the Minister of State is downstairs talking about the Scottish biotechnology industry, it fell to me to respond. This is new to me, and I have a whole new platoon of Private Frasers sitting opposite—"We're doomed, all doomed." Characteristically, we have not heard a word about the successes. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan actually hates successes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has not been a word about the development of the Clair field after more than 20 years, or about Goldeneye, with its pioneering tie-back technology, or the huge investment and 300 construction jobs at St. Fergus. There has been not a word about the Argyll field, or Ardmore, as it is now to be, a marvellous example of what innovative independence can do. There has been not a word about the huge progress made through Pilot in bringing Government and industry together, the new relationship with Norway, which is now more positive than at any time in the history of the North sea or the fallow fields initiative with its exciting opportunities for independence. We hear only the hopeful hypothesis that things will get worse in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan consisted of little more than briefings from oil companies on why they should pay less tax. Oil companies want to pay less tax—what a sensation! I shall share a secret with the hon. Gentleman: if oil companies paid 3 per cent. tax, it would complain about paying 4 per cent. tax, and the really sad thing is that the SNP and the Liberal Democrats would support them. I wonder how much consultation there has been between the hon. Gentleman and his erstwhile colleagues in the Scottish Parliament because, as a result of the Budget, there will be a cumulative total of £8.2 billion extra for the Scottish Executive by 2007–08. How will that be funded if not through taxation? If it is to be funded through taxation, why should oil companies be exempt when oil prices have doubled since the matter was last reviewed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I should like to dwell on the Norwegian point in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hood. Is it in order for a Minister to arrive late, miss part of the opening speech, and then refuse to give way to interventions that would enlighten him on the bits that he missed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is well aware that interventions are a matter for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some things never change. The bogus Banff and Buchan point of order is alive and well— and tedious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the North sea, Norway is the other side of the same coin. The SNP has droned on since time immemorial that we should be more like Norway, but I have never found it to be a conclusive argument. What is the equivalent tax rate in Norway? It is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
40 per cent., 50 per cent., 60 per cent., 70 per cent., or even 80 per cent., but somewhere around 85 to 88 per cent. Should we be more like Norway or not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine labours under a delusion if he thinks that Angola is different because the fuels are bigger. The figures compare like with like, and I am happy to supply them to the hon. Gentleman for his enlightenment. Tax take in most other countries is far higher than in the UK. The following figures are from IHS Energy Group consultants, and are based on a typical 100 million barrel oil field and on an oil price of $18 per barrel: Norway is 88 per cent.; US Gulf of Mexico is 66 per cent.; Canada is 70 per cent.; Angola is 80 per cent.; and Brazil is 65 per cent. The UK has gone up from 35 to 40 per cent. Those are comparative figures. If Liberal Democrat Members think that the UK tax regime is unreasonable, we must agree to disagree. There are no tricks in those figures; they compare like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that those figures are from before the Budget? Two countries have changed their tax regime upwards: Venezuela and Argentina. They are not great examples for the UK economy. Russia has cut its tax to attract more investment. The UK has increased its tax, which must alter the differential investment climate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is struggling. My point is that those figures compare like with like, so any response should do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to what the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan said about the licensing round, which he went out of his way to denigrate. It was a classic contribution from him because superficially he sounded authoritative and weighty. In fact, it was pure rubbish. His implication was that all previous licensing rounds had been great successes in relation to this one. That is simply untrue. In the latest licensing round, the 20th, the number of blocks initially applied for in the North sea represented about 13 per cent. of those offered. If, as the hon. Gentleman claimed, that is a disaster compared with the previous licensing round in the North sea, what must the figure have been for that round; 40 per cent., 50 per cent. or 60 per cent.? Not a bit of it. The answer is 10 per cent. It was lower than in this round, at the stage of initial applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why was there no press release? [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even at this advanced stage in his career, the hon. Gentleman must learn that some politicians do not live by press release alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that, for the first time ever, there was no DTI press release on the licensing round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the Committee the figures on exploration and appraisal drills. Does the Minister dispute that 112 wells were drilled in 1996 and only 51 last year? Will he shrug that off or accept it as a matter for concern? Will he now respond to the three positive suggestions that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
made, which, within the changes to the tax regime, could preserve jobs in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due respect, we must be careful with words. I have not brushed off the hon. Gentleman's argument about the licensing round, but exposed it as utterly fallacious. Everyone knows that there is less exploration going on because the North sea is a mature province and the opportunities are becoming fewer. That is why Pilot is seeking to maximise those opportunities and is working so hard in the fallow fields initiative. There is no surprise in those statistics; all we must do is work better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the argument that was made about affairs being moved from London, which was the exact opposite of the truth. When the Aberdeen office opened in 1994, 40 staff were located there. There are now 84 staff located there—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan not to interrupt the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everybody in the oil industry believes that there should be two locations for the DTI oil and gas directorate, because some functions are better carried out in Aberdeen and others in London. On the point about shifting the balance, one thing that I have done, and taken pride in, in this job has been to create an organisation called Renewables UK, which will serve the whole country, feed off the synergies with the oil and gas industry and, hopefully, create many thousands of jobs in the new renewables industry. Where is it located? Not in London, but in Aberdeen, as part of the oil and gas directorate. Again, there has been no mention of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving on to investment, Opposition Members did not mention everything else that was in the Budget. They did not mention the package on first-year allowances, which will potentially lead to increased, not decreased, investment in the North sea. They did not mention consultation or the abolition of royalties. As a whole, and as many people in the oil industry have said, the package is balanced and, for some companies—particularly the independents—it could be beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale about the fall in the BP share price. Again, that is selective information because although it did go down, it then went back up again and has now come down slightly. It is quite evident that what has affected the BP share price is not the Budget, but the fluctuating price of oil in world markets and the current instability there. I discussed that in Pamplona the other day, where I had a good conversation with Lord Browne. His view on that is much more balanced than some that we have heard today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the new developments taking place, hon. Members will be familiar with the importance of BP's Magnus enhanced oil recovery project in the northern North sea. Under that, gas from BP's Foinaven and Schiehallion fields west of Shetland will be pumped to the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetlands. I am delighted to say that that will result, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
the next 10 days, in gas from west of Shetland being brought ashore to Sullom Voe for power generation. That will be the first gas to come onshore from west of Shetland. This is the first stage of the project. It will provide a valuable new source of indigenous UK gas, which will be routed through Sullom Voe and it will deliver environmental benefits through being available for use in power generation. That is further evidence of the major infrastructural investments being made in the UK Continental Shelf under the Government's regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say something about the fabrication industry. Renewables UK feeds off the experience of the Offshore Supplies Office, which was established by a Labour Government in the 1970s when there was virtually no supply chain in the UK: unless the Government acted proactively, we would not obtain the manufacturing benefits of the North sea. The extraordinary success of the Offshore Supplies Office was achieved by raising the UK content in the hardware of the oil and gas industry to over 70 per cent. That is what I want to do with renewables too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot guarantee that every order will come to the UK, but we can ensure that our yards can compete, that they are aware of opportunities and that there is a level playing field. However, they must be competitive and able to win those orders, just as we would expect other countries to say that our companies can compete in their markets too—which they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a reasonable point that Governments cannot fix orders for companies, but can he give the people closely associated with the yard at Nigg an idea of the efforts that the Government are making to help them in the way that he has outlined to win contracts and stay in business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have worked closely with BP to ensure—for instance in the Clair field—that there is complete fairness in assessing bids and throughout the process. However, we cannot direct a company to place an order at a particular yard. I think that everybody understands that. The advice that I receive from my officials is that we are satisfied with the way in which BP is conducting the competition for the Clair orders. I have no doubt that a substantial proportion of the work relating to Clair will stay in the UK. I cannot say which yards will get the work, but I am sure that UK companies will win a substantial share of the work associated with Clair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, I believe that there is a good story to tell. I do not believe that the doom and gloom merchants will be right. When companies make investment decisions they must take into account a range of considerations. There is no doubt that it is a hugely competitive market for investment. Many provinces in the world offer major reserves that can be exploited more cheaply than the North sea, but the North sea also has the attractions of a mature province. People know what is there and how to exploit it and I believe that they will continue to invest in the way that was proposed. I do not see the downturn in this industry predicted by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
We must also ensure that we maintain the skills base in this industry. One problem that Pilot is also addressing is the ageing work force. We must send out messages that this is an attractive industry with good rewards and working conditions that have been transformed in recent years, and that it offers a long-term stable future to the young people coming into it. That in turn depends on ensuring that investment levels are maintained and new investments made. I assure the Committee that, through Pilot and our work with the industry, we shall continue to ensure that the climate exists to attract investment into the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, Central for his measured remarks and his intelligent approach to the Budget and the environment that it will create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members should stop looking for doom and gloom, and stop looking five, 10 or 15 years ahead to find bad news stories for which they cannot be held accountable. They should look at the present and the positive achievements that have been made in the North sea, and they should draw their conclusions accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Anniesland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have secured this debate on a matter of great importance to Scotland's economy, the jobs of Scottish people and our relations with the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will start by saying how Scotland is presently doing within the UK, and then move on to the important area of Scotland's economic relations with England, Northern Ireland and Wales, taking more than a passing interest in Europe and the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy has weathered the global storm following 11 September. I am glad to say that manufacturing output is up and that the service industries are forging ahead. Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the outlook for manufacturing and service industries. That prosperity is the direct result of the Chancellor's emphasis on creating a stable and robust economy. It is, however, also the result of Scotland's success in selling not only throughout Europe, but on its own doorstep in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend join me in welcoming both the freeze on whisky and, in particular, the stamps that have been put on it? That is good news for the export of whisky and for those among my constituents who work in distilleries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly good news for people who live in my constituency, which has a large whisky bond within its boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
We have to realise that we are dealing with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The most recent figures show that Scotland's biggest exports are construction and manufacturing. Some £10 billion of such exports go to the rest of the UK and more than £17 billion go to the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years, the UK has been seen from the United States as the gateway to Europe, and from Europe as the gateway to the United States. In more recent years, it has been seen as a gateway to both from the far east. For those reasons, the need for Scotland to work with other countries of the UK is self-evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many other areas, however, such as distributive trades, transport and communication and financial services, we do our best trade on our doorstep. We export £2.8 billion of transport and communication services to the UK, while importing around £1.5 billion. However, our trade with the rest of the world is considerably less than that; we export £5.7 million of such services while importing £8.3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major industry in my constituency is shipbuilding, and I know that my hon. Friends will excuse me if I use it as an example, just for a change. As I have often said, the Clyde was the name in world shipbuilding, but sadly that is no longer the case. Hopefully it will be again, but if the nationalist parties have their way, the industry will decline and eventually disappear. The SNP policy of NATO withdrawal and independence from the rest of the UK would be the last nail in the coffin of a once proud industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an independent Scotland, would we have a Scottish navy and Scottish shipbuilding? I think not. The only reason why we still have shipbuilding on the Clyde is thanks to Government and Ministry of Defence orders for ALSL ships, Type 45 destroyers and, hopefully, an aircraft carrier or two when next year's orders are placed. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will do his best to deliver that order to the Clyde and I plead with him to try to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no coincidence that the Scottish Nationalists have never won the Glasgow, Anniesland seat. The only time they came close was during the 1978 by-election when my predecessor, Donald Dewar, won an historic victory and changed the face of Scottish politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can wait until I have finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP has never recovered or learned the lesson of how important ships are to the Clyde, Anniesland and Garscadden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about parties not winning seats. He is aware that my constituency of Moray has a great defence interest, notably at RAF Lossiemouth. I was intrigued that the Labour party did not have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
candidate at the by-election and showed no commitment to the people of that town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in the debate when discrimination against whisky was mentioned, the hon. Gentleman suggested, from a sedentary position, that he wanted it to continue. I should be grateful if he agreed that he said that and say whether discrimination within the UK is appropriate at a time when the single market in Europe makes trade easier everywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak on my subject and not the hon. Gentleman's. My majority is much larger than his. I am sure that we shall get there eventually with candidates such as himself in that seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no coincidence that the Scottish Nationalists have never won the Anniesland seat, but it is important to say that there have been many successes. Our trade in financial services shows a similar picture. We export £1.8 billion to the UK while exporting £6.5 million to the rest of the world. Around 50 per cent. of Scotland's exports go to the rest of the UK and, on that basis, one third of Scotland's trade is with Europe. Furthermore, around 65 per cent. of Scotland's imports come from the rest of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish business and industry are tightly interlinked with the economy of the entire United Kingdom, which is good news for enterprise, jobs and the socially excluded in Scotland, because the best way out of social exclusion is, as all Labour Members know, a job. Scotland is competing increasingly in the global market and Europe. Almost one third of our exports go to the EU. That success depends on us having a strong home market and by that I mean the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
International companies have looked to Scotland when setting up a base in the United Kingdom. Standard Life, one of Scotland's largest employers said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Being a market leader means thinking globally."</p></blockquote>
Standard Life grew from a single office in Edinburgh in 1825 to have a strong presence throughout the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with offices in Europe, Asia and Canada. Furthermore, inward investment to Scotland is dependent on strong links with Europe, with more than 600 foreign-owned companies serving their European and global customers from bases in Scotland, including Compaq, NEC, IBM and Sun Microsystems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the nationalist parties—the Scottish National party and the Scottish Socialist party are closely linked—to claim that a separate Scotland would make no difference. If we lost those markets, I doubt that either party would last more than one election. They should expand on what independence would mean for Scotland. Would it mean isolation? Would it mean high tax? Would it mean high unemployment? I believe that that is exactly what would it would mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Westminster Hall recently, the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)he has left his seat— referred to how well the whisky industry was doing, but that it was being crippled by tax. However, when my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
had been five years of no increase in tax for the industry, all we got was the usual whingeing from Opposition Members. It is obvious to me, and probably to everyone else, that the SNP has no idea or real knowledge of what balancing a budget really means. SNP Members think that we can increase taxes here and there and do everything for everyone. It is good to see that the Liberal Democrats, who were so cosy with them earlier, have gone away for an early lunch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, the enormous gamble suggested by Opposition parties—one I hope that we will never take—would not pay off for Scottish workers, such as my own constituents in Glasgow, Anniesland. We must not forget that nearly 290,000 Scottish jobs depend on exports to the European Union. Jobs in my constituency and throughout Scotland are at risk while the argument for independence persists. The nationalists' renewed drive for independence and separating Scotland from its nearest natural trading partners would have a disastrous consequence. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing). This is obviously something that she does not want to hear. I would love to hear her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Annabelle Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that perhaps the hon. Gentleman has heard of the European single market, and therefore his comments on our market and future relations with our neighbours south of the border seem rather curious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention, which was up to her usual standard. If our natural partners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are not part of the equation, the partnership with Europe will sadly go down the drain, along with her own prospects in the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has a structural defect when the United Kingdom is in balance. It has a balance without oil of £4.9 million, according to GERS. Perhaps I had better mention what GERS means. In this case, it means the Government expenditure and revenue survey, and not the Scottish cup winners. I just thought that I would get that in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon. Member for Perth and her sidekick jump up and claim that Scotland runs an oil surplus, I should point out to them that that depends on the price of oil. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out that fact to them earlier. If the price is low, we cannot bank on that sort of money. It would be a fool who tried to balance a budget on money that they do not know they are going to get. It is an absolute disaster that the SNP has chosen to ignore that companies thrive in Scotland because of our ties with the rest of the UK and our gateway status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Tayside (Pete Wishart) has talked about 40 firms closing during the last year, and I felt that he had a point. Perhaps I can cheer him up and give him some good news. In the year 2000–01, Scotland attracted 101 new projects worth £463 million and created 13,000 jobs. North America provided 51 of those projects, but UK firms were responsible for 19, and European firms the other 19. That is good news, and I am sure that there is a lot more to come. In recent times, Rolls-Royce has
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
confirmed that its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Hillington will safeguard about 900 more jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to make one other comment about the whingeing that has gone on. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned it clearly, but Opposition Members were not listening. John Swinney—or was it Sweeney? I cannot remember—said that it was time to stop whingeing for Scotland. We have seen precious little of a response to that from the nationalists or, for that matter, from their cosy colleagues today, the Liberals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask whether companies would be coming to Scotland if Scotland were breaking away from the rest of the UK. The Scottish people will be voting next year on their future and, if Monday's opinion polls are correct, they will once again put a nail into the nationalists' coffin; a final nail, I hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Weir 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is too late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) was, yet again, too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (John Robertson), first, on securing this Adjournment debate, secondly, on his choice of subject and, thirdly—with some envy—on the success of his football team in the Scottish cup. I must say that, when I first saw the subject that he had chosen—Scottish trade with the rest of the UK—my mind went back to the shenanigans that surrounded the passage and implementation not of the Scotland Act, but of the Act of Union. I do not remember it personally, but I have been told about it. At a very late stage, English Members of Parliament attempted to impose duties on exports from Scotland and were foiled only by Queen Anne proroguing Parliament. That was an 18th century, rather than a 21st century, solution but very timely and effective nevertheless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have come a long way since then. As my hon. Friend said, the United Kingdom has become probably the world's most successful single market, benefiting from a completely level playing field. Traders based in any part of the United Kingdom may do business and win orders in the other parts. These days, the threat to that single market comes not from the little Englanders in this House but from the little Scotlanders of the Scottish National party. Scotland's trade and commerce, not only with England but with Wales and Northern Ireland, would be placed in jeopardy were the SNP to come to power—however unlikely that might be—and start breaking up Britain to achieve independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In jeopardy also would be tens of thousands of Scottish jobs and the prosperity in Scotland that this Government have striven to nurture, with such success. We had an excellent debate on the biotechnology industry in Westminster Hall, initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross). Not one of the five SNP Members was there.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Notwithstanding the fact that they were here in the Scottish Grand Committee, we had Liberal Democrat, Tory and Labour Members present in Westminster Hall. I wondered why the SNP was not there, but it became clear. We were talking about what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), a Liberal Democrat, called a great success story for Scotland and the United Kingdom. Success stories do not fit the SNP's agenda. Its members want to whinge and whine; they are doom and gloom merchants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The single market that I described has been perpetuated and consolidated in the constitutional revolution that our Government have brought about. It was not an accident that, when we set the parameters for devolution, the framework and regulation of the UK single market were firmly reserved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the single market in the UK is such a success, why is Scotland to be disadvantaged in the single market in the European Union? The hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland did not answer that. Scotland is a large market within the whole European Union, and will be cut off because of the Westminster connection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to that in the moment, but I can confirm that that was not a planted question. I did not speak to the hon. Gentleman in advance, and I shall deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did we reserve the single market? Not because we Scots cannot be trusted with those powers, or with any of the reserved areas. Many are being exercised by Scots down here in the United Kingdom Parliament. It is because the economy of this Untied Kingdom is indivisible; or, at least, not divisible without great damage. The decision was not taken lightly. Members will recall that the White Paper "Scotland's Parliament", which paved the way for devolution, was the result of a protracted and extensive process of consultation and debate; a process, incidentally, from which the SNP, typically, excluded itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the late Donald Dewar and the Government put the White Paper to the people of Scotland for their endorsement, it was a fundamental of the scheme that he recommended that the levers of the economy, and its regulation, remained functions of Westminster. Those functions include the macro-economy and its management, of course, but also taxation and benefits, financial services, most aspects of energy policy, protection in the workplace, legislation to protect the consumer, telecommunications policy and regulation. All those elements are required for the maintenance of a viable, vibrant economy, delivering for all the peoples of the United Kingdom. We are also delivering for people in need in other parts of the United Kingdom. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Member for Perth needs any advice on how to apply for an Adjournment debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy), who is an expert on the workings of the House, will advise her and she will not need to sit there squawking from a sedentary position. She will be able to get up on her hind legs and say a few barely coherent words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way in his usual courteous manner. He was saying how successful the Union with England has been for Scotland, but how can he possibly sustain his comments when growth in the Scottish economy in the last quarter was 0.1 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very good growth in comparison with growth in other European countries and with world growth. If the hon. Lady looks at more than one quarter, she will get a better perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much growth does my hon. Friend think we would have if there were an independent Scotland tomorrow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend knows the answer to that. It would be negative. However, I should press on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. As I say, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen can give advice on how to secure an Adjournment debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the single market in place, Scotland's trade with the rest of the UK has thrived. It has thrived also with the European Union—this is what my hon. Friend wants me to talk about—thanks to a larger, if looser, single market that increasingly dwarfs our own. Of the exports that Scotland sends beyond the United Kingdom, fully 63 per cent. go to other member states of the European Union; a success story if ever there was one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between Scotland and its partner territories things of the past, the Government are now striving to limit the impact of geography that has harmed Scotland in the past. That is why the Secretary of State for Scotland and I are working hard to secure more direct international flights between Scotland—all its airports, not just Prestwick—and Europe's main business centres. That is why the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive lobbied hard in Brussels to win approval for the new fast ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge, which will be so vital to Scotland's links with the rest of Europe. That is also why we are so pleased that the House will shortly be asked to devolve powers to the Scottish Executive for restarting the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry, so that a vital trade link for Kintyre has a chance of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Government are putting in place new building blocks for Scottish competitiveness in our single market, the SNP is campaigning to knock the foundations from beneath the entire edifice. It blethers on about independence in Europe, but it seems to have no more concept of why Europe is a success than why the United Kingdom is a success. It is surely no accident that the 15 member states of the EU are trying to make their own single market deeper and more comprehensive; they can see how effective and successful ours is and what a disadvantage it is to them, for example, to have 15 different regimes for financial services in Europe, when the four parts of the United Kingdom thrive through having just one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no accident either that countries throughout central and eastern Europe—as you know better than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
anyone, Mr. Hood—are queuing up to join the European Union and its single market, for they can see the benefits too. Hon. Members can take my word that, once those countries have joined, they too will push hard for the elimination of the remaining barriers to trade and commerce that are encountered in Europe, but not in the United Kingdom. Once again, the SNP just does not get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few months ago, the SNP dug itself into a hole— no new experience for that party, I must admit—by answering a question about what would happen if a newly independent Scotland were not automatically admitted immediately to the European Union. Its answer was that Scotland would then seek membership of the European Free Trade Area—the European economic area—and would sever its ties with England, Wales and Northern Ireland to form a far looser arrangement with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. I have done some research into what membership of that powerhouse would mean for the Scottish economy. Without disrespecting the present member states, the answer is not much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Membership of the EEA would make an independent Scotland subject to the rules of the EU single market but, not being a member of the EU, it would have no say in the formulation of such rules; a return to taxation without representation. Being outside the EU would also mean Scotland's exclusion from other vital areas of EU activity, such as co-operation on justice and home affairs, and the common foreign and security policy. The sole added benefit of joining EFTA would be a customs union with Switzerland, which refuses to have anything to do with the EU single market and retains its tariff barriers. What a consolation prize.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this makes independence for Scotland sound like a nightmare, and it certainly does not appeal to the bulk of the business community. There are always a few businessmen who have given up trying to squeeze their egos into the Kelvin hall and feel the need to be very big fish in a small pool. However, they want independence in the same sense that Dorothy-Grace Elder wants independence. They want it for themselves, not for Scotland. A few others in the business community are lured by the siren voices of Andrew Neil and fringe elements of the Scottish National party—an unholy alliance, if ever there was one—on to the rock of fiscal autonomy. They have been persuaded that key elements of the UK single market, such as control over taxes and revenues, can be dismantled without placing the political structure of the UK in jeopardy. Frankly, they have been taken in, because fiscal autonomy effectively means independence. There is no disguising it. As I have said before, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, there is a very good chance that it is a duck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, it is no surprise that the key players in Scottish business, commerce and manufacturing—including the oil and gas industry that the Committee discussed earlier—want Scotland's
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
trade with England, Wales and Northern Ireland to continue to enjoy the benefits of a vital single market. They are well aware of the investment decisions that have been taken to Scotland's benefit because of its role in the UK single market and the European single market. Indeed, they may have taken such investment decisions themselves because of those important markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bank of Scotland merged with the Halifax, the bulk of the merged organisation's headquarters activity was set up in Scotland. Now that global financial institutions are seeking to diversify from Wall street and the City of London in the wake of 11 September, what do we see? Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland visited last week, not only is thriving in Cumbernauld but is setting up back-office operations in Glasgow. Would they have come here if there were even the slightest barrier to cross-border commerce? Of course not. That is why the suggestions from some Opposition Members are so dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland must have the record not just for asking questions but for raising Adjournment debates in Westminster Hall and in the Scottish Grand Committee. He would not come top of some artificial list produced on an entirely false basis, but would be at the top of a list based on real work and on representing his constituency. He has done the House a service in choosing what must, on the face of it, have seemed a rather strange subject for the debate, and one that I suspect has not been debated in precisely this way in the House or in the Scottish Grand Committee before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has enabled me not only to highlight the benefits for Scotland of the UK's single market, but the flimsiness of the case for independence mounted by the SNP. It is clear from their frustration, annoyance, whining and whingeing that they recognise the flimsiness of their case. It is a case that we look forward to exposing regularly and ever more comprehensively as we approach the elections for the Scottish Parliament. I am glad to see that a poll by 	<i>The Herald</i>—it even put it on the front page—showed a huge increase in the Labour percentage over the SNP, not just for Westminster, but for Holyrood elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to point out that the poll also showed an increase in SNP representation in the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the polls are going in the right direction, and the SNP position will change soon as well.
