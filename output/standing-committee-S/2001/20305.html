Defence in Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr. Adam Ingram)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.<br><br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to open the debate on defence in Scotland in the Scottish Grand Committee. I last attended the Committee as a Back Bencher some time ago, as I have been engaged in ministerial business since 1997. It is good to be back and to see some new faces in the Labour party and in the Opposition. Many hon. Members here today have taken a keen interest in defence, and I look forward to their useful contributions.<br><br>
In recent years, and especially in recent months, defence has taken on a renewed significance. International events, not least in Afghanistan, have moved the role, purpose and activities of the armed forces up the political agenda, so that hardly a news bulletin does not mention defence or a defence-related issue. That is reflected in the attention that the House is now paying to such matters. Over the past six months, we have had 18 statements and debates, mainly on the fight against international terrorism. On 14 February, there was a major debate on defence policy in the House. Four more one-day debates are scheduled for this session, so hon. Members will have considerable scope to raise defence issues.<br><br>
However, my Scotland Office colleagues and I believe that we would all gain from a debate on the role of defence in Scotland, and on the role that Scotland plays in the defence of the United Kingdom. An aspect of our wider defence policy is worth mentioning again because of its importance and the fact that the Department is seeking opinions on it from around the country in quite a short time scale. We are undertaking work on a new chapter of the strategic defence review, which considers our defence posture, plans and capabilities after 11 September 2001. We must ensure that we have the forces to meet the additional challenges that we now face from international terrorism. We also want to hear the views of Scotland and other parts of the UK.<br><br>
We are not working on a new defence review, but on a new chapter to the 1998 strategic defence review. The SDR sought to modernise defence, better defend the UK's interests and contribute towards making the world a safer place, while making every pound that is spent on defence count. It placed particular emphasis on defence capabilities and systems that were—and are—relevant to the new strategic circumstances. Those capabilities include reconnaissance, surveillance, rapid deployment and precision strike. The UK was able to play such a significant role in military operations in the Balkans, Sierra Leone and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
Afghanistan in no small part because of the enhanced capabilities that the SDR delivered.<br><br>
However, the appalling events of 11 September highlighted the need to examine whether we have the right concepts, forces and capabilities to address the threat from international terrorism and the growing likelihood of asymmetric action against the UK and our wider interests. The outcome of the work will be vital to defence throughout the UK. The discussion document issued last month seeks comments from a wide audience on the use of our forces at home and overseas. It gives the people of Scotland an opportunity to influence the way in which we defend their interests and ours. I commend the SDR new chapter discussion document to all right hon. and hon. Members, and hope to have their input.<br><br>
Defence, as ever, is a necessity. The security provided by our armed forces is a vital service that is enjoyed by every citizen of the UK and beyond our shores. It should be clear that the defence of the UK is indivisible, although some would challenge that. The UK rightly has a single unitary defence policy and one set of armed forces to protect us and promote our interests and values at home and throughout the world.<br><br>
The UK is a major contributor on the international stage, and Scotland makes a considerable contribution to that role. The sum of the parts adds up to much more than Scotland could ever deliver on its own as a separate nation outside NATO, as some want it to be.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the many roles played by members of the UK armed forces from Scotland in recent operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and elsewhere. In short, Scots have played a major international role as a force for good, working alongside their countrymen and women from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<br><br>
With the new political settlement and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and the devolved Administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland, the landscape has changed. Defence of the UK remains a reserved matter, which few would dispute, but the devolved Administration has an important role to play in delivering on defence. Against that scenario, I would be interested to hear about the nationalists' vision of a separate Scotland, out of NATO and as a bit-part player in world events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take the opportunity to set out his defence policy, because that is part of the purpose of the debate. I do not expect him to do that in an intervention, but I tried to access the nationalists' defence policy on the internet and found nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister described the role of countries that are non-nuclear and not part of NATO as "bit-part". Would he describe the role of neighbouring countries such as Sweden, Finland, Austria and Ireland as "bit-part"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention those countries</span>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would you?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not speak from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention those countries because we have good bilateral arrangements with them. Most countries in and around Europe and those that seek entry to the European Union and NATO—I understand that an independent Scotland under the Scottish National party would not seek that—are trying to play a significant role. Whether through NATO or a coalition of the willing, nations can make a major contribution. We spend a great deal of time on our bilateral relationships and have good working relationships with all those countries.<br><br>
It is difficult to discover precisely what the party represented by the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) wants Scotland to be as an independent nation. What posture would it adopt? Where would it stand in relation to NATO and on European security and defence policy? How does the SNP envisage that policy integrating into the NATO framework? There is a vacuum of information, but perhaps there will be an opportunity to touch on some of those questions in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Roy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell and Wishaw)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend the Minister believe that, at a time when small countries such as Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia—which are all the same size as Scotland or smaller—are trying to become NATO members, the Scottish National party would take us out of it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question in the ongoing debate. We have said that any country seeking to become involved with NATO must consider not only its military input, but what the totality of the country represents and, importantly, its capabilities. NATO is examining all its structures to ensure that it is best placed to meet existing and emerging threats. Any nation aspiring to join NATO must address those issues. It is about bringing quality to the table. It is interesting that those nations are actively seeking membership, while a party representing Scotland clearly says that it does not want to be part of NATO. We may get more on that later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an SNP split.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my right hon. Friend says. The party probably splits five ways. If all its Members speak in the debate, we will probably hear the five pearls of wisdom that they have all written on the back of a fag packet.<br><br>
Since the dreadful events of 11 September we have been liaising closely with the Scottish authorities on issues relating to home security and defence. More generally though, we need to ensure that issues of concern to the armed forces, their families and veterans are tackled effectively by the devolved Administration, where they have prime responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government re-examine the role that the Territorial Army can play in any aspect of home defence and the SDR new chapter, especially
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
in ensuring the adequate recruitment of service men, who play such a vital role for Scotland abroad?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be kind to the hon. Gentleman. He may not have read the new chapter and seen the questions posed in it. The answer is yes. One of the issues that we must address is the role played by the TA and the reserve forces and how they can best be placed to improve, if required, homeland security. All those issues are vital. The hon. Gentleman should read the document and examine the questions and issues raised in it and then, hopefully, give us the benefit of his views. The SDR took into account the relationship with the reserve territorial strength and considered how it could sit alongside and, by various means, support the regular forces.<br><br>
Defence has always had a considerable footprint in Scotland. Contrary to claims by the SNP—the only party to make those claims—Scotland already receives a good deal from defence and gives a good deal in return. Many of our key facilities and assets are based in Scotland. The Ministry of Defence has 374 sites in Scotland extending to nearly 25,000 hectares. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has set out, our policy is to achieve a better balance of activity across the UK. That will mean a further broadening of the defence footprint, including in Scotland. As it stands, the land and buildings that we already own in Scotland are a clear demonstration of our long-term investment in Scotland and are worth some £1.3 billion in cash terms alone. Hon Members will be familiar with sites in their constituencies and I encourage them to engage fully with such units.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for raising the issue about potential sites in constituencies. Could I raise a general point about potential sites in the west highlands? He will be aware of project ISOLUS—Interim Storage of Laid-up Submarines—which talks about the future of decommissioned nuclear submarines. Would he agree that it would be crazy, simplistic and unwise for the project to extend to the west highlands as the SNP suggested during the general election?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recollect the letter that I wrote to him on 13 August 2001. In hindsight it might have been better if that been placed in the Library. Clearly there are scare stories about what may happen in Loch Ewe and the surrounding area. I explained in the letter that no proposals have been put to me or my ministerial colleagues to suggest that we should break up and store decommissioned submarines at Loch Ewe or anywhere else in the western highlands. Clearly it would be inappropriate to rule out any site in the United Kingdom until we have received proposals from industry, but I can assure my hon. Friend that neither Loch Ewe nor the western highlands generally is under consideration. An existing nuclear site is the most likely option, but it is only a likelihood at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of nuclear submarines and as a test of unity on the issue, will the Minister remind us of the result of the previous ballot of the Scottish Labour party on Trident? What was the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
majority, what was the vote either way and at which conference did the vote take place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak for the Government—[<i>Interruption</i>.] SNP Members ask a question and then start shouting before I have said two words. The hon. Gentleman obviously already knows the answer. If he had included that in his preamble, we might have had a debate about where he is coming from. I will touch on the Government's position on nuclear defence posture, which is important in view of what the Scottish National party is saying about the future of thousands of jobs on the Clyde. All those jobs could be put at risk, not just on account of nuclear defence but the nuclear industry as a whole. Some Members would close down the sites tomorrow if they could and put thousands of jobs at risk. [<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will hon. Members please maintain order for the benefit of those who are speaking in Committee? If they do so, they will later have an opportunity to make their own contributions to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear not, because some hon. Members—certainly those in the Scottish National party—are present just to ask questions, not to make contributions.<br><br>
I should like to touch on Scotland as the home of the nuclear deterrent. Our four Trident submarines are the ultimate guarantee of our security, and a squadron of nuclear attack submarines and many mine-hunter craft are also based at Faslane. Several major Army units are based in Scotland. The traditions and links between these regiments and the areas in which they are located are among the oldest and strongest in the United Kingdom, if not the world. The 1st battalion, the Royal Highland Fusiliers is based at Fort George in Inverness; the 1st battalion, the Highland Regiment is in Edinburgh; and, next month, the Royal Scots will move to Dreghorn barracks in Edinburgh. That will be the first instance for some time that three of the six Scottish regiments are based in Scotland.<br><br>
Scottish regiments also serve throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland and are regularly based further afield. The first battalion of the Black Watch has recently enjoyed a successful tour in Kosovo and the 1st battalion, the Highlanders is currently serving in Kosovo. Furthermore, 45 Commando, based at Arbroath, is currently deployed in support of operations against international terrorism, and the Royal Marines from Faslane are supporting the fleet in the Gulf.<br><br>
We are in the process of restructuring to ensure that our forces in Scotland provide greater benefit both to Scotland and to UK defence as a whole. Hon. Members have been informed that the 51st Highland Brigade is being expanded and will be renamed the 51st (Scottish) Brigade. It will be based at Forthside in Stirling and will be responsible for all TA soldiers—of which eight battalions are in Scotland—and cadets, as well as providing administrative support to all regular Army units and training organisations located in Scotland. The 52 Lowland Brigade will be re-roled as a Light Brigade, and renamed 52 (Infantry) Brigade, continuing to be based at Edinburgh.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
We also have a number of important RAF bases in Scotland, including Kinloss, which will continue to be the home of our Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft, and Leuchars and Lossiemouth, home of our Tornado F3 and Tornado GR4 aircraft. On current plans, Eurofighter—also known as Typhoon—will replace the Tornados at Leuchars. Royal Navy and RAF search and rescue helicopters are based at Prestwick and Lossiemouth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman intends to make a contribution to the debate, so I will not take any more interventions from him. Let him present his arguments in his contribution and I shall hear what he has to say then.<br><br>
All those sites are important to our role and mission, but also to their local economies. The Royal Navy submarine base at Faslane, for example, is one of the largest single-site employers in Scotland, employing over 15 per cent, of the local economically active population. RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Kinloss are not far behind, employing almost 10 per cent, of the working people in their areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hood. If I heard the Minister correctly, he seems to be introducing a new rule of order to Grand Committee debates; that visiting Ministers do not take interventions from hon. Members who are about to make contributions. However, it is in your hands, Mr. Hood, to determine who will make contributions. How can the Minister possibly know that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What interventions the Minister takes is a matter for him and not for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referred to as being a "visiting Minister". The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) occasionally visits Parliament; compared with his, my voting record is good. In this parliamentary session, I suspect that he has been a bit more hyperactive because of his party's appalling voting record in the previous Parliament. Whether his hon. Friend the Member for Moray is called is a matter for you, Mr. Hood, but it is a matter for me whether I accept interventions.<br><br>
The Ministry of Defence has a considerable civilian presence in Scotland, performing a wide range of functions. For example, the Defence Aviation Repair Agency site at Almondbank employs well over 300, and the Army personnel centre in Glasgow employs more than 1,000. The defence munitions sites at Beith and Crombie together employ about 800. In addition, Scotland provides some of our most important military training facilities for low-flying training and other activities—at Cape Wrath, for example—that contribute directly to our operational capabilities.<br><br>
Scotland remains a good source of recruits for the services, with manning levels in Scottish regiments among the highest in the Army. In 2001–02, about 2,500 officers and other ranks were enlisted by Scottish recruitment offices, more than 15 per cent, of the total. We are still surveying the armed forces as part of the 2001 census, and figures for all three services are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
available. However, I can tell the Committee that nearly 12 per cent, of the Army have classified themselves as being of Scottish nationality. That does not include those Scots who might have given their nationality as British. Scotland makes a major contribution to our non-Regular forces. There are 60 reserve units with more than 4,600 volunteers, and 230 cadet detachments with 9,500 members in Scotland.<br><br>
In total, nearly 25,000 MOD personnel work in Scotland in 27 of the 32 unitary authorities. They include more than 15,000 military personnel from all three services, and more than 9,500 civilians. In total, nearly 10 per cent, of MOD people working within the United Kingdom do so in Scotland. Those figures have risen in the past few years despite an overall fall in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. In addition, about 6,000 Scottish jobs are directly dependent on defence equipment expenditure. Most of those are skilled jobs, with pay rates above the Scottish national average.<br><br>
That is just the direct employment; a significant number of jobs are supported by the defence presence in Scotland. Multiplier methodology suggests that at least an additional 15,000 jobs are supported through induced and indirect effects of MOD employment in Scotland. If those jobs are added up, the total defence-related employment in Scotland is almost 46,000, which means that nearly one in fifty economically active people in Scotland is supported by the MOD presence there. That is more than five times the number of people directly employed in the Scottish whisky industry, double the number of people involved in the extraction of crude petroleum and gas, more than the number employed by banks and building societies or the electronics industry in Scotland and double the number of jobs that another large employer, British Telecom, claims to support in Scotland.<br><br>
On defence procurement, the spend on equipment is a major element of the Scottish economy. MOD payments directly to Scottish companies are worth about £600 million per year. That is important business, and supports many key industries, not least shipbuilding on the Clyde. Nearly 2,400 contracts have been awarded directly with prime contractors in Scotland during the past three years. I am pleased to say that the value of new contracts for equipment placed with Scottish primes has been rising year on year, from £207 million in 1998–1999 to £248 million in 2000–2001. The figure of £600 million a year includes only payments made directly to Scottish firms; it does not capture the highly significant value of work for Scottish companies from sub-contracting to companies based elsewhere in the UK. The exact value of the work is hard to capture, but it is considerable.<br><br>
During 2000–2001 the MOD placed contracts with 296 different companies based in Scotland. That is a testimony to the strength of the Scottish industry and the skills and hard work of the Scottish work force. Familiar names such as BAE Systems Avionics, Babcock Rosyth Defence and Rolls-Royce continue

to win important and valuable contracts. Last August I had the pleasure of signing a contract worth £230 million with Thales Optronics at its Glasgow factory. It is not just the largest firms that are getting the work; a long list of small and medium-sized companies benefit from the defence spend in Scotland.<br><br>
I shall briefly address the issue of shipping. A key area of defence spend is in the UK shipbuilding industry. We have embarked on the largest warship-building programme since the second world war and we have plans for up to 30 warships to be built in the UK over the next 15 to 20 years. On 18 February, my noble Friend Lord Bach announced a doubling of our order for type 45 destroyers in a £2 billion deal with BAE Systems Marine, based on the Clyde. That announcement saw our commitment rise from three to six ships in a planned class of up to 12 ships, safeguarding 1,200 jobs on the Clyde. As a result of the order, BAE Systems Marine has invested £75 million to bring a steel centre of excellence to the Clyde.<br><br>
In November last year, a contract worth £120 million was placed for the building of two alternative landing ships logistics at Govan. Work on the type 45s and the ALSLs, together with the recent award of the landing craft utility contract, will continue to support the Scottish economy well into the future. As well as being the clearest indication of the Government's commitment to a modern and powerful Royal Navy, that represents a huge opportunity for British industry and especially for industry in Scotland. The future carrier programme is still in its assessment phase and it represents a huge opportunity. It is now up to the companies to make the best offer. The MOD order book alone cannot sustain the UK shipbuilding industry but we are playing a part in that. It is not an exaggeration to say that without those orders, the future of shipbuilding in the Clyde would have been bleak.<br><br>
I shall address the subject of defence expenditure, on which there has been some debate outside the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The other way in which defence impacts on local economy is through Ministry decisions to move from a base, leaving it in civilian hands. In relation to the offloading of such property, would the Minister and his colleagues consider carrying out a quality assessment of those who take over the housing stock before selling it on to the public to ensure that a bad taste is not left in the mouth of the community from the loss of the defence base?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not have direct responsibility for the defence estates, one lesson that I have learned is about the careful way in which the Department handles a range of changes in terms of defence estate activity and the effect on local employment if there is a downsizing as a consequence of closure or redefinition. Change has to happen. I know that the hon. Gentleman would accept that matters cannot stand still. I take on board what he is saying. If he has an example of a situation that has not been well handled, I would be grateful if he could write to me and I will make sure that we get a detailed answer to him.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Carmichael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, I commend the Ministry on its dealings in regard to the drawdown of the RAF Saxa Vord that was announced in my constituency. The manner in which it dealt with the consultation on housing at Setters Hill is a model of how operations should be carried out. However, there is still concern in the community that we do not yet have a final decision on what will happen with the housing stock. The management of stock at Setters Hill and Unst is of prime importance to the economic future of that island. Can the Minister tell us when we can expect a final decision in order that the community can look to the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman off the top of my head when he will get a final decision but I know a man—or maybe a lady—who can. I take note of what he said. I am grateful for his comment about the way in which the matters have been handled. That reaffirms my point about how we assess the way in which we try to handle them. We are improving all the time and are learning lessons from previous experiences. If problems remain, the hon. Gentleman may ask me a question in Committee or write to me. I will try to give him an answer.<br><br>
The breadth of defence in Scotland is clear. However, I must address the tired allegations that Scotland is not getting a fair deal in defence, and that the Scottish people are receiving less than their fair share of defence expenditure and are therefore subsidising the rest of the United Kingdom. I return to my point about the indivisible nature of defence. Defence does not benefit some members of the United Kingdom more than others. It is there to protect and provide security to us all, wherever we may be. It is not like health or education where spending on a hospital or a school largely benefits a local area. Defence spending benefits the whole of the United Kingdom wherever it occurs, from RAF Culdrose in Cornwall to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. It does not differentiate on the basis of some narrow nationalistic creed.<br><br>
I hope that I have made it clear that Scotland makes its proportionate contribution to defence and benefits from the indivisible security that we all enjoy. However, there has been some debate about figures. I will set out the reality in the interests of ensuring that the debate is informed, rather than pick misleading figures to make political points, which is the current practice. Approximately £1.4 billion of defence expenditure goes directly to Scotland, £600 million of which is paid directly to contractors in Scotland for defence procurement, spare parts, goods and other services. The remainder—£818 million—is paid in salaries and wages to people in Scotland. That is before taking into account the pensions that are paid to veterans or their families.<br><br>
The figure of £1.4 billion is a conservative estimate. It does not include such items as sub-contracted work, rent, and local base spending, or the wider economic contribution that defence makes in Scotland. As I mentioned earlier, MOD procurement expenditure supports 21,000 defence-related jobs and brings approximately £380 million more into Scotland. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
is not included in the total estimate of £1.4 billion. If it was, it could be argued that defence is worth nearly £1.8 billion to the Scottish economy, which errs on the conservative side. As direct expenditure is some £1.4 billion and the minimum total economic contribution is £1.8 billion, I hope that it is clear to those who argue differently that Scotland receives a good and equitable share from the national pot.<br><br>
Defence should not be reduced to calculations on the back of a fag packet to suit a political point, which the SNP did recently. Scotland benefits from a high level of protection and security, and contributes internationally as a major force for good. The UK punches well above its weight and Scotland plays a significant part in that. That is a good deal for everyone in Scotland, by any standards.<br><br>
I have dwelt on the strategic and macro level of defence and its impact in Scotland. Defence is also an integral part of the communities that it is there to protect. Hon. Members would agree that defence largely has an extremely beneficial role in their communities. I could provide a litany of all the ways in which the defence community works directly and indirectly with the local community, and I add my support to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be aware that, last month, the Scottish Grand Committee had an excellent debate on the future of renewable energy. A point was made about the MOD's unhelpful role in planning applications for wind farms. Will the Minister tell us whether that matter is under review, and whether we can expect the MOD to have a more helpful approach?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that the Ministry is unhelpful. It is trying to do what it must to protect a range of interests. The Government wants a roll-out of wind farms. There is a major planning application for a wind farm in my constituency and, although I shall not go into the technical details, wind farms can affect air traffic control. If a wind farm were located beside a civilian airport, that objection could be made.<br><br>
The country's security should rank extremely high, if not uppermost, in the list of considerations to be taken into account. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not like it if a wind farm were established without the MOD's having examined it, and a plane came out of the sky as a consequence. He would then ask why we had not examined all the details. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point and we try to be helpful in these matters, but we must take all considerations into account.<br><br>
We are trying to balance a number of strategies and approaches. We will do our best to ensure that we deliver on that part of Government policy that is designed to take forward the renewable energy strategy, particularly on wind farms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of the objections of which I am aware related not to air traffic control, but to low-flying exercises. I have never quite understood the basis of those objections. As was said last month in Committee, there must come a time when low-flying exercises will be carried out over other areas and other countries that have wind farms. The point was made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
that Denmark would surely be safe from attack by low-flying aircraft from this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingrain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Denmark would be safe from attack by low-flying aircraft from this country; our relationship is on a good footing. My constituency of East Kilbride has a long established relationship with the town of Ballerup, which is just outside Copenhagen. I know of no plans that would put Denmark at risk—I like to put people's minds at rest occasionally—unless the hon. Gentleman knows something that I do not.<br><br>
There are technical aspects to low-flying areas. We must train pilots in low-flying activity or their capabilities and competencies can degrade. We need to continue to do that, which is why we must have matching between the requests that are made. I cannot give the figures off the top of my head, but some applications have been accepted and a considerable number have been objected to or are in that process. These tend to be small-scale planning applications, not large-scale wind farms. If the hon. Gentleman writes to me about specific concerns, I will address them.<br><br>
I have set out what Scotland does for defence and what defence does for Scotland, but could Scotland do more? Scottish industry is proud to make an important contribution to defence, but for contracts to continue to be won for Scotland, and for work to be undertaken in Scotland, industry must ensure that it is well placed to win the business. There is no fatted calf in defence any more and no spoils left to be divided, but there remains a considerable quantity of high-quality work to be won from defence, and jobs to be sustained and created. I challenge Scottish-based companies to continue to do their utmost to be competitive and to win that business. There are tremendous opportunities, and it is up to them to win the orders.<br><br>
Scotland is proud to host a considerable part of the defence establishment, from RAF bases and barracks to offices and exercise areas. I have set out the considerable benefit to be gained by local economies and in the direct employment from the basing of defence facilities. I commend those hon. Members who support defence establishments and I urge them to continue to show support. I have talked about the importance of defence establishments for local communities and the way in which Members can help that relationship.<br><br>
Scottish people are proud to serve in the UK armed forces and the supporting defence establishments. Scottish service personnel have always been known for their gallantry and dedication to duty in defending their fellow citizens. The best way to ensure that those proud traditions are honoured and continue is for defence as a whole to continue to thrive in Scotland, as an integral part of defence in the UK.</span></p>
<p>11.9 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Fife)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Hood, and to the Committee. I have to be absent for a period this morning, but I will try to ensure that it is as short as possible. It is a great privilege to debate defence in the Scottish Grand Committee and the first opportunity to do so in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
years that I have been a member of the Committee. I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I suggest that the choice of subject is not entirely altruistic. As his contribution developed, it seemed that he was demonstrating aggressive defence, something that was sadly lacking at Lansdowne road. If we have it today, it is perhaps better late than never.<br><br>
Aggressive defence has been a political weapon in this House before. Between 1987 and 1992, we seemed to debate nuclear weapons policy virtually every Friday for a period of six months. Official Labour party policy at the time was not to build the fourth Trident submarine. The Conservatives sought, as far as they could, to embarrass the Labour party and so we debated defence each week. It gave rise to a number of innovative responses. Now that the Minister knows so much about defence, he will be surprised to learn that one solution proffered by one of his hon. Friends was that the fourth submarine could be built, which would placate the people in Barrow-in-Furness. However, rather than it being armed with Trident missiles, it might become the world's first underwater oil tanker. The Labour party did not have the opportunity to form the Government in 1992 and the fourth submarine was built. Now we have four Trident submarines.<br><br>
One should not allow reference to the Trident submarines to pass without recalling the fallacious nature of the decision made by the previous Conservative Government to transfer Trident refitting from Rosyth to Devonport. As events have now proved, that decision was wholly unjustified on technical terms. I do not believe that it can be reversed. It is a continuing drain upon the defence budget. Substantial additional works will be required at Devonport and a final nuclear safety certificate has not yet been issued. Nuclear safety certificates may have to be issued almost on a weekly or monthly basis. That is a direct consequence of a decision taken by Conservative Ministers to try to shore up—quite unsuccessfully as it turned out—their support in the west country at the expense of Scotland. The dock, RD77, still sits at Rosyth, able—if the decision had been the right one—to deal with the refitting of Trident submarines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rachel Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman. Does he agree that what we predicted at the time in technical and cost terms has come about, and that it was clearly a decision made in the narrow political interests of the Conservative Government of the day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady, who has taken a keen, long-term interest in those matters, is absolutely right. Perhaps she and I can take some consolation; not only did the decision have no effect on the west country, the people in Scotland who were party to the decision are no longer Members of the House.<br><br>
The Minister's speech made it clear that, to some extent, the debate is not only about the Government's policies but those of other parties. Broadly speaking we support the Government's policy on defence. We supported the strategic defence review and its conclusions, which are based on the expeditionary strategy. As the Minister rightly acknowledged, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
publication of the new chapter tells us that that expeditionary strategy may need some revisiting and some revising in the light of the events of 11 September.<br><br>
Central to an expeditionary strategy are the aircraft carriers to which he referred and the aircraft that go on those carriers. The successful implementation of the carrier programme and the joint-strike fighter programme is, in my judgment—and, I suspect, in the Minister's, too—absolutely central to a credible expeditionary strategy. I am glad that he confirmed the position on the carriers. Perhaps he will confirm later the position on the joint strike fighter.<br><br>
Like the Minister, I always seek out information. I cannot master the technicalities, so I asked staff in my office if they would attack the website and tell me what was in the 2001 Scottish National party manifesto on defence. The Minister went out of his way to be kind to my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith); I shall go out of my way to be kind to the Scottish National party. The references to defence in the SNP manifesto for last year were exiguous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the information is classified and we will not be told what it is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there is some Swinney form of the Official Secrets Act to which we have not been admitted.<br><br>
An interesting fact that has already featured in our discussion is that 10 countries will apply to join NATO at Prague in November. All the indications are that at least seven of those countries will be admitted and that others will be disappointed at not being admitted. NATO is evolving; not to the point at which Russia will become a member, but at which NATO will be, to use the jargon, NATO at 20. Russia will be in the room; it will be sitting round the table, participating in discussions and helping to make the decisions. It will not have a vote but will be a part of that extraordinarily successful security organisation. It seems extraordinary that while Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania and so on all want to be part of that security organisation, one party thinks that the best interests of a fully independent Scotland would not be served by being a member of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coatbridge and Chryston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expect that with his tremendous expertise on those matters, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will refer to applications for the European Union. I think that he will agree that we are heavily dependent on Turkey, particularly in terms of aircraft and airspace. Given Turkey's failure to co-operate, for example, in providing visas for hon. Members to visit Kurdistan, and in terms of its humanitarian record, does he not share my concern that we should get those matters right before thinking about getting too close to it around the table?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has to admire the right hon. Gentleman's ingenuity. Turkey is a member of NATO and we already sit round that table with it. If he is saying that we should not admit Turkey to the European Union until we are satisfied with the standards that it applies to human rights and the extent to which civil society is allowed to operate, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
agree with him entirely. We may differ, in that while I want Turkey to be in the European Union, I want it to be admitted only after having taken the necessary steps to bring attitudes towards civil rights up to our standard. There is no advantage in trying to exclude Turkey. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that in Afghanistan, British forces are in command of ISAF, the stability force. We have placed a limited time limit on our involvement in that responsibility and we are hoping that the Turkish Government will take it up afterwards. We have many common interests with Turkey. While I accept that he is right to point to the particular instance that he has given, we should not allow that to make us erect barriers to a Turkey that meets the necessary standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Lady in a moment, if she would show a little more patience.<br><br>
No country has ever left NATO. The French have left the integrated military command, but not NATO, so when the Gulf war broke out, they were familiar with NATO's doctrines and procedures and were able to take part in operations. It was an American-led operation—a coalition of the willing—based essentially on the common understanding that NATO creates.<br><br>
It may be the policy of the Scottish National party to encourage greater involvement in the European security and defence policy rather than in NATO. That is an interesting alternative, but we should remember that the European security and defence policy can operate only through NATO. Only through access to NATO equipment does the European policy have any credibility. When the right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke) mentioned Turkey, I thought that he would refer to the obstructive approach that it adopted until a few months ago on the question of EU countries having access to NATO equipment. Its stance has changed, which shows that Turkey is willing to be more co-operative.<br><br>
On fundamental features of defence such as heavy lift and intelligence, the European security and defence policy and European rapid reaction force have to rely exclusively on NATO assets. Operational planning will also be done through NATO. If it were down to me, so would strategic planning. Those who advocate taking a European rather than a NATO position are really adopting a NATO position by the back door. They should reflect on whether outright opposition to NATO membership is justified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned that many applicant countries to the European Union are also seeking to join NATO. However, he will be aware that four current EU member states—Austria, Sweden, Finland and Ireland—are not members of NATO. Following his comments to their logical conclusion, is he saying that the international defence positions of those four member states are defective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If any illogical conclusion has been made, it follows from the terms of that question. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0479">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Irish, Swedes and others may choose not to be part of NATO, but I cannot understand a political party that argues in favour of the European security and defence policy when it is self-evident that such a policy depends in its entirety on the existence of a powerful and effective NATO. ESDP and NATO have an umbilical link, which the Scottish National party does not properly understand.<br><br>
Scottish forces would be confined to the Petersberg tasks; humanitarian relief, peacekeeping and no ability to fight high-intensity warfare. Scottish regiments would be the equivalent—it is a pejorative word, but appropriate for the circumstances—to a gendarmerie, similar to those of the Irish Republic. If that sort of defence role is desired, by all means say so and we can debate it, but please do not pretend that configuring armed forces in that way will allow them to retain the same capability and influence that Britain's armed forces currently have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I heard the right hon. and learned Gentleman correctly, he acknowledged that "gendarmerie" is a pejorative term. He described Ireland's defence posture—Ireland has a long record in UN peacekeeping operations, serving under the beret with great distinction—as equivalent to a gendarmerie. Will he reflect further on that? Is that the right policy for the Liberal party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy, for the hon. Gentleman's benefit, to confirm that it is. I have a question for him to reflect on; every time a vessel originating from an Irish port finds itself in difficulty in the Irish sea, from which country are search and rescue operations mounted? As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, the Irish—like the Canadians—have a long history of involvement in UN peacekeeping operations, but peacekeeping is a long way from peace enforcement and from the high-intensity conflict of which Britain's armed forces are capable. I am committed to the retention of the high-intensity warfare capability because it brings political influence.<br><br>
The Minister rightly referred to the relationship between bases and their surrounding communities. Another 500 civilian and military personnel will shortly be introduced at RAF Leuchars in my constituency, where there are two existing squadrons of the Tornado F3; there will be two squadrons of the Typhoon and the operational conversion unit for the Tornado. The relationship between the surrounding community and the station is extremely close, as it is at Kinloss, Lossiemouth, Faslane and other places. The service makes an invaluable contribution to charities and to the life of the community. The modern armed forces take that responsibility just as acutely as their responsibility to defend the realm.<br><br>
Defence in Scotland cannot be immune to the budgetary pressures to which defence in the United Kingdom is subject. For the first time in my recollection, the Secretary of State has been forthright in admitting that we are in a position, if not of overstretch, of considerable stretch. We must carefully consider budgets. Since 11 September, there has been a huge amount of discussion about the need
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
to invest in health and education and the necessity of raising taxation if necessary. However, there has not been much discussion about the need to invest in the most significant public service of all: a Government's obligation to maintain the security and safety of their citizens. I hope that the terms of the debate will change; I do not exempt my party from criticism in the matter. In the last general election, even the Liberal Democrats did not want to put a penny on income tax for defence budget purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a decision far above my pay grade, as the Minister knows. I am a humble foot soldier in Captain Kennedy's army.<br><br>
As the Minister said, some 6,000 jobs are directly dependent on defence equipment expenditure. Although none is located in North-East Fife, many are located in Glenrothes and other parts of the central belt; they make an enormous contribution, not least because of the skills that they engender and their capacity to attract and keep people with high-level skills.<br><br>
In the financial year 1999–2000, some 7 per cent, of total expenditure on defence equipment was spent in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will not think me churlish for saying that that figure is disappointing; perhaps the Secretary of State for Scotland will do more to increase that figure, as the skills are available to do so, especially in the central belt.<br><br>
The figures may be disappointing because they do not represent a precise proportion of United Kingdom expenditure, but they are ammunition—I hope I will be forgiven the pun—against those who seek willy-nilly to change the Barnett formula. They underline the fact that in public expenditure, it is not sufficient simply to take a crude measurement; one must look at all the indices of public expenditure to determine whether Scotland is getting a fair deal.<br><br>
The Minister will be aware of the problem of recruitment in the Scottish regiments. As at December 2000—the figures may be better now—the Royal Scots were 17 per cent, and Scotland's only cavalry regiment, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, was 15 per cent, under establishment. The Black Watch, which recruits in my constituency, was 13 per cent, under establishment. As a consequence, the Ministry of Defence employed a private recruitment company in a one-year trial from April 2001 to April 2002. It may be too early for the Minister to draw any conclusions from that trial, but I hope that, in due course, he will be able to tell hon. Members whether that approach, which I support, was successful. There is no point in having regiments with great traditions if they cannot be manned to carry out the tasks that they may be called upon to do.<br><br>
The Minister said that Scotland's contribution to United Kingdom defence was significant. He referred in passing to the four Vanguard submarines at Faslane, which are the UK's only nuclear capability.<br><br>
It is worth reminding those who are opposed to the nuclear deterrent and who think that we have not done enough to disarm that, since 1987, the UK has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
abandoned nuclear artillery shells and nuclear depth charges. It has also abandoned the WE 177 free-fall bomb earlier than planned, for which we should congratulate the Government. The previous Government abandoned the tactical air-to-surface missile, which had a nuclear warhead and was designed for the cold war. The UK has a proud and laudable record in the march towards multilateral nuclear disarmament. Under the previous Government, it was generally accepted that the number of Trident submarine warheads was about 300. When the Government took office, they reduced that to 200.<br><br>
Some argue that the United Kingdom has fewer operational warheads than the United States of America, Russia, France or China. We may have even fewer nuclear warheads than Israel, which is chilling in the light of events of the past 72 hours. That is not enough. We should go further. We need a nuclear weapons convention, and progress on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We should also encourage universal ratification of the comprehensive test-ban treaty. The Prime Minister may be able to raise that issue with President Bush when he visits him next month.<br><br>
Unilateral nuclear disarmament has never been less appropriate, as the events of 11 September surely taught us. Does anyone seriously think that Israel would renounce its nuclear capability if the United Kingdom abandoned nuclear weapons today, especially with Saddam Hussein in the region? Would there be an immediate change of heart in India or Pakistan? Would China renounce its nuclear weapons in the light of its anxiety about the consequences of ballistic missile defence? Would Saddam Hussein immediately stop any nuclear programmes? Multilateral—not unilateral—disarmament will make us safer. Unilateral renunciation of nuclear weapons would not make us or any other part of the world safer.<br><br>
A few weeks ago, the Minister and I attended a conference in Munich. A real anxiety was creeping in that the failure of the European members of NATO to maintain adequate defence spending had resulted in a substantially limited capacity to influence the only military superpower left in the world; the United States. President Bush has requested $48 billion—£32 billion—from Congress, which is £10 billion more than the whole UK budget. If I may conjure up a phrase from a previous year, the United States is about to embark on "the white heat of the technological revolution". That may have substantial consequences. Not only will the United States feel that it must go it alone, as others cannot go with it, but it will feel increasingly that it does not have to have regard to the political views of other NATO members. Everyone who takes the matter seriously should give the most serious consideration to the extent to which the UK and other European allies can maintain the capability that will give us political influence.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the discussion document, and the Liberal Democrats hope to give him a reasoned response in due course. However, the new chapter will stand a chance of being fully implemented
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
only if there are sufficient resources. Generals and politicians are always tempted to fight the last war; it is almost a part of the tradition of defence. A raft of new and innovative thinking is needed, not only because of the position immediately after 11 September, but because of the questions about resources to which I referred. There must now be scope, not only for a general increase in European defence budgets, but for a far higher degree of specialisation within the European members of NATO. That is always difficult because of the political arguments about jobs and so on, but a large amount of what we spend in Europe goes in duplication. A lot of it goes in national service; on soldiers who either for constitutional or capability reasons cannot be deployed in Afghanistan today.<br><br>
The Minister has rightly called upon us all to give careful consideration to this new chapter and we have an obligation to respond. I do not believe that the contents of that chapter will make the sort of contribution to defence that he, I and, I suspect, everyone in the Committee—including the SNP—agree is required in the new environment after 11 September, unless he can persuade another member of the Committee, his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of the importance of those issues.</span></p>
<p>11.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Joyce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood, for giving me a chance to say a few words in this important debate, particularly after the fine words from the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) and my right hon. Friend the Minister.<br><br>
The first duty of any Government is to ensure the security of their citizens. Many often forget that during periods of relative peace. That forgetfulness is a luxury that is afforded by the fact that during those times, professional service personnel continued to plan, to train and to argue their case for funding as if their services could be required at any time, as they often are. Most importantly, those same professionals have sought to preserve a preparedness to take risk, which to most people in this day and age is quite unimaginable. People talk about casualties, without thinking through the implications for the families. Troops take on the likelihood of taking risk as part of their jobs, but sometimes people are a little too light in how they talk about that level of risk.<br><br>
Since the Labour Government took office in 1997, we have moved into a period characterised by both certainty and uncertainty. The world security environment, particularly after 11 September, is quite uncertain. Our interests in many ways are converging in quite unexpected ways with countries such as Russia, as we work to help facilitate and encourage democracy while working to reduce instability and lawlessness across the world. At the same time, there is a greater sense of certainty of purpose than ever before outside years of total war.<br><br>
In operational theatre after operational theatre, the Labour Government have played a world-leading role. That is an overused term, but not in this case. They

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
have drawn a line in the sand and acted on ethnic cleansing, tribal slaughter and dictatorship in various parts of the world. The British role in NATO's intervention in Kosovo, for example, was central in ending the systematic repression of the Kosovan Albanians and returning almost 1 million refugees to their homes. In addition, more than 4,000 weapons were confiscated from the Kosovo Liberation Army.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Harris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would Slobodan Milosevic be facing trial at The Hague today had the British Government paid heed to the advice from the then leader of the SNP not to intervene in Kosovo, but to sit on our hands and watch from the sidelines?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for asking that important question. I feel confident that it will be answered by SNP Members when they get round to making speeches this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I recall, Slobodan Milosevic was ousted by the Serbian people in a Serbian election. Would the hon. Gentleman like to give some credit to the Serbian people for the removal of Slobodan Milosevic?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall find a moment at the end of my speech to say a few words about the Scottish National party, but the simple answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Harris) is no. Milosevic would still be there, swaggering around, and would never have been captured.<br><br>
I should like to move on. Following the terrorising of the population by local rebels in Sierra Leone, British forces helped to bring about the return of democracy and law and order. As my hon. Friends will recall, the terrorising included amputations and other horrors. In Bosnia, British forces have been at the forefront of the arrest of those suspected of war crimes. In Iraq, the RAF has policed the low-fly zones to protect the Iraqi Kurds in the north and the marsh Arabs in the south. In Afghanistan, a British-led force is making Kabul safer and freer than it has been for so many years.<br><br>
In each of those campaigns, men and women recruited in Scotland have—as throughout history—made a huge contribution. Scotland typically contributes about 13 per cent, of the armed forces' strength. In talking about Scotland's contribution to the armed services, people often refer to Scottish regiments, but Scotland's contribution goes much wider. Scottish regiments may be a little under-used on overseas deployments. Capable regiments such as the Parachute Regiment are rightly deployed, but I would like to see line regiments deployed rather more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In September and October last year, the 1st and 2nd Parachute Regiments took part in the NATO-led exercise, Operation Essential Harvest, in the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. By recovering more than 4,500 weapons from ethnic Albanian villages, they made that area much safer. I was fortunate enough to visit those regiments, which included many Scots, at the time. What role would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
such people have if they were members of a tartan army that had withdrawn from NATO?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am really not sure. The hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife spoke earlier about the need for real armed services to take part in different types of conflict, ranging from peacekeeping and peace-enforcing to total war. Under the sort of organisation that we may hear advocated by the SNP, forces would simply not have that capability. The answer to my hon. Friend's question is that they would have no role in such operations. [<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the Committee to maintain order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood.<br><br>
The people of Scotland—historically and presently—have much to be proud of in their contribution to British armed services. Defence planning and preparation, which prevents poor performance, is shored up by personnel policy, about which it is important to say a few words. It is not the sexy end of defence, but since 1997 the Government have had some huge successes, although these have not always been trumpeted very loudly.<br><br>
When the Labour Government first came to power in 1997, women were deployed in only a limited range of tasks; in particular, in only 30 per cent, of Army tasks. In the first couple of years, that extended to about 70 per cent. Gender-free and gender-fair testing was applied and I understand that the Army is presently considering the remaining 30 per cent, of tasks.<br><br>
The issue of women in the front line is greatly discussed. To some extent it is a judgment for society to make. I believe that women should be allowed in the front line, but it is a difficult issue. Successive Conservative Administrations, of course, chose not to tackle it. Great credit is due to the Labour Government for not being afraid to deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Luke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point about the contribution to our defence of the personnel side of the armed forces. Does he agree that one of the major strengths of the British forces is the Government's encouragement of skills and expertise; for example, in defence colleges throughout the UK, which ensure that the training of soldiers is of such a standard that British peacekeeping forces here and abroad can meet the demands that they increasingly face? Does my hon. Friend also agree that, given our contribution to the armed forces, it would be good to have a defence college in Scotland to cater for the specific needs of Scottish forces?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what my hon. Friend says. I am not sure about the configuration of training in Scotland—that decision would be for my right hon. Friend the Minister—but education and training are certainly at the heart of the UK armed forces' personnel policies. A huge amount of effort and money goes into education and training.<br><br>
Until 1997–98 or thereabouts, it was not widely officially recognised that the Army and the armed services across the board had a problem with race. That was swiftly recognised after the Labour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
Government came to office, and there have been a number of fairly successful initiatives to attract more members of ethnic minority communities to the services.<br><br>
I have been a little disappointed in the last couple of years, not by the MOD's efforts—quite the reverse—but sometimes by the efforts of members of ethnic minority communities to engage with the armed services' serious attempt to recruit more people. I hope that there will be more success in that direction in future.<br><br>
It is important to make a point about sexuality. I served in the forces for a while. People were always aware that there were gay people in the services, but no one felt that that should be said aloud, lest it have an impact on operational effectiveness. It was argued strongly that there would be no such impact, and of course there was not. I understand that the MOD now recognises that allowing gay personnel to continue in and to join the services has had a nil impact on operational effectiveness. The Labour Government have showed considerable courage, because the Clinton Administration in the United States tried a similar policy early on, probably with bad timing, and the political penalty was high. That is another matter for which the British Government deserve great credit, which they often do not receive in the press and the rest of the media.<br><br>
Another equal opportunities point, albeit a more complex and multi-layered one, relates to disability. We cannot rule out disabled people of certain gradations joining the services, but we must recognise that the multi-skilling of service people makes things difficult. We can analyse a job and say whether a disabled person can do it, but service people have to do a number of different types of job at short notice. That makes it difficult to analyse a job and say whether a person with a particular disability can do it. As I understand it, the MOD recognises the need to consider its responsibilities carefully; it has an exemption under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. In turn, we must recognise the practical implications for operational effectiveness.<br><br>
Defence policy is a serious business. A light note would be most inappropriate in this day and age, but perhaps I may use the word "lightweight", which of course brings me neatly to the Scottish National party. What are the points of reference for a putative or actual SNP defence policy? Yesterday, my staff asked the SNP head office who its parliamentary defence spokesperson was and they were told Colin Campbell MSP—[<i>Interruption</i>.] Where is he? He is in the Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
My staff pushed a little harder, asking who the Westminster spokesperson was. After several minutes of confused silence, shuffling of papers and asking of questions, the SNP finally came up with the name of the hon. Member for Moray. We have to give the SNP credit, because it had made a note before the debate. It had chalked on a blackboard somewhere the fact that it had a theoretical spokesperson here, but clearly it believes that the defence spokesperson should operate from Holyrood.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p><span class='member'>Pete Wishart <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the current Labour party Scottish policy was passed at the 1998 conference. Which parts of that policy does the hon. Gentleman agree with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a basic misunderstanding. Parties in government have Government policy—[<i>Interruption</i>.] I can hear the gasps of astonishment and amazement; I am educating hon. Members as I go. I am happy to take interventions if it will help their edification. I was talking about points of reference for Scottish National party defence policy and about Colin Campbell, who, sadly, is not here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my point and then I may give way.<br><br>
My second option was to look at the SNP's defence policy on its website, but no SNP policy is shown there at all. There is a good quote from John Swinney's post-11 September disavowal of NATO; we know that he is not a fan of NATO. However, the only serious thing that we could latch on to about the SNP's views on defence in an independent Scotland were the words in a staff paper written by a chap called Colonel Stuart Crawford. It is an interesting piece of work, a classic of its genre.<br><br>
Colonel Crawford is a good-quality cavalry officer who was a member of the Scottish National party. He left the Army and, as he would have done at staff college or as a staff officer at the Ministry of Defence, he used his expertise to write a serious paper on the implications for SNP policy—particularly defence policy—of an independent Scotland. It was a classic, well-written paper, but Colonel Crawford is not a politician and subsequently, when he was official defence spokesman for the Scottish National party, things came apart. He thought that he was putting forward an intelligent military analysis but it was actually a terrible expose of the mess that the SNP was in in respect of defence.<br><br>
Colonel Crawford talked about the nuclear military capability in a logical, coherent way and about the SNP's enthusiasm for getting rid of it overnight. I do not know what the party would do with it; perhaps sling a weight round it and throw it in the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Annabelle Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not now, as this is such a classic that hon. Members should hear it. Colonel Crawford asked what we should do if we got rid of the nuclear capability. He said that we should think about missiles and, in answer to the question what sort of missiles, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is well worth considering the utility of ballistic missiles … They can carry a wide variety of warheads, including chemical and biological payloads, which can be seen as a cheap alternative to nuclear ones for determined purposes."</p></blockquote>
He is right; it is a cheap alternative.
<br><blockquote><p>"Such attributes have made ballistic missiles the weapon of choice for many third world countries but the Scottish Defence Force might also find them an important asset in its armoury."</p></blockquote>
Faced with that analysis, the SNP quickly "disappeared" Colonel Crawford. The analysis was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0483">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
good, but it showed that it is an issue that the SNP simply cannot touch. Colonel Crawford discussed intelligently what happens if the linkage with the United Kingdom is ended and an independent Scotland creates a Scottish Army, Navy and Air Force. The SNP's defence policy—the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong—is to say that Scotland represents about 8.5 per cent, of the population of the United Kingdom, so let us have about 8.5 per cent, of the armed forces; that should just about do it. Colonel Stuart Crawford said, "Well, it is a pity, but 13 per cent., 14 per cent, or 15 per cent.—perhaps even higher than that—is represented by people in Scotland. What would be done with the others?" The Scottish National party's response to that, as it is to so many other policy issues, was a sustained silence.<br><br>
The Scottish National party also said that it would use the present infrastructure in Scotland for the new Army, Navy and Air Force, the expenditure of which would be minimal. It said that there were a couple of cadet huts and the odd camp about the place; three or four locations can deal with a reasonable concentration of forces. Colonel Crawford pointed out that we do not simply chop a bit off the end of the armed services to create new services. The issue is complex; it must be configured properly. The transferring measures would be hugely difficult, as would dealing with the equipment. I know that some of my hon. Friends want to say something about procurement and economies of scale. Such matters were flagged up by Colonel Crawford. He did us a service by showing that, when it comes to a central, real policy—the Government's first responsibility—the Scottish National party is often voiceless, although I hope that we shall hear something from it in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am about to finish.<br><br>
We can chuckle about the Scottish National party when we don ginger "Jimmy" wigs, but that will not give people confidence about serious issues such as defence. Defence is not a laughing matter. For the SNP, defence is worse than an afterthought. It exposes the hollowness of its political cause. It represents an intractable problem for those so obsessed with an outmoded philosophy that they are willing to turn a blind eye to a Government's primary responsibility.</span></p>
<p>11.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the debate, as does the Scottish National party. The terrorist outrages of 11 September and the ongoing challenges to defence and security policy make the subject very timeous. Specific Scottish perspectives on defence are of relevance not only to our country, but to our neighbours. I welcome several diplomatic observers from our closest small and medium-sized independent neighbouring countries to today's debate. I am only sorry that so many of their countries' defence policies have been characterised as they have been so far in the debate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Like the majority of members of the Committee, I have not served in the military. I have, however, been at the front line. In the early 1990s, I reported on the civil wars in Croatia and Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia. My impressions of defence issues and security are marked by Europe's ineffectiveness at that time in countering the genocide of Europe's oldest indigenous Muslim population. It is a standing shame and a disgrace to everyone in Europe that we stood by and allowed that to happen.<br><br>
The SNP and I are particularly committed to the role that the European Union has played—and is playing—in helping to avoid potential internal conflict, and to its plans to become more active in future. That commitment has an added dimension because I lost relatives who served in the regular armed forces on both sides in the second world war and I strongly support measures that will continue to make war unthinkable on our continent.<br><br>
It is also necessary for me to declare a strong constituency interest in the subject, as Moray contains two of the most significant RAF bases in the United Kingdom; RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth. I am certain that all members of the Committee agree that the service men and women at those bases do a first-class job. I am sorry that the Minister was unable to respond to my earlier intervention, but I am sure that he shares my disappointment that, as an affected Member of Parliament, I received no advance warning of last week's announcement about the Nimrod contracts. When I received notification, the letter said that the reduction in refitted Nimrods, which are almost exclusively based at RAF Kinloss, would be from 21 to 18. The letter from the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), says that there are no
<br><blockquote><p>"immediate implications for manning at RAF Kinloss."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister inform my constituents what is meant by "immediate"? That is a great source of concern to the service community at RAF Kinloss and elsewhere in Moray. Does the Minister wish to write to me about that, or will he answer my question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingrain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate somewhat because I did not communicate with the hon. Gentleman about that procurement decision, although I will examine its background. We try to inform hon. Members about changes, but we do not give them pre-warning or pre-knowledge. We give them due knowledge at the time—[<i>Interruption</i>.] There is no point in answering the hon. Gentleman because he is intervening on me while I try to give him a helpful answer.<br><br>
We pay tribute to all the work that is done at that station. I will not make the passing comment about how many Nimrods would be based there if there were to be an independent Scotland. I will examine the issue that the hon. Gentleman raised, and if there was a failure by the Department to communicate information to him, we will correct that in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply.<br><br>
The service personnel at both RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth have played significant roles in the campaign against terrorism and in the current training

exercises in Nevada and the Operation Saif Sareea exercises in Oman. The service community in Moray plays a key role in the economy and wider society of the district.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Sheridan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Renfrewshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take one point, as the Minister did, and then no more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Sheridan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the point that the hon. Gentleman raised about the bases in his constituency, will he confirm that an independent Scotland would maintain the bases in their current form?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously did not read the Scottish National party manifesto during the 2001 election. If he had, he would know that the SNP was the only party that gave an express commitment to maintain the bases.<br><br>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman intervened because I agree with him on a key issue that affects the service personnel at Lossiemouth; the threat of privatisation. That is one of the largest issues faced by service personnel in RAF bases throughout Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman, in addition to the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) and the hon. Members for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) and for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway) signed the early-day motion that opposed the privatisation of fire service provision at our air bases. I am certain that the service community at RAF Lossiemouth will welcome those Labour Members' commitment.<br><br>
I return to the SNP's association with praise for those who serve in all branches of the armed forces. I welcome the new chapter of the strategic defence review.<br><br>
I turn to the challenges that face Scotland's defence priorities at the start of the century.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not. The Minister set the precedent for lead speakers of each party to take only one intervention.<br><br>
All countries, including the UK, recognise that Europe has been unable to deal with the challenges that we face in the current set-up. As I said, even the UK has acknowledged that NATO alone cannot be relied upon totally to deal with European defence matters.—[<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair cannot hear the hon. Gentleman who is speaking. Some hon. Members commented earlier that they were keen to hear what the hon. Gentleman would say in his contributions. I hope that hon. Members will maintain good order so that it will be possible to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. Even the UK Government have acknowledged that NATO alone cannot be relied on totally to deal with European defence matters. That is why the SNP stands foursquare behind the emerging European security and defence policy of the European Union and is committed to the European rapid reaction force

and the headline goals for its operations—which are far more significant than the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife—who has left the Committee, as he told us that he would—believes. The Petersberg tasks are much more than what are characterised as purely gendarmerie tasks; they include combat force missions and missions to restore peace. That is where I see the European dimension of peacekeeping and peace-making going and the Scottish National party supports that.<br><br>
The next challenge in which I and my party believe is that of instilling the Scottish dimension into defence priorities for our country. The reasons for that are clear. There is a democratic deficit; all parties, with the exception of the Conservatives, agreed with the principle of the need to democratise politics in Scotland with the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. The settled will of the Scottish people ensured that the issues of security on our streets and of our fishery waters are decided in Scotland's Parliament. However, for some strange reason Unionist parties do not or cannot apply that logic to the issue of the security of our country. Unlike our neighbours in small and medium-sized independent states, such as Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Finland, our Parliament cannot decide on defence priorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not.<br><br>
The need for that democratic power is supported by the unwelcome current stationing of nuclear weapons in Scotland. Hon. Members will know that there is a clear majority in Scotland against Trident nuclear weapons being based on the Clyde. That was shown in last year's System Three poll, in which 58 per cent, of respondents opposed Trident; that figure included 64 per cent, of Labour voters and 54 per cent, of Liberal Democrat voters. It is a policy supported by deputy Scottish Labour leader Cathy Jamieson and, according to a "Newsnight" survey, by the biggest single group of Labour candidates for the 1999 elections.<br><br>
I could not agree more with the policy that states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Conference notes that Scotland now houses all of Britain's nuclear weapons and that the ‘Russian threat’ previously used to justify these weapons has disappeared.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Conference further notes that scrapping Trident now would save around 1.5 billion pounds annually which could and should be constructively employed in areas of obvious need such as housing, education and the health service as well as ensuring the creation of alternative employment and retraining of displaced defence workers."</p></blockquote>
Whose policy was that? It is the last one voted on by the Labour party following a debate at its Scottish conference in 1998. While Opposition Members may no longer agree with that principle, the Scottish National party, the Church of Scotland and many other civic groups in Scotland, as well as the majority of public opinion in our country, do agree with it. That is why we cannot take part in an alliance predicated on the first strike of weapons of mass destruction. That is a principle on which we are not prepared to compromise. All of that illustrates the excellent democratic argument for Scotland's Parliament to decide on defence matters and fulfil its obligations to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0485">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Scotland's settled will. Westminster will not deliver a nuclear-free Scotland.<br><br>
The second strong argument for Scottish defence priorities being decided in Scotland is economic. In January 2001, the Government were asked how much of the defence budget was spent in Scotland. A Defence Minister replied that the Defence Bills Agency had spent only 4.6 per cent, of its £15 billion budget in Scotland. That is a shortfall of £600 million to Scottish taxpayers in only one financial year. The Minister substantiated that figure today when he said that £1.4 billion is spent in Scotland from a total of £23.6 billion.<br><br>
The £600 million shortfall includes several examples of underspend in Scotland. The Services Training Agency spent only slightly more than 1 per cent, of the total £1.1 billion that was spent in the UK on training. The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency spent just 2.7 per cent, of its considerable budget in Scotland. There are 43 MOD agencies, of which only one has headquarters in Scotland. The shortfall in personnel who are stationed in home bases means that £90 million of wages and employers' contributions are lost to the Scottish economy.<br><br>
Instead of the massive reallocation of taxpayers' money from our economy—[<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not take the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hood. Is it in order for an hon. Member to represent the Opposition's view as he sees it, and not to take any interventions? Does that not reduce the level of debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order. I made it clear that it is up to the hon. Gentleman to decide whether he will take an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. I propose a positive argument in favour of how things would be prioritised in an independent Scotland if we allocated our spending and prioritised appropriately and sensibly, as our neighbouring countries choose to do. We would secure maximum benefit to the taxpayer through domestic procurement and, crucially, guaranteed offset contracts for the Scottish economy. No UK Defence Minister can deliver that for Scotland.<br><br>
I will explain what offset means to hon. Members who do not know. If one cannot construct or assemble the necessary equipment in the domestic market, the providing country guarantees to import products from one's own economy. Scotland does not have that arrangement, nor does the UK provide the same procurement spend that neighbouring countries provide. Sweden is constructing four more substantial craft than Scotland plans to construct. Norway is also having four more vessels constructed than Scotland, as part of an offset agreement. Other small, independent, non-aligned, non-nuclear
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
countries have a first-track record in the production of military equipment. Austria, for example, has developed an enviable industrial capacity with Glock and Steyr and produces some of the finest firearms and military transport vehicles.<br><br>
While we are on the subject of international comparisons, the Minister must agree that our neighbours and other small and medium-sized, independent, non-nuclear countries play a constructive role in international defence and security. Ireland, for example, has over 500 troops on UN missions, mostly in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Sweden has over 700 troops in Kosovo. Norway has 1,400 troops on international service, and Austria has nearly 1,000. Perhaps the Minister will tell us which Scottish regiments have been committed to the European Rapid Reaction Force, and how much total manpower that Scotland has committed. Is the figure close to 2000, which the Finns have pledged and the Austrians have promised?<br><br>
The positive role of independent non-nuclear countries is also seen in the leadership of Finnish General Gustav Hagglund, who heads the European Union military committee that brings together the European rapid reaction force. That shows the impact that a country of 5 million people can have in the new European context. I would like Scotland to follow those positive examples. We should be working together with our colleagues in England and Europe. We should be playing a peacekeeping role as a country not tainted by the highest megatonnage of nuclear weapons per head in the world. We can do better than act as an aircraft carrier for those who support a first-strike nuclear option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on aircraft?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am just concluding my remarks.<br><br>
Independence provides the opportunity, through current levels of per capita expenditure, to secure expanded manpower levels both for regular and reserve armed forces. Our tax contributions spent on defence procurement would then benefit all the Scottish economy, as opposed to a fraction of it, as is currently the case. That would also secure a defence diversification fund and guaranteed levels of service personnel and expenditure at bases including Lossiemouth and Kinloss. As I said before in answer to the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Mr. Sheridan), that was a pledge in the SNP party manifesto for the last election.<br><br>
That is the positive vision that I have for Scotland and defence, which should be democratically controlled in Scotland without the need for nuclear weapons.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members </span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have more speakers than I will be able to call. I advise hon. Members that I intend to call the Minister to reply at 12.45 pm.</span></p>
<p>12.16 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Anniesland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to be brief, unlike all the previous speakers. Like the SNP, I will not be talking about nationalist policies. For the information of the hon. Member for Moray, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Defence took six interventions to his measly one.<br><br>
Those who know me will not be surprised to learn that I am going to speak about shipbuilding. It is important that the country's past and position in the world should include its naval strength and its merchant trade. On the Clyde in the 19th and 20th centuries, we built some of the biggest ships in the world, which were probably of the best standard in the world. More than 100,000 people were employed on the Clyde alone at the industry's height. Unfortunately, by the 1960s some 200,000 people were employed in shipbuilding in the UK and, sadly, at the turn of the century we were down to 30,000.<br><br>
I must commend the Government, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of State in particular, for the work that they have done for shipbuilding in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. There is no doubt that there would be no shipbuilding in this country if it were not for the Government; it would have ended years ago. Unfortunately, we are the only party that could have brought shipbuilding back. We have given it a long-term future on the Clyde. I am thinking in particular about the Scotstoun yard in my constituency and the Govan yard.<br><br>
In the 1990s, the defence industry seemed to be on a downhill slope as peace came along with the break-up of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, during the past 10 years it has become a requirement for this country to help to police the rest of the world, and we and other countries have to look towards the defence industry not just for the security of the country, but for the security of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the SNP, I am happy to give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The welcome for the orders for the Type 45s extends well beyond the Govan yard on the Upper Clyde right down to Greenock and Inverclyde. Does he agree that workers in those yards will be alarmed to hear no commitment in today's debate from the Scottish nationalists to pursue the Type 45 building programme, or for the aircraft carriers? Those workers will be worried about whether we are fighting to preserve their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I agree that it is indicative of the SNP that, if it were to get power, there would be no Navy for Scotland and all the ships would go. If any SNP
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
Members would like to intervene, I would be happy to hear their views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will use this opportunity to speak to the 450 workers at Royal Ordnance Bishopton? He may also want to say something to the 450 people working on the Clyde who have lost their jobs in the past year. Will he compare and contrast them with the 14,000 people working in shipbuilding in Finland and the 10,000 in Norway?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for once again being selective with the figures that he uses. If I can save 6,000 jobs in Scotland in the defence industry alone, how many does the hon. Gentleman think that he could save? Does he honestly think that his party could sustain shipbuilding? The nationalists would do nothing to protect the people of Scotland. All they ever do is decry Scotland. They have no policies whatever to help the people of Scotland. They do my country no favours.<br><br>
I ask the Minister—as I have done on many occasions—to look at shipbuilding and where our Navy fits in with defence policy. We are somewhat lacking in our naval capabilities, especially if there were another occasion such as the invasion of Afghanistan, in which we had to use American ships for most of the work. We would not be able to do something like that ourselves. Can we find some way within our defence policy to increase capability so that, if we ever had to mount a defence or an attack, we would have the necessary weapons and ships at our disposal?<br><br>
May I also say once again that the Government did an excellent job with shipbuilding? My constituents in Glasgow Anniesland would like to thank the Minister for saving jobs; nearly a quarter of them belong to people who live in my constituency. He has helped to keep them employed.<br><br>
Over the past few days, I have noticed that a new policy appears to be emerging in the newspapers, television and radio. I am concerned that we seem to be heading towards some kind of war with or invasion of Iraq. Although that is a national problem, the people of Scotland will say, "What's happening?" Will Ministers please tell us what is going on? We heard Ministers talking last night about how we must take on such people as Saddam but I have received no information on the subject from the Prime Minister or the Ministry of Defence. I am concerned that this is a case of spin to win. They will try to soften the blow of whatever is going to happen tonight. We must ask questions, because matters are now going too far. I would be pleased if the Minister could allay my fears, but I see horrible things happening and am very concerned that our troops may be falling into the deep end without consultation of Parliament</span></p>
<p>12.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Duncan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, for your benefit, Mr. Hood, and for that of the Committee, can I confirm that I am indeed the defence spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives in the Committee? I did not want any confusion to detain the debate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0487">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
I share the concern that some earlier contributions were on the lengthy side. In the short time available, I shall be happy to take interventions from both sides of the Committee. Any play-acting on that score lowers the standard of debate. The Committee should rise above that. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (John Robertson) is an exception to my criticism.<br><br>
We, the Scottish Conservatives have a proud vision—[<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask for order for the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood.<br><br>
I have a positive vision for defence in Scotland. Defence is key to our economy and I would like to say something about how it interacts at a local level, rather than at the national Scottish level. As has been said, defence expenditure in Scotland is estimated at £1.8 billion, supporting 60,000 jobs indirectly and directly. The Minister made a powerful case for the importance of defence to our Scottish economy. It is an industry in which Scotland has excelled historically and in which the Scottish Conservatives believe that we can excel in the future.<br><br>
Defence makes a huge and disproportionate contribution to very localised economies, as the hon. Member for Moray explained. In my constituency, the small community of Kirkcudbright is hugely dependent on a small number of jobs. Although I recognise that there are a significant number of shipbuilding jobs in the constituency of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (Mr. Robertson), sometimes in a small community, a trivial number of MOD-derived jobs can make a huge impact. Kirkcudbright is a good example. I welcome the recent announcement of £5 million of investment by the MOD in troop-training facilities at the Dundrennan range, which will have a huge spin-off benefit for the local town.<br><br>
Defence is an industry of growing high technology. West Freugh in my constituency, run by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, depends crucially on the testing of MOD technology. I am disappointed—although hon. Members will not be surprised at this—that it has been subject to some politicking from the nationalists lately—[<i>Interruption</i>.] I know that that is a huge revelation to all hon. Members. The nationalists have, somewhat inexcusably, criticised the Government for transferring it into the private sector, although the defence policy of the SNP, should it ever be in government, would make West Freugh, with the whole defence research business in Scotland, immediately unsustainable.<br><br>
More can and should be done to maximise the value of MOD assets in local communities. I have corresponded with the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy about the facility at West Freugh, potentially a huge asset to its local area. More could be done to investigate the creation of spin-off jobs. I venture to suggest that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
private sector could become more involved in developing those assets. The jobs created would be quality jobs delivering significant salaries in areas of Scotland, such as my constituency and that of the hon. Member for Moray, where salaries are otherwise small.<br><br>
I make a small digression on nationalist policy. I feel as though I am interfering in a private party between the nationalists and the Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling me that the nationalists have a policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not go that far. I will explain. They have obviously undertaken some blue-skies thinking on defence and with their proposals for a Scottish defence force have produced a policy that is pie in the sky. Their half-baked 2001 manifesto suggested that there would "negotiations" to separate Scotland's defence. That is ridiculous. Scotland's defence depends on the United Kingdom's defence force and the most successful fighting force in the world cannot be divided. Their qualifications on NATO are simply inexplicable. They recognise that themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Harris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that a couple of weeks after 11 September, when the Secretary-General of NATO Lord Robertson was invoking clause 5 of the NATO treaty, the leader of the SNP was quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"An independent Scotland should be out of NATO"?</p></blockquote>
Should we expect that cynical betrayal of our allies or was it a one-off?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That requires no further comment from me, but I suspect that it will not be a one-off—it never is. The SNP suggests a Scotland that would hang on the coat tails of those who have the courage and the political determination adequately to defend themselves. It should be deprecated. Defence is one of our key responsibilities at Westminster, yet when one reflects on the nationalists' performance on the issue the reality is somewhat different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman heard earlier about decisions on Rosyth and Devonport, which certainly focused the minds of people in Scotland on the performance of the Conservative party on defence. At that time did the hon. Gentleman have a view on where the contract should have gone and what was that view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not have a view then, as I was not in active politics at the time. [<i>Interruption</i>.] If the hon. Gentleman will give me a moment I will make clear my personal position. That was one of the greatest mistakes in our time in power. I am happy to make that clear.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is keen to focus on the Conservative position. Can I return briefly to the nationalist position? If any further evidence is needed on the defence-shy SNP, I have a list of the key defence debates—since the first day of the Scottish Parliament in 1999—that SNP Members should have attended to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0488">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
listen and learn about UK defence, but somehow did not feel fit to speak at. They did not speak at the debates on armed services personnel on 1 July 1999, defence in the world on 10 July 1999 or foreign affairs and defence in November 1999. They did not speak on either debate on the defence White Paper in February 2000. They did not attend the debate on armed services personnel last year and they did not speak in the debates on defence in the world and defence and the armed forces. No SNP Member of Parliament even voted on the Armed Forces Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Weir <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman started this little tirade with the comment that this was in the Scottish Parliament. When did the Armed Forces Bill appear in the Scottish Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen more carefully. I said that since the Scottish Parliament first met, these were the debates held in Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joyce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall focus on two issues where I would like to be more positive. My constituency was severely affected by foot and mouth disease. This month marks the first anniversary of the first case in Scotland. The role of our forces during the foot and mouth prevention programme was significant and shows the correct policy towards the Territorial Army. We welcomed the expanded role envisaged for the TA, but it should not be at the expense of our regular army. The TA played a crucial role in FMD control, when 90 volunteers were available at short notice and showed the flexibility and local knowledge that is the key to their existence.<br><br>
We opposed the reduction of TA numbers from 59,000 to 41,000, which was part of the 1998 strategic defence review. We are pleased that we have been proved right and that a new chapter now being written will see that rectified. September 11 highlights the need for a volunteer TA with local knowledge as its key and speed of call-up as its unique selling proposition. It plays a key role in recruitment to the services, which is increasingly becoming a problem.<br><br>
We have a proud defence history. Scotland's defence is inseparable from UK defence. Together, our defence is stronger.</span></p>
<p>12.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Rachel Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to concentrate my remarks on the importance to Scotland of defence-related jobs. We have heard many statistics and I shall not repeat them all, but the figures of 46,000 defence industry-related jobs and 25,000 civilian and armed forces personnel in Scotland are important. One day I would be interested to hear what percentage of Scotland's gross domestic product the SNP would be prepared to spend in an independent Scotland to maintain the many thousands of jobs currently available.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) on one point—that I have never seen so many SNP Members present at a defence debate. They are usually notable for their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
absence, unless they think that a headline might be forthcoming.<br><br>
I welcome the defence procurement decisions recently made by the UK Government and the excellence of Scotland's engineering skills. I welcome the £230 million order for Thales Optronics to supply night vision equipment on armoured vehicles, the confirmation of the Eurofighter Typhoon work, which the SNP opposes, and the excellent decision on type 45 frigates, which will provide a future for Scotland's proud shipbuilding traditions.<br><br>
Last year, the Ministry of Defence alone spent about £600 million in Scotland, sustaining jobs in defence manufacturing. The one estimate that I have managed to obtain from the SNP's planned defence procurement is about £300 million. Frankly, that would buy one and a bit frigates and no more, which would leave a bleak future for the work force at Rosyth, Govan and Scotstoun in an independent Scotland.<br><br>
I shall speak for just a couple of minutes—I want to allow other hon. Members to enter the debate—on Rosyth dockyard, which has undertaken many changes in response to the challenges of the past 10 years. It is now under private ownership and has changed its core work from submarines to ship refitting. I am proud to say that the skills, workmanship and standards maintained by the dockyard work force are widely recognised and that the Labour Government have maintained the allocated programme of work to which they committed themselves.<br><br>
Many further opportunities remain. We all welcome the possible diversification that the Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry may bring, but naval ship refitting will always remain the core work for the dockyard. With the continuing support of the Minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland and my hon. Friends, I look forward to working for a secure future for Rosyth.<br><br>
I will end my comments, to allow some of my hon. Friends to speak. There has been much to celebrate in the Scottish defence industry in recent months. Scotland's skilled work force and service personnel have always played a key role in the United Kingdom's defence. They are proud to be Scottish, but they are also proud to be part of the UK's armed forces and defence policy. I look forward to working with colleagues in supporting that tradition and maintaining the high professionalism and worldwide reputation of the UK's armed forces.</span></p>
<p>12.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>John Thurso <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Judging by the time, I think that I have three minutes to wind up on this fascinating debate, which is not long enough—although I could wind up with one sentence, which would be, "North-East Fife 3, Moray 0."<br><br>
The debate has predominantly addressed the international front, but I wish to turn to a couple of domestic matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) referred to low flying areas. With regard to them, I wish to raise the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0489">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
subject of wind farms—and, bearing in mind a debate that took place during the previous sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee, I hope that they will not be referred to as health farms. North of the Great Glen, 80 per cent, of the land mass is covered by low flying area and, as far as I am aware, the Ministry of Defence has never agreed to permit a wind farm to be established in that region—I know of one case in which permission was sought in my constituency. I have been in correspondence with the Under-Secretary of State for Defence on the subject, and I wish the Minister to look into it.<br><br>
With regard to the range at Cape Wrath, to which the Minister has referred, I recently attended a meeting of its liaison group, where Commander Bertie Armstrong gave a categorical assurance that depleted uranium munitions had never been used on that range, and that they never would be. I wrote to the Minister to ask him to confirm that, and the response that-1 received was—to say the least—vague. I wish him to confirm what the Navy has said, which is that no depleted uranium has been used at Cape Wrath, and nor will it be.<br><br>
I also wish the Minister to consider the representations that are being made in my constituency by the community councils in the area of Tain, where a bombing range is located that is an important asset to the MOD.<br><br>
All the subjects that I have raised stem from changes in the contract between society and the MOD. External changes are also taking place, and we must take more account of the needs of the community than we did in the past.</span></p>
<p>12.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join in the well-deserved congratulations that have been offered to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces for his comprehensive and positive contribution on the subject of defence in Scotland. We expected nothing less from him.<br><br>
I also congratulate the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife for his informed and constructive contribution, as well as other hon. Members for their comments, and I will reply to as many of them as possible. I wish particularly to respond to the hon. Member for Moray. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces will write to hon. Members about specific constituency points, if I am unable to answer them.<br><br>
The debate has underlined the importance of defence;—and of defence's contribution to the people and economy of Scotland. It has also underlined the continuing importance of the Scottish Grand Committee, and I am glad that all five SNP Members have sat through the debate and constructively contributed to the Committee's work. That represents an encouraging step forward.<br><br>
Not only is defence in the UK provided for the UK on behalf of all the British people but, following the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
events of 11 September, it has taken on even more global significance. Because of that, it is vital that we no longer get parochial contributions of the type that we have heard from certain quarters.<br><br>
Scotland receives at least our fair share of expenditure, not only in defence but in all Government spending. The latest available figures showed that Government expenditure in Scotland was about £34 billion or 9.8 per cent, of United Kingdom Government expenditure. Total receipts in Scotland were estimated at about £30 billion or 8.3 per cent, of UK receipts. With a population share of 8.6 per cent., any reasonable impartial observer would consider Scotland's position to be very fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?—[<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But as the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said, some people in the Chamber are not reasonable. I shall give way to one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister is as familiar with the figures as he claims to be. Those that he quoted do not include most of the defence budget because that is set as a United Kingdom central expenditure figure. Is that not an example of how the figures that he has quoted exclude what Scotland receives under its population share and are used to present the misleading argument that used to be the preserve of English Conservative Members of Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the hon. Gentleman has jumped the gun. I am about to refer to defence expenditure. Defence is not undertaken throughout the United Kingdom on the basis of population share. We spend money on defence, we manage resources, we manage people, and we manage equipment on the basis of the defence needs of Britain as a whole. It is clear from the figures that Scotland does not lose out in the process.<br><br>
I reinforce what my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces said earlier. Let us consider defence expenditure in Scotland. There is direct expenditure of £1.4 billion. When added to the indirect expenditure, the amount is £1.8 billion. The year-on-year growth in recent times under the financial stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the fact that Ministry of Defence employment in Scotland amounts to 24,800 military and civilian personnel give Scotland the third largest defence footprint in the United Kingdom. It is the only part of the United Kingdom to have experienced a growth in numbers in the year 2000. That is an encouraging step forward. Not only are the numbers important, but it is what they mean to the local, often rural, economy that really counts. Rural areas, such as Moray, are well served by defence expenditure, as are Angus and North-East Fife.<br><br>
If the SNP continues to twist the figures and to claim that Scotland loses out in defence spending, is it looking for an increase? Where can cuts be made to achieve that? For example, the hon. Member for Moray expressed his commitment to maintain bases, but he did not express how or for what purpose they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0490">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
would be maintained. He said also that he would keep Bishopton open. How and for what purpose?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to be!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angus Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to a question that was tabled last year, it was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence that the Defence Bills Agency paid defence contractors based in Scotland some £691 million during 1999–2000, which is 3 per cent. The difference in tax revenue is what keeps bases open and what gives Scotland vibrant and effective armed forces.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one specific point. We hear nitpicking daily about major issues that affect Scotland. We have witnessed the cynicism of the SNP. I would have said "hypocrisy", but I know that you would not allow me to use that word, Mr. Hood. On one hand, the SNP wants to close bases in Scotland, while on the other, it moans about the loss of jobs as a consequence of such policy. One good example is its opposition to the United States presence at Holy Loch. But when the Americans left, it attacked the Government because there was a scaling down of HMS Gannet. What was scaled down? The submarine surveillance unit, which was in place because of Holy Loch.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan asked the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale about Rosyth and Devonport. If the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan had his way, it would not only be Rosyth that did not have the work; neither would Devonport. As always, members of the Scottish National party want it both ways. They use kindergarten, not grown-up, politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have given way enough.<br><br>
I understand that the SNP is reviewing its position on NATO and has set up a study group. It is currently opposed to NATO, but it is looking to future policy. We have seen the signs of not only a little split, but a major chasm in SNP policy.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State rightly said that the Black Watch had a successful tour in Kosovo. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan had an unsuccessful tour in relation to Kosovo. We recall that that was described as unpardonable folly. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would, for once, be big enough to apologise for one of the many errors that he made. Milosevic is now before an international court of justice. We are glad to see that and it was rightly due to the Serbian people, although it would not have been possible without the external intervention that the hon. Gentleman opposed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray proposed the European security and defence policy as his alternative to NATO. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife said that the effectiveness of the whole operation depended on NATO and on European Union membership. We know that the SNP party conference last weekend conceded that continued membership of the European Union by an independent Scotland was not automatic. In fact, we would face many dangers as a consequence.<br><br>

A recently published book by Chalmers and Walker called "Uncharted Waters: The UK, Nuclear Weapons and the Scottish Question" sums up the matter correctly. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The SNP's long standing assumption that EU and NATO membership could be approached separately, without political linkage, currently seems mistaken … The SNP's policy on NATO membership has shown little consistency."</p></blockquote>
External, unbiased and impartial observers wrote that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The SNP is implacably opposed to nuclear weapons in Scotland. We heard that past Scottish Labour party policy was against Trident. Does the Minister agree with the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Joyce) that that is irrelevant to Government policy? What relevance does Scottish Labour party policy have to the Minister and the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave way—yet again—to the hon. Gentleman in the hope that he would apologise for his unpardonable folly. Instead, he repeated parrot fashion a question to which he knows the answer. It is appropriate that the large picture behind you, Mr. Hood, is entitled "The flight of the five Members".<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West asked about women on the front line. That policy is under review, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of State informs me that an announcement will be made shortly.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Orkney and Shetland and for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) asked about wind farms and low flying. The Ministry of Defence has justifiable worries about the development of wind farms in tactical training areas. If aircraft fly down to 250 ft and the farms are taller than that, there could be cause for concern. We cannot dismiss lightly the safety of aircrew and the public. Several tactical training areas are the most advantageous areas for the positioning of wind farms, which, incidentally, we can discuss in more detail later on the Floor of the House. Later this month, I will attend a meeting with the relevant Ministers from the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Scottish Executive to discuss such issues. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentlemen.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West mentioned the possibility of a defence college in Scotland. The Ministry of Defence is considering expanding the Army foundation college, and sites in Scotland will receive full consideration. However, no decisions have been taken. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend, and my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke).<br><br>
Several questions were asked about procurement and prime contract awards. I can draw hon. Members' attention to the increasing value of Ministry of Defence equipment contracts awarded to prime contractors in Scotland. In 1998–99, they were worth £207 million, rising to £243 million in 1999–2000 and to £248 million in 2000–01. We can be pleased about those contracts. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland mentioned the Clyde; I want to pay tribute to the work done by all members of the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
Clyde taskforce, to the interest shown by local Members of Parliament in the work, and especially to the positive contribution of the trade unions to the work of the taskforce, which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of redundancies that will be necessary. That is a good example of co-operation between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government; the trade unions, management, local Members of Parliament and MSPs were all involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ensure that the Ministry of Defence looks further north and is aware that the skills necessary in the hostile and challenging technical environment in the North sea provide many transferable assets that could be used in Ministry of Defence contracts? Will the hon. Gentleman ensure that the MOD works closely with the industries to consider how best to introduce economies of scale and to improve efficiency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces has taken that on board and will consider it sympathetically.<br><br>
I, too, am looking north: RAF Leuchars employed more than 1,500 personnel and the continued significance of the base was shown by its confirmation as an operational base for the Eurofighter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that on 12 September, after the atrocities of 11 September, NATO provided some hope because an attack against one country is attack against them all? RAF airborne warning and communication system aircraft flew over the eastern seaboard of the United States, protecting the whole area, while the United States Air Force defended the homeland. After that terrorist atrocity and NATO's help, is it not shameful that the SNP would refuse to join NATO and therefore would not have played any part in that defence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which shows the value of NATO and the stupidity of any party that suggests withdrawing from it.<br><br>
Leuchars will further benefit from the early move of the aircraft operations element of the Tornado F3 operational conversion unit from RAF Coningsby, which will increase personnel by 450 posts. The UK's main Tornado base and the largest fast jet operating base is in Lossiemouth, Morayshire. It is one of the major employers in the area, with around 2,000 personnel. I wish that there had been more acknowledgment and understanding of its importance, not just to the local economy but to Scotland.<br><br>
Her Majesty's naval base on the Clyde has about 6,500 personnel; it is one of the largest—if not the largest—single site industrial employers. The planned establishment of the Astute class training service centre at Faslane will add a further 20 new jobs when in operation, in addition to about 150 jobs sustained in the construction phase, approximately 70 of which will be in Scotland. They would all be under threat if there were any possibility of the SNP
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
achieving its clearly stated, open policy of independence.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces explained about the contracts for five type 23 frigates awarded to Babcock Rosyth, and the 16 personnel and vehicle landing craft contract, also awarded to Rosyth, and the award of the contract for two landing craft to BAE Systems on Clydeside. I was privileged to sign that contract on behalf of my right hon. Friend; I have never signed a contract for so much in my life. I was exercising real power on behalf of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A prenuptial contract.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman, speaking from a sedentary position, reminds me that a contract that I entered into in 1970 cost me a great deal.<br><br>
The Minister of State touched on the hidden benefits of awards such as the type 45 programmes to BAE Systems, the six type 45 destroyers to Clydeside, and the contract to Rolls Royce Marine, Dalgety bay. Scotland is stronger and better defended by being part of the larger whole that is the United Kingdom. We live in an uncertain world. The people of Scotland deserve the best defence that we can offer them. That means being part of the United Kingdom rather than standing apart.<br><br>
The converse is also true: defence in the United Kingdom is enhanced by Scottish participation in industry, and by its manpower and bases. United Kingdom defence is good for Scotland and it makes sense for the UK. This Government will keep it that way.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

Maritime Transport Services</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the Committee do now adjourn.—[<i>Mrs. McGuire</i>.]</p>
<p>1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that many hon. Members are aware of the parody of the 24th psalm that goes:
<br><blockquote><p>"The earth is the Lord's, and all it contains, except the Western Isles, which belong to MacBrayne's."</p></blockquote>
That parody emphasises the importance of shipping services to islanders and how the shipping companies can exercise control over the economy of islands.<br><br>
For many years, shipping services to the islands and peninsulas of the Clyde and the Western Isles have been provided by the state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne company. European Union regulations now stipulate that those services be put out to competitive tender, but that transport service, like many others, does not lend itself to competition. It is a monopoly in many ways, because with one exception—Dunoon to Gourock—these lifeline ferry routes will not generate enough traffic to allow two companies to compete on the same route.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0492">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
Transport has in many ways been the Achilles heel of the Labour Government. We can think of Railtrack, air traffic control and the London underground. In all cases, problems have arisen when they have tried to bring competition or privatisation into what is effectively a transport monopoly.<br><br>
The European regulations on maritime transport were passed by the Council of Ministers at its meeting in Brussels on 7 December 1992. The signature on the legislation is that of John MacGregor, who was then President of the Council and a Tory Transport Minister. At the start of the British presidency six months earlier, Mr. MacGregor boasted in a written answer that he would
<br><blockquote><p>"take forward the increasingly rigorous application of the state aid rules in the transport sector so as to provide for full and proper competition in the single market."</p></blockquote>
He certainly succeeded in that aim: he drove the resolution through the Council.<br><br>
However, Mr. MacGregor clearly had not a clue what he was talking about, because in the same written answer he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The anachronism of the United Kingdom and some other member states having their coastal trades open while the rest did not will be ended."—[<i>Official Report</i> 24 June 1992; Vol. 210, c.<i>248</i>.]</p></blockquote>
He seemed completely unaware that, within the UK, the Caledonian MacBrayne-operated ferries were not open to competition. When he signed the legislation into law, he seemed unaware of the situation on the CalMac routes.<br><br>
The legislation was due to come into effect on 1 January 1993, only a few weeks after it was passed. However, both Tory Secretaries of State for Scotland during the latter years of the Tory Government—the noble Lords Lang of Monkton and Forsyth of Drumlean, to give them their new titles—wisely ignored the legislation that their Cabinet colleagues had signed into law. Even the arch-privatiser Lord Forsyth decided that this was a privatisation too far. Incidentally, that gave the lie to the widespread notion that we in Britain obey European laws while other countries do not.<br><br>
The Commission eventually noticed that the UK was not complying with the maritime legislation and ordered the Scottish Executive to comply. My purpose in applying for the debate was to ask the Minister, even at this late hour, to go to Brussels and ask for a derogation from that hopelessly unworkable legislation. It was designed to open up lucrative coastal trades in southern Europe to competition, not to force privatisation on the totally unprofitable routes on the west coast of Scotland. As I have shown, the President of the Council who signed the legislation into law did not know what he was talking about.<br><br>
A huge majority of my constituents want CalMac to continue to operate these lifeline services. CalMac has its faults, as we all admit, but it is a public body that can be lobbied and pressurised into making changes. It holds regular consultative meetings with representatives of the islanders that it serves. Crews often live on the islands and are part of the local community. A large proportion of the work force on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
small islands work for CalMac and the crews have a commitment to those islands, whereas a private operator—coming from outside, possibly the far side of Europe—will sail the ships simply for profit, not for the benefit of the island communities.<br><br>
The European legislation ignores the fact that shipping services comprise many elements—vessels, crews, piers and harbours. To enact the legislation, a vessel-owning company, a vesco, and an operating company, an opco, will be necessary.<br><br>
The piers and harbours are owned by many different organisations—some by CalMac some by trusts, and others by local authorities. A multiplicity of contracts between all those disparate bodies will be necessary: does that not remind hon. Members of the failed railway privatisation?<br><br>
What will happen if the opco goes bankrupt? Will the state still retain the expertise to step in and pick up the pieces? I doubt it. The lack of flexibility is another problem. Under European rules, the contract will last for five years, but circumstances change every year and a five-year operating contract does not provide flexibility. Under current arrangements, no one would dream of setting timetables for five years in advance, but that will have to be done. For other reasons, five years is not long enough—not for an operator to get a return on investment in a new vessel, for example. The danger is that no investment in new ferries will be made.<br><br>
Problems are already apparent because of the lack of investment caused by uncertainty. Dunoon pier is, I regret to say, ready to fall into the sea. Whenever there is a gale, people living in Dunoon look out the next morning hoping that the pier will still be there. Uncertainty is preventing the necessary investment—either for repairing the current structure or for constructing a new berthing facility. The Scottish Executive and the European regional development fund will not commit funds because they do not know what type of vessel will be sailing on this route. CalMac cannot say what type of vessel, because it does not know whether it will win the contract. That demonstrates how the infrastructure of piers, harbours and vessels is linked. The new rules will cause complete nonsense and the danger is that the farce will continue because we will always be fewer than five years away from the end of a contract.<br><br>
Uncertainty over the future has also prevented CalMac from bidding for the Campbeltown-Ballycastle route. It is the local people's preferred bidder, after the complete mess that the private company, Sea Containers, made of operating the service. The Minister has worked hard towards restarting this service, which failed under a private operator. What stage has the tendering process reached?<br><br>
I can provide the Minster with another horror example—as well as Railtrack—of a transport route that failed under the same system proposed for the CalMac routes—the Jura ferry, which runs from Jura across to Port Askaig on Islay. It is owned by a public body—Argyll and Bute council—as are the berthing facilities at either side, but is run by a private operator.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0493">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
The result has been sheer farce: sailings frequently cancelled, making children late for school, and the distillery on Jura losing vital deliveries. The system has failed miserably and does not suggest itself as a suitable model for the large-scale CalMac contract. Both this farce and that of the Dunoon pier demonstrate the need for an integrated system comprising vessels, operators and berthing facilities—a system that the European legislation removes.<br><br>
The legislation has already wasted a great deal of taxpayers' money. CalMac has spent considerable sums engaging consultants and devoted a great deal of energy preparing for the tendering process. That time and energy would have been better spent improving ferry services.<br><br>
There is also confusion within the rules as to whether the state aid can provide for services to remote peninsulas. The 1992 legislation says that state subsidies can only be paid for services between two islands or between mainland and island. That ignores the geography of the west coast of Scotland, where there are many long peninsulas and where a short sea voyage can save many hours of driving. The legislation may cause confusion by not defining what an island is. Hon. Members may think that whether a piece of land is an island or not is obvious, but I invite hon. Members to ponder whether Skye is still an island. Do Kintyre and Knapdale comprise an island because the Crinan canal separates them from the rest of Scotland? The question is important—the future of the Portavadie-Tarbert ferry could depend on it.<br><br>
The British Tories made no effort to secure special status for special areas, but other countries were not so lax. France, Spain, Portugal and Greece all obtained derogations of some sort. In Spain's case, it was written into the legislation that—I apologise to any Spanish speakers for what I am about to say and the Minister may correct me—Ceuta and Melilla were to be treated as islands, ignoring the fact that those communities are clearly part of the African continent. Thanks to the Tories, there is no special status for remote peninsulas such as Kintyre.<br><br>
The islands and peninsulas of the west coast of Scotland have a very fragile economy. The unwanted legislation could well wreck those economies completely. It was never designed for such an application and was promoted by a Tory Minister who demonstrated that he had not got a clue about circumstances in Scotland. Local people want to keep CalMac. I urge the Minister to consult local opinion and to go to Brussels and seek a derogation from the legislation to allow CalMac's present arrangements to continue. I hope that he will not support a privatisation that even Lord Forsyth shied away from implementing.</span></p>
<p>1.11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) on securing a debate on an issue that I know is of importance to the United Kingdom,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
to Scotland in particular and, above all, to his constituency, which is in a beautiful part of the world; almost as beautiful as Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.<br><br>
I understand most of what the hon. Gentleman said. I do not disagree with his criticism of Mr. MacGregor, who has caused us many problems. The hon. Gentleman says that transport is our Achilles' heel, but I am sure that if he gave the matter further consideration, he would realise that we had a huge mess to clear up. The investment that we have made and the reform that we have undertaken are improving matters. It will take time, but we are determined to make sure that we have a first-class public transport system—on land, sea and air—that is suitable for the 21st century.<br><br>
His question of what is an island is almost philosophical, although I am sure that there are practical determinations of it. As to the European Union's decision on whether Ceuta and Melilla are islands, it seems from what the hon. Gentleman says that the EU has power that even the Lord God Almighty does not have.<br><br>
When considering maritime legislation within member states, we are principally considering two documents: first, Council regulation 3577 of 1992, which sets out the freedom to provide maritime transport services within member states and, secondly, the European Commission's community guidelines on state aid to maritime transport, which were published in 1997. The latter is not a piece of European legislation, but it provides detailed guidance on how the 1992 regulations and other matters such as social security and taxation for seafarers should be interpreted and implemented in member states.<br><br>
The 1992 regulation forms an integral part of the framework of the single market. The aim is to provide for free and open access to shipping services throughout the Community. The Government believe that, if fully achieved, that liberalised market offers British—including Scottish—companies good commercial opportunities throughout the EU that outweigh any potential implications of opening up our own domestic public services.<br><br>
I agree that no system is perfect. The Commission is sensibly looking at how the legislation operates in practice and it will issue two documents later this year. The first is the Commission's stated five-year review of the Community guidelines, which is expected to be finished by the summer. The second is a communication on the interpretation of the 1992 regulations. It will seek to clarify issues that have arisen in implementing the regulations and may include the issue of the treatment of services to small islands. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about that. That communication is expected at around the end of the year. The Commission will seek the views of the member states on both of those documents. The Government will ensure that Scottish concerns are taken into account both through direct contact with the industry and our contacts with the Scottish Executive.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
I mentioned earlier that maritime legislation was of particular importance to Scotland. That is especially so in relation to our extensive coastline, with its many peripheral and island communities where the provision of ferry services has social importance. As hon. Members will be aware from the previous Adjournment debate of this Committee, initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns), European maritime legislation is not flexible enough to rule out state intervention of any kind. The 1997 Community guidelines provide for member states to declare a public service obligation in circumstances where the market would not be able to provide the required levels of service to meet lifeline or economic development needs.<br><br>
The declaration of a PSO by a member state allows for a public subsidy to be paid to an operator identified through a properly conducted tendering process. Within Scotland, that procedure has been or is in the process of being applied in three instances: the services to and within Orkney and Shetland; the services on the west coast currently served by CalMac and the proposed new Campbeltown to Ballycastle service. The latter two are of course of direct importance to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute and I am aware of and appreciate the interest he has shown in these matters over a long period.<br><br>
While overall responsibility for European Union matters and for general shipping policy is reserved, as expected, from the primary purpose of those services, the Scottish Executive are responsible for the current CalMac tendering process. The Scottish Executive are, in fact, the owners of CalMac, whose current services operate solely within Scotland. Subject to the agreement of both this and the Scottish Parliament—and in co-operation with Northern Ireland Ministers—Scottish Ministers will also be responsible for services between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland. An order to devolve executive powers to Scottish Ministers under section 63 of the Scotland Act 1998 will be laid in this House shortly. I encourage him to keep pressing his hon. Friends in the Scottish Parliament just as I continue to press mine to make sure that we get a speedy response from them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the role that the Scotland Office has played in helping to bring the Ballycastle to Campbeltown service to the point where both Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers are publicly committed to tendering for an operator to begin services next spring. The Government have also worked closely with the Scottish Executive in presenting arguments to the European Commission to ensure that the best possible structure for CalMac services may be put out to tender. Just as we have been working with the Executive on Campbeltown to Ballycastle, we have worked with them on the tendering of the CalMac services.<br><br>
I understand that Scottish Ministers will issue draft service specifications for the CalMac routes shortly. Those specifications will provide for a single tender for the whole route network. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand the importance of that. However, I am sure that he will also appreciate that as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
it is a matter for the Scottish Parliament, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in more detail on the specific aspects of the tendering exercise. I will comment further on the issue of EU legislation for which this House has responsibility. I note that there has been some. As Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, Mr. Hood, you are probably one of the greatest experts on this matter in the House. You probably understand all this better than anyone else in the Committee.<br><br>
There have been some objections to the necessity of tendering the CalMac services under the terms of the 1992 regulations. I should first state that the Government's and the Scottish Executive's legal advice refutes that position. Examples in other member states also bear that out. As the hon. Gentleman said, derogations were negotiated for several Mediterranean member states. They were, and are, intended to be only temporary measures. The derogations for Portugal, Spain and France expired in 1999. In those countries, relevant ferry and shipping services have all since been subject to open tendering exercises. The remaining derogation relates to Greece, and is due to expire in 2004. Following a series of tragic accidents in 2000, however, the Greek Shipping Minister at that time undertook to remove the derogation by October 2002.<br><br>
I do not get as many opportunities to travel overseas in this job as I did in my previous one, so however much I would love to take up the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute that I go to Brussels, I fear that on this occasion it would be likely to be a futile exercise. The hon. Gentleman has drawn comparisons in the past between the treatment of the proposed service from Ballycastle to Campbeltown and the freight facilities grant that was awarded to improve port facilities at Rosyth for the new service to Zeebrugge.<br><br>
I will clarify the Government's view, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand and appreciate it. The main purpose of financial support for both projects is to support policy aims that fall within devolved responsibilities. For the Ballycastle to Campbeltown service, the main purpose is local economic development, but for the port facilities at Rosyth, it is the environmental benefit of removing lorries from the roads. In both instances, Scottish Ministers requested that powers to pay grants be devolved to them. The Government have looked closely at the merits of each case and have agreed in principle to those requests. An order to devolve powers covering aid to the Ballycastle to Campbeltown service will shortly be laid before Parliament. Exchanges are also continuing on the detail of extended freight facilities grant powers for Scottish Ministers.<br><br>
In the case of Rosyth, Scottish Ministers requested that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions exercise his powers to pay grant under the Transport Act 2000 in advance of the devolution of powers to Scottish Ministers. That was in order to guarantee that works began on schedule. The cost of the freight facilities grant will be met from Executive resources
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
that will be transferred to the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions for that purpose.<br><br>
European Union legislation on maritime transport services is another example of the Government working in partnership with Scottish Ministers to deliver real benefits to Scotland. We will hear more examples this evening. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I will continue to do our utmost
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
to ensure that that partnership continues and develops.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute again for raising this important issue. I did not take up his offer to go to Brussels for reasons that I hope he will understand, but I hope that he will appreciate the Government's view. I also hope that I have moved the matter a step forward.</span></p>
