Drug Abuse</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first business is a statement on Government action to combat drug abuse. There is no time limit, but I am aware that many hon. Members want to speak in the main debate. Therefore, I ask that questions be brief; I cannot demand that answers be brief, but the Minister will have heard what I said. </span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Cabinet Office (Mr. Ian McCartney)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take up about 15 minutes of the Committee's time on what is, for me, a difficult subject to discuss in public.<br><br>
My father was joint Chairman of the Scottish Grand Committee between 1985 and 1987 and, for his sins, a Government Whip on the Committee during the 1970s. I have been taking his advice during the past few days on how I should handle the Committee; the phrase "kid gloves" came up on more than one occasion. It was always his ambition that I should speak at the Scottish Grand Committee. I represent an English constituency, but I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss such an important issue with Scottish colleagues.<br><br>
There should not be party-political differences on drug abuse, which has no regard for where people are on the political spectrum. Irrespective of political persuasion, drugs can hit any person, youngster, family or community. Unfortunately, as drugs have got a grip in the past two decades, the problem has hit every young person, family, community and politician. It is a major problem for society in general, and, for the sake of every child, parent and family, we are determined to do more to fight the drugs war.<br><br>
No constituency or community can consider itself safe from the dangers posed by drugs. Misuse causes misery to users and families; it weakens, damages and can even destroy communities. Drugs misuse stops many young people reaching their full potential in life; even for those who do not die, it destroys their potential, genes and capacity to achieve what they want. It has the ultimate capacity to kill, but it also wounds and damages. Drug addicts live an existence somewhere between life and death in the worst possible circumstances, and their families experience that too.<br><br>
Drug abuse fuels crime. Up to half of all property crime is drug-related, and research conducted in 1998 estimated that drug misuse cost United Kingdom society up to £4 billion per year through ill health, absenteeism, crime and associated social problems. The costs to individuals<i>—</i>wasted lives and lost opportunities—are beyond a price worth paying. We put the Government's anti-drug strategy in place as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
soon as we took office; we made tackling drug misuse a priority, not only for one Department, but across Whitehall. All Departments had the same priority; to tackle and challenge drugs, whatever their role. We all had to come to the table to reach an agreement<br><br>
The anti-drug strategy was not the No. 1 priority for the Home Office, but No. 5 for the Department of Health and No. 2 for the Department for Education and Employment; it was not the No. 1 priority for the Cabinet Office and the Scotland Office, but No. 2 or 3 in the Northern Ireland Office. It was our No. 1 priority.<br><br>
There was a need for a strategy that we could all buy into to meet the challenges of drug abuse with ferocity and commitment. In 1998, we published a 10-year strategy called "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain". We appointed the first UK anti-drugs coordinator, Keith Hellawell, to pull the strategy together and drive it forward. It is a 10-year strategy because we recognise the complexity of the problems and the need for a balanced and joined-up approach to combating drug abuse.<br><br>
The strategy has four key aims: to help our young people to resist drug misuse so that they can achieve their full potential in society; to protect our communities from drug-related, anti-social and criminal behaviour; to enable people with drug problems to overcome them and have a healthy, crime-free life style; and to stifle the availability of illegal drugs on our streets.<br><br>
The front line is not Shettleston in Glasgow, but Colombia, Afghanistan and Bolivia. It is wherever the poppies are grown and the drugs barons exist, although the drugs end up in our communities. The ability to stifle the availability of illegal drugs is critical to the other three pillars of the policy.<br><br>
The establishment of the Scottish Parliament saw many policy areas covered by the strategy—including prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and enforcement—pass to Edinburgh. That allows Scotland to respond to the needs that it identifies and to develop responses based on experience there. I am pleased that, like other devolved Administrations, the Scottish Executive remain fully signed up and committed to the overall strategy.<br><br>
The anti-drugs co-ordinator and officials from the Cabinet Office work closely with colleagues in the Scottish Executive. Keith Hellawell met the First Minister and Iain Gray on 19 February. They discussed various issues, including boosting the efforts and co-ordination of police activity across the border to make the lives of drug dealers and, more importantly, drug barons harder. I would have been at that meeting, but, unfortunately, I was a victim of flu. I look forward to re-arranging a meeting with the First Minister, Iain Gray and other colleagues, because it is important to co-ordinate matters at UK level. On this issue, we must live in each other's pockets; the Scottish Executive and I must work together. A drug baron does not pay regard to Afghanistan; why should he do so for Gretna Green? If we are to take those people on and be in their faces, we need to work together.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The co-ordinator is a member of the Scottish drug enforcement forum, bringing a UK and international dimension to the activities of the Scottish Executive. We can and must learn from one another's experiences. We are keen to share with our colleagues in the Scottish Executive our experience in improving treatment services and support for prisoners in England and Wales. Equally, those colleagues are building networks to share experience of good practice in schools, treatment and supporting communities. We need to learn from that because, in some instances, some people may be ahead of others. We are all involved in the same strategy, but there may be a local commitment, understanding and knowledge of the local background and history. England and Wales are slightly ahead of Scotland on some issues; Scotland is ahead of England and Wales on others. At any point in the 10-year plan, we must all work together, so that we do not waste or diminish our efforts to fight drugs.<br><br>
A number of initiatives in Scotland have certainly impressed me, and we will build on them this week. One example is the success of Scotland Against Drugs in engaging business in the fight against drugs. We need to be better at doing that throughout the UK. Scotland is a leading player. Engaging business is important not only in the UK; it is something for the rest of Europe to consider and build on. We are discussing with businesses how they can get involved in ridding communities and workplaces of drugs. They need to have a strategy that deals with workplaces, work forces, information and education, and an ethos to help people who have gone through a treatment programme, given up drugs and now want to enter the labour market. They must also recognise that there will be people in their workplaces who abuse drugs either daily or occasionally. There needs to be a strategy to deal with that.<br><br>
In fighting drugs, it is vital that we target those who make money from other people's misery, which is why we must all work together on a UK law enforcement strategy. That is why we are taking greater steps to recover the assets of those who profit from drug dealing. Our confiscated assets fund has been used to produce some good innovative work, to which I shall return later. We must do more to ensure that crime does not pay at community, regional, national or international level. No society can allow some people to be above the law, or to profit and survive with impunity on the backs of others who are suffering through drug abuse.<br><br>
The Home Secretary published the draft Proceeds of Crime Bill on 5 March this year. It will provide a hugely valuable addition to our weapons for fighting drug dealing. We want to deprive criminals of their ill-gotten gains, not only through the criminal justice system, but by introducing a civil recovery scheme. Over the past four years as a Minister—without being boastful, I have done many things—I have brought together all relevant aspects of Government and framed a proposal that the Home Secretary might take forward.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Our proposal changes the rules about how we as a society can effectively challenge those who use drugs to develop businesses in the community, to damage and control the community, to infiltrate legitimate businesses through ill-gotten gains, to prevent legitimate businesses from operating or to substantially damage our capacity to regenerate our communities. These people use drug money to drive the local economy. Legislation must put us on the side of our communities and against—or openly in the face of—those who want to destroy or manipulate them.<br><br>
We must remember that while these drug products kill people, the market has to be retained. For every young person killed, two, three, four or five more have to be recruited. There is always a risk of killing the people to whom they are selling drugs. Every child, young person and member of the community is vulnerable to the activities of drug barons. We must focus everything on taking them out and, through taking out the structure of their business, destroying their capacity to maintain their activities and to destroy our young people, wherever they are. It is a war that we must win. There can be no ifs or buts, and no squeamishness about it. To make our efforts more effective, we are going to give financial investigators greater powers.<br><br>
The proposed Criminal Assets Recovery Agency will investigate and remove offenders' wealth accumulated through criminal activity. It will make drug dealing far less attractive for the criminals who often keep their hands clean of the drugs from which they profit. The director of CARA will have the power to tax an individual, company or partnership where income, profit or gain is suspected—that is the important term—to have been derived from crime. The burden of proof shifts from the community and society to those involved in crime.<br><br>
New powers for financial investigators will help to trace and recover cash and goods derived from criminal activities. We will be able to restrain property at the start of a criminal investigation to avoid it being hidden away. By the time a judge imposes a sentence on someone found guilty of criminal activity, the criminal's resources have often gone outside the country and beyond the capacity of society to take back resources and use them for positive purposes. That is why it is important to take away assets when an investigation starts, rather than wait until the end. We are changing the nature of the game. No longer will criminals control the system; we will control it on behalf of the community.<br><br>
We are working closely with colleagues in Scotland to take this matter forward. We must ensure that there is effective UK coverage of the scheme and that there remains no financial hiding place in any part of the United Kingdom or offshore. The Scottish Executive and the Government must get this sensitive matter right and ensure that there are no loopholes for the criminals to exploit. I am confident that once the schemes are in place, they will have a great impact on those who profit from the miseries of others.<br><br>

The Government recognise the scale of the problems we face in tackling drug misuse; there are no simple, easy answers. Our aims are supported by major long-term investment to tackle the root causes of the drugs problem: for example, by drugs education in schools and targeted drug prevention measures to help those vulnerable young people who are most at risk; treatment for drug misusers both outside and within the criminal justice system to break the link between drugs and crime—research from the National Treatment Outcome Research Study shows that for every £1 spent on treatment, £3 is saved in criminal justice expenditure—and by concerted and targeted enforcement measures against drug traffickers and their assets.<br><br>
The Scottish Executive have at least matched the proportion of spend on anti-drug measures based on the Barnett formula. Hon. Members will be aware that it is for the Scottish Parliament to determine its spending in accordance with the needs of Scotland and Scotland's priorities. That the Executive have invested heavily in anti-drugs initiatives is evidence of their recognition of drugs as a high priority and shows their commitment to the overall strategy and to the people of Scotland.<br><br>
Against that substantial investment we have set tough targets: to halve the number of young people using class A drugs such as cocaine, heroin and LSD; to halve the level of repeat offending among drug misusers; to double the number of problem drug misusers in treatment; and to halve the availability of class A drugs. People say that that is foolhardy; I take a different view. We will never get on top of the problem unless we have ambition. The Government should not fear setting targets in areas where people may say, "Hands off, it's too difficult." For every day that we get nearer our targets, an individual and a community will have survived and we will be a day nearer putting behind bars those who have criminal businesses that undermine our society and our aims for it.<br><br>
Our 10-year strategy is underpinned by annual and three-year targets. These are monitored and reported on annually by the co-ordinator, whose report last year said that we were making good progress. However, no one would suggest that the war is over; we have won a few skirmishes and battles but, by God, we still have to win the war. The Scottish Executive have set their own more detailed targets and standards within the United Kingdom framework, which we support. With progress being monitored in detail, there is the capacity to change tack to ensure that stringent targets are met.<br><br>
I want to share one of the achievements of the law enforcement agencies in the past year. They have been able to prevent £1.2 billion-worth of class A drugs reaching the streets of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester and Liverpool, the villages of Aberdeenshire, Devon and Cornwall and anywhere else where there is a drugs problem. Just think what a devastating effect those drugs could have had on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
young people; yet that is only the tip of the iceberg. However, it shows that the 10-year plan is working. Five years ago, we could not have said how much was stopped; we could have said that nothing was being stopped. The process is working. For the first time, there is a change around; we are able to disrupt or destroy the route of drugs coming into the United Kingdom, but much more needs to be done.<br><br>
The Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency has seized more than £17 million-worth of drugs, with 116 strategic arrests in the past year. The same can be said of international activities, about which hon. Members may want to ask questions.<br><br>
I shall conclude by saying something about making communities safer and about the march on Sunday. We know that drugs are a threat to individuals and to communities; they lead to anti-social behaviour, crime and the fear of crime. Community leaders sometimes go about their business on behalf of their fellow citizens in fear of threats by drug dealers, drug-dealing gangs and drug barons. All too often, communities are ripped apart by drug dealers and get trapped in a downward spiral of decline and abandonment, as the Scottish Parliament's Social Inclusion Committee highlighted recently. The additional investment announced in the Budget can help communities to start to fight back. Ownership is important; communities must be given the financial and human resources to fight back against those individuals, gangs and businesses.<br><br>
The Government believe that drug misuse can be tackled and we have been tackling it. The evidence shows that we can make a real and measurable difference. We believe in setting targets to do that, and our positive investment in tackling the root causes of drugs will help to drive down the terrible costs and prevent harm to individuals, families and society. To achieve that, we must work together at international, national, regional and local levels. It is in our local communities and our streets that we see the damage that drugs cause to families and communities. I personally know about that.<br><br>
Communities can fight back and win, but they need our help. We cannot stand by and leave it to them. That is why I have changed my diary; I, and many others, will be in Glasgow this weekend to show our determination to beat the drug dealers by attending the <i>Daily Record</i> march against drugs.<br><br>
For my family, the march will be part of a long and thoughtful process, because it will bring back painful memories. It is very difficult to cope with loss, as all who have lost family members know. To lose a child is most difficult of all, because there are two losses to cope with; the loss of the child's life that was and the loss of the life that was to come. It is very difficult to deal with such loss, and even more difficult if one is in the public eye. I do not seek additional support because of that; it is simply a matter of fact. I happen to be in public life and the difficulty is magnified a thousand times. I am able to cope better because of the support that I have received in the House and outside.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Every letter that I receive is a reminder of the importance of trying to achieve something positive from a negative event in family life.<br><br>
The march is important. I discussed with my family whether, by going on the march, we could add something to it; not simply because I would be there, but because I would be there with my family, saying that other people matter, that children have been killed in the drugs war and that those children did not have a chance of survival. We are all diminished by their loss. We are marching to show solidarity, and not only with other families of victims. I hope that thousands of people whose lives have not been touched by drugs will turn out for the march. Not only those who have lost someone or have been damaged because of drugs should march; the entire community should turn out.<br><br>
The aim is not simply to march and then feel good about it. It is not just another campaign or another headline; if it were, it would not be worth the paper used to write about it. I hope that those who turn out for the march will work together. Perhaps the community in Scotland will be able to focus on the need to take action. We should not see those who are drug abusers as evil but as people with serious problems. They are our children. Every person in the statistics is someone's child, grandchild, niece or nephew. They are all human; they are all victims of a terrible war.<br><br>
I ask people to give an hour and a half of their time on Sunday to come on the march. If people are unable to do that, I ask them to take some time to think about how they might contribute. We should feel good about the thousands of children who might be saved by the march or by our 10-year strategy. For every action that we take, someone will not die or be damaged, and some family will not have to live in trauma for the rest of their lives because of the loss of a child.<br><br>
This is about human beings and communities. It is not only about emotion, but why not be emotional about our children? Why not be emotional about people who try to damage and destroy them? However, we must have heads as well as hearts. Perhaps the heart will come out on the march, but then we must focus on the head. The march should send a signal to all those in Scotland who want to damage and scar our communities and destroy our children for the sake of drug profit. The rules have changed. We say, "No more." If we get that out of the march, we can then truly hope that, over the next 10 years, the strategy will work positively. Next year, many families will be spared the agony of the death of a child. That is the bottom line. It is about saving lives and communities. I thank hon. Members for listening to my statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the Minister's personal commitment and his desire to tackle this major challenge. I welcome the fact that his father's ambition has come true and that we have the relevant UK Minister before the Grand Committee today. I welcome the powers of the draft Proceeds of Crime Bill. The key assurance that we seek from the Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
is that as we tackle this extremely important issue, the safeguards will be in place to ensure that people are innocent until proven guilty.<br><br>
Secondly, what research has his Department done into the costs of providing treatment versus the costs saved to society of not having to tackle all the associated crime and family disruption, once people have been successfully treated and taken away from crime? Finally, what work has his Department done to look at the wider issue of addictive behaviour and the damage that that does to individuals? Alcohol abuse is a scourge on society and individuals. What work has his Department done to look at some of the root causes of misuse, whether the drug is legal or illegal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said in my speech that the research so far shows that for every £1 spent on treatment, we save £3. There is much more behind that. As we go into the next decade of investment in public services, much of that investment will go into regenerating communities. Many of the communities that we need to regenerate are at the front line of the drugs war. One cannot reinvest in the housing and social environment of a community if the cancer of drug organisations controls what happens there. One cannot expect a community to deliver a modernising strategy and a new economy for its people and get them involved in social activities if all of that is stamped on by drug dealers. It is not just a question of the £1 and £3 to which I referred. Everything that we do to regenerate our communities must be predicated on damaging, disrupting and ultimately closing down the drug economy. If we do not do that, the regeneration resources that go into many of our communities will be dissipated.<br><br>
I share the hon. Gentleman's view about alcohol abuse. It is quite clear that the national treatment agency that we are establishing in April will deal exclusively in its first phase with drug abuse. However, it emerged from the consultation that a large proportion of antisocial behaviour relates to alcohol abuse. There is a correlation, which we should recognise. The Department of Health and the Home Office recognise that. Perhaps in its second phase the national treatment agency should also deal with alcohol issues. In advance of telling my colleagues in the Department of Health about that, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. He made a third point; I apologise that I did not make a note of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was about protecting the presumption of innocence until someone is proved guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the Proceeds of Crime Bill is incompatible with human rights. This is not an abuse of human rights. The Human Rights Act says that society is entitled not to be abused by criminal activity. We are talking about people who have more guns and arms than some of the terrorist organisations in Europe. These are tooled-up operations. In some parts of Britain, someone who wants to set up a taxi business will be burned out, as will anyone who wants

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
to run a club or a pub in some city centres. If a community leader says, "We don't want drugs here", their life can be threatened.<br><br>
A chap from the <i>Daily Record</i> wrote to me about a letter that it had published from a teacher who had stated what he wanted for his school. I was told that that teacher received death threats from drug dealers in the Gorbals, simply for stating his point of view. I think that we should change the rules and not be namby-pamby about it. I am in favour of the greater good, which must be the civil rights of those of us who do not want to damage and destroy our society.<br><br>
The biggest asset we have in society is the next generation. Anyone who gets in the way of helping society should have action taken against him. If that requires locking someone away, that is fine; if it means destroying their business, that is fine; if it means asking someone to explain why they have £50 million but are still claiming jobseekers allowance, that is fine. One of my constituents has just gone down for 14 years. He was on benefit and £250,000 was found when his house was raided. Such people should be asked, "How did you get this money?" If they cannot persuade us that they obtained it through legitimate means, we should redistribute it. That is an old socialist theory, but do not tell anyone that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Roy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell and Wishaw)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that the statistics for drug misuse in Scotland in 2000 tell us something about the age of the onset of drug misuse. Some 16 per cent. of those using drugs are under 15 years old, 47 per cent. are between 15 and 19, so 63 per cent. of those with drug problems are teenagers. What does the Minister think about people who ask for the decriminalisation of some drug? He might consider what that might do to cloud the judgment of teenagers who fight to uphold their street cred. Does the Minister agree that that would be a dangerous game to play with the minds of teenagers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly something that we can do without. We need to debate how we might provide our young people with the skills and knowledge that will enable them to resist drugs. Simply saying no does not always work. We live in a drug-orientated society, so it is important that we give people the skills and capacity to cope. If people use drugs, we must give them the resources to get them off drugs and keep them safe.<br><br>
I am sorry to say that two issues get mixed up when we discuss cannabis. Vulnerable people, such as multiple sclerosis sufferers, get exploited. There are drug dealers out there who are rubbing their hands together, because most dealers deal not in one drug, but in a basket of drugs. Cannabis is the gateway to other drugs, and if you decriminalise or legalise cannabis, young people will be turned on to class A drugs from the moment they come into contact with dealers. We must argue that legalising cannabis is not the way forward.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Some people may want to curl up and die and say that the drugs issue requires too much effort, so let us just legalise drugs. That is the view of some people, but it is not ours. Cannabis is a dangerous gateway drug and it has a long-term ill effect on health, even when other drugs are not used later. I know that a large proportion of people do not move on to other drugs, but a significant number do. The vast majority of those who use class A drugs say that cannabis was the first drug that they used, and that that introduced them to the drugs market.<br><br>
In respect of multiple sclerosis sufferers, the Government recognise that there is a case for medical research. Heroin is employed for medicinal uses and we need research to be carried out; trials are currently going on. We hope that by 2003–04 medicinal products that contain a cannabis derivative will be available. If the issues of medicinal and recreational use were separated, a more realistic and honourable debate about drugs in society could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Minister about the funding of voluntary agencies that battle against drugs.<br><br>
We have a serious drugs problem in Aberdeenshire, although it is not the most serious in Scotland, as is sometimes inaccurately reported in the press. A voluntary agency called Grampian Addiction Problem Services covers much of the area. Last year, its grant of £3,000 was cut by Aberdeenshire council. I accept that the council is cash-strapped, but that was a foolish decision. I have spoken to other voluntary agencies in Scotland that are under pressure in terms of funding. Instead of the expansion of the effort against drugs that is suggested by the Minister's announcement today, and by announcements in the Scottish Parliament, they see a cut in the funds that are provided for them to take part in the fight against drugs.<br><br>
Given the tenor of the Minister's remarks, I am sure that he accepts that voluntary community-based groups are one of the key weapons in fighting the drugs menace. Can he offer voluntary groups in Scotland some comfort and security with regard to funding, which they have not experienced in the past?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been personally involved in the arguments about resourcing such organisations. Huge resources are going into voluntary organisations. However, we do not fund them simply because they are voluntary organisations. There must be clarity about their objectives in working with Government and non-governmental agencies. We fund many organisations, voluntary and otherwise, and if they do not quite come up to scratch, we have to improve the vehicle or find other vehicles. If we do not have a strategy, the system will not work.<br><br>
As for the organisation to which the hon. Gentleman referred, I know that the local authority have had discussions with it about its strategy and activities. I do not know the organisation, so I cannot criticise it. If the Government's strategy was to say no in absolutely every circumstance, people might be left out of the game. We do not just say no—we have an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
inclusive and realistic strategy. Ultimately, we want people to stop using drugs, but in the meantime they need services in order to cope with their problem. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the organisation. I believe that it may receive more funding in future. The fact that there has been a change of funding in relation to that particular organisation does not mean that we are denying funding to those who deal with drug issues in Aberdeenshire. Aberdeenshire is a big area with a big problem. That has been recognised at every level in both rural and city communities.<br><br>
A huge new resource is there, and we need to get the voluntary organisations to work to an agreed strategy in utilising it. They must do that; there is no easy answer and no short cut.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I intend to start the debate at ten past 11.1 shall call as many hon. Members as I can before then, to ask brief questions and give brief answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join my right hon. Friend in congratulating the <i>Daily Record.</i> I pay tribute to its reporters and photographers, who have bravely exposed drug dealers in every community in Scotland. I ask him to ensure that the work of the Scottish Parliament in providing closed circuit television security cameras is reinforced. In Edinburgh last year, that resulted in 700 additional arrests for all sorts of crimes. In the nine multi-storey blocks in my constituency, where we now have 24-hour CCTV surveillance, the drug dealers have been driven out and those properties have become more desirable residences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have paid as much credit as I want to pay to the <i>Daily Record</i> in that respect. We all have our role to play, including the media. Frankly, my personal experiences with the media have sometimes been negative, but the fact that they have decided to change their approach is important. They are now targeting the people they should be targeting—not the victims of drug abuse, but those who have caused the disaster. I would be untrue to myself and my family if I said anything else. There is a history to this, and I am not prepared to let that lie. I congratulate the <i>Daily Record</i> on what it is doing, and others should be positive and join in the fight.<br><br>
The Government are investing huge sums in CCTV as part of their partnership agenda to tackle crime. However, we must ensure that we do not simply drive drug dealers from my hon. Friend's area to someone else's. Indeed, the purpose of the 10-year strategy is not to drive them from one area to another, but to stop them altogether.</span></p>

Oil and Gas Industry</div> <!-- title -->
<p>11.10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that the Committee do now adjourn. You have presided over this Grand Committee for many years, Mr. Maxton, and as you come to the end of your service in this House I am sure that few experiences have been more riveting than listening to today's statement by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Cabinet Office on drugs and drug abuse, which has focused the minds of members of all political parties on the evil of drugs in our society.<br><br>
I welcome this opportunity to discuss another aspect of Scottish life—the future of the oil and gas industry in Scotland. The debate is timely, as the industry is emerging from the problems it has experienced in the past two years. There can be no doubt about its importance to the United Kingdom economy, and, indeed, to Scotland. In the past 10 years, it has accounted for some 18 per cent. of industrial investment in the UK. Since the mid-1960s, it has invested some £190 billion in exploration and development of the UK continental shelf. Indeed, in the past year I have joined BP in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Forties field, which, when it first came on stream, was expected to last no more than a decade. The fact that it has prospered for so long is a tribute to the skills and creativity associated with extracting oil and gas from one of the most hostile fields in the world.<br><br>
The Scottish oil and gas industry has come a long way in developing the people and skills that are important to its continuation. Of the 270,000 people whom it currently employs directly and indirectly in the UK, some 116,000–7 per cent. of the Scottish work force—are in Scotland. That underlines the oil and gas sector's major contribution to the United Kingdom and the Scottish economy.<br><br>
However, it is fair to say that in recent years the industry has had to grapple with significant change, leading to the recognition that, if its future is to be secured, the challenges that lie ahead are as daunting as those of the past. After 30 years of activity, the North sea's oil and gas remain a valuable resource for Scotland and the UK. Now, the challenge is to take the industry global. The UK industry has great expertise in identifying and developing reserves in some of the world's most inhospitable environments. Such expertise can provide engineering solutions to the economically viable and environmentally sensitive recovery of previously unattractive fields. With partnership, those challenges can become opportunities.<br><br>
Some two years ago, when the drop in the price of oil to $10 a barrel coincided with a change in demand for heavy fabrication work, the industry and the Government faced a dilemma: whether to go ahead as before, lurching from problem to problem, or to take a radical look at how to secure the future of both the industry and the jobs associated with it. The result was a unique partnership between this Government and the industry in all its guises. The oil and gas industry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
task force, which was set up in January 1999, had a very specific remit: to develop strategies for reducing the cost base of UK oil and gas operations against the background of then historically low oil prices and the mature nature of the North sea field, to examine and prioritise initiatives for improving the competitiveness of the UK industry, and to recommend specific actions to be taken by the industry or by the Government. The aim was to establish common areas where significant improvements were still needed to enable the industry to compete in an intensely competitive world market, and to map a way forward that was both visionary and realistic. That aim led to the initiatives for improving competitiveness.<br><br>
The task force established the following vision for 2010:
<br><blockquote><p>"The UK oil and gas industry and Government working in partnership to deliver quicker, smarter and sustainable energy solutions for the new century. A vital UK Continental Shelf is maintained as the UK is universally recognised as a world centre for the global business."</p></blockquote>
The task force took the unusual decision to disband itself in favour of a new organisation, Pilot, which was charged with putting words into action. It is an example of co-operation between Government, operators, contractors and suppliers, and the trade unions. That is a model for Government and industry working in partnership.<br><br>
Pilot has a real job on its hands, because its targets are specific and focused. It aims to improve the competitiveness of the UK oil and gas industry and to encourage and provoke continuing exploration and development on the UK continental shelf. The task force defined the following targets: to sustain investment in UK continental shelf activity at £3 billion a year; to achieve a 50 per cent. increase in oil and gas exports by 2005; to get £1 billion additional value from new businesses; to support up to 100,000 extra jobs; and to produce the equivalent of 3 million barrels of oil a day. That will give the UK prolonged self-sufficiency in oil and gas.<br><br>
If we are to have any chance of meeting those targets, investment is needed. The recovery in oil prices has helped, but the impetus provided by Pilot has led to renewed commitment by operators, who openly acknowledge that. Investment spending in 2000 hit the £3 billion target, which was similar to the 1999 level. The survey of investment undertaken by the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association in September 2000 suggested that expenditure in 2001 could be nearer £4 billion. However, our analysis must be hard-headed. Some projects included in that figure are not fully confirmed, and oil companies must be frank with us about the investment that is going ahead. Oil companies' plans for the future are based on lower oil prices than current ones, so the projections are challenging.<br><br>
More than 40 per cent. of the investment is for drilling in existing fields, satellite developments and new fields. Most new field development will be sub-sea, using existing infrastructure. Significant new platforms will be few and far between. Although the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
problems of the fabrication industry require special attention, that should be focused on preserving existing jobs and activity.<br><br>
Operators' intentions suggest spending £12.5 billion in 2001–2004, £3.5 billion of which—roughly 28 per cent.—has already been sanctioned. Companies are making positive assumptions about new technology, lower costs and oil prices. That is sensible and welcome, but, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in the Budget statement, we want investment intentions to become projects on the ground, not a wish list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What might the Government do, in partnership, to stimulate exploration? There has been a severe drop during the past two or three years, and only a very small recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, to which I will return. One advantage of Pilot is that we have had an opportunity to talk frankly with the industry without using the megaphone diplomacy of the past. We have discovered what the industry needs to encourage exploration. There are, of course, additional macro-economic issues. OPEC and other oil producers have a role to play in creating and maintaining demand for oil and gas. I shall consider the specific issues in a moment.<br><br>
Last September, BP and Shell announced major investment plans. BP announced a £650 million United Kingdom continental shelf investment programme for 2000, and forecast continuing rising capital investment over the next three years. On the same day, Shell indicated that capital expenditure for developments operated by Shell UK Exploration and Production in the North sea in 2001 would increase by 50 per cent. compared with its original plans, which is encouraging news. The projected figure of £820 million represents an increase of about 20 per cent. on actual expenditure in 2000.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) asked about further exploration. Shell has indicated that it plans to double its spend on seismic exploration, with several new technologies being deployed, which is a further indication of confidence. Last Thursday, TotalfinaElf confirmed its £145 million Otter oilfield development. The company has awarded contracts that will immediately benefit Aberdeen, Dunfermline and Evanton on the Cromarty firth, and there has been a raft of other similar announcements.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the Government are partners in that and we are helping to encourage investment. Compared with other countries, we continue to have a relatively generous oil taxation regime, and we want to ensure that it continues to balance the need to raise a fair share of revenue against the simultaneous need to promote long-term investment in the North sea. Receiving firsthand information from the oil and gas industry task force and Pilot has helped our understanding of the industry, and it has also meant that the industry has been able to receive direct messages from the Government about our intentions.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the Secretary of State see the balance between the large and small oil companies in future development and investment? In particular, will she tell us what has happened to the Nova Technology Fund project?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes several good points, some of which I am about to address. In relation to Nova, which is a venture capital development, I was reshuffled too quickly to the Scotland Office. I was about to hand over the first Nova cheque, but my feet were moving in other directions. Nevertheless, developments are coming in that area. New business and small companies are also important, and I shall discuss them in a moment.<br><br>
We introduced capital gains rollover relief for oil licences in July 1999. That was welcomed by the industry, which had made representations about the matter, because it helps companies to consolidate their position in the North sea and encourages more efficient exploration of oil and gas fields.<br><br>
Investment and exports are a twin-pronged strategy. We must encourage companies—especially those in the supply chain—to think globally. In the supply chain we have companies, some of which are small, that are world leaders. The international market for the supply chain is worth about £200 billion a year— although not all that is open to international bidding. Already UK exports are worth roughly £3 billion, with one third of UK supply companies being active overseas. The Government have a substantial team in Trade Partners UK that is trying hard to promote the mutual benefits not only for major oil companies but for UK suppliers.<br><br>
We have been proactive in pursuing UK interests abroad. The Prime Minister recently announced a major win for AMEC on the Bonga project in Nigeria, which will bring £300 million of fabrication work to the UK. Most of the work will be based in AMEC's yard on the Tyne, but there should be knock-on benefits for the supply chain throughout the UK. We want more export business coming to Scotland, because our oil and gas industry has the skills and technology to be a major force in world markets. We must work hard to reach the task force target of a 50 per cent. increase in orders.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh) asked about new businesses. The world is changing. The heavy platforms used extensively in the North sea in the past are not as much in demand now. Fabrication companies have had to look to different kinds of work to survive and, sadly, not all of them have managed to do so. We remain determined to give what help we can in the quest for new work and diversification. Indeed, the DTI's fabrication support group, under the auspices of Pilot, continues to meet quarterly to coordinate activity and to ensure a joined-up response. We have seen some progress in that regard, not least through BARMAC's decision to use its dry dock at Nigg to allow work on drilling rigs.<br><br>
Last week my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe launched a new business CD-ROM detailing the opportunities available to the oil and gas industry in the areas of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
diversification and the environmental sector. About 6,000 companies will receive that CD-ROM, and a series of events around the United Kingdom, including Aberdeen, will publicise not only the CD-ROM but the findings of the two recent studies that it contains. That is an important and worthwhile step towards encouraging and helping UK companies into new markets. There are a wide range of new markets for waste management, environmental monitoring and instrumentation, oil waste and wastewater management. They are real markets, with real money. In terms of new opportunities, we want companies to look at renewable energy, transport infrastructure and logistics, and downstream gas distribution. Much of that work is important not just for our economy but for our environment. When I was in Inverness last week, I was happy to visit Wavegen, one of the exciting new companies developing wave technology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is talking about renewable energy. Does she agree that oil companies are in a good position to develop large-scale renewable energy sources? I think that she opened the Blyth offshore wind farm last year. That is a worthwhile way forward, but I also wonder whether she would support smaller initiatives such as those on the island of Isla, which has been developing wave energy since 1994. It hopes to develop much more and become self-sufficient. I understand that the European Union has also committed itself to finding 100 communities, including islands, in which renewable energy can be developed. I hope that the Secretary of State supports such initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes a very important point. I know that there are great opportunities in her constituency for renewable energy. The rural parts of Scotland are an excellent test-bed for renewable energy. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Minister of State is visiting Isla tomorrow and will see the renewable energy project there. The hon. Lady is right about the need to encourage large as well as small companies to look at renewable energy, which is why the Government have given electricity suppliers a 10 per cent. renewables obligation—to take the renewable energy industry from the margins into the mainstream. Renewable energy provides significant opportunities.<br><br>
As well as renewables, we must look at existing oil and gas supplies, to make sure that fallow fields and fields that should have been developed but have not, are taken fully into account. The latest DTI survey of exploration and appraisal drilling shows significantly increased intent to drill wells over the next three years compared with the previous two surveys—which means that the industry has greater confidence in UK potential. Good progress is being made in the undeveloped discoveries work group, which goes back to the hon. Gentleman's point about looking to undeveloped discoveries when we evaluate discoveries, which have greatly increased over the past year. We must do what we can to tap some of the potential 6 billion barrels of oil not in production.<br><br>

There has been a raft of other initiatives, about which I shall not go into detail. LOGIC—Leading Oil and Gas Industry Competitiveness—is an industry-funded organisation working its way through the supply chain. The small firms sector at the high technology end of the industry is an important sector, which has been given a boost through the industry technology facilitator. Much of the high-tech development in the United Kingdom oil and gas industry relates directly to small firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At a meeting with constituency businesses last Friday, the Federation of Small Businesses told me that small companies face a challenge in protecting their patented and intellectual property when they go abroad. Is there not a role for the Government to provide some back-up for that protection?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The industry technology facilitator is considering that. The issue is not so much protecting a patent, but getting through the doors of companies that have traditionally had their own procurement structures and do not allow access for the new technologies. We must work jointly on the patent front and there are proposals for a European Community patent which should help those industries, but we must batter down the doors to provide access to those major companies.<br><br>
For the future, we have seen an encouraging response to the 19th round of offshore licensing and 13 applications were received before the deadline on 27 February. The industry has looked forward to that. There is now development around the Faroes with real opportunities for companies. The combination of the licensing rounds, the rolling programme of fallow field initiatives, with increased investment intentions, should lead to a significant increase in exploration and development in the near future.<br><br>
The partnership approach is paying dividends. The oil and gas industry is already producing excellent examples of new ideas and initiatives. We are seeing the sharing of knowledge on new technologies, improving communication throughout the supply chain, facilitation of asset trading technologies and commercial co-operation. That is enabling access to previously undeveloped fields.<br><br>
We are doing well in maintaining a strong United Kingdom continental shelf production base. That is concrete evidence of progress, but there is no room for complacency. The industry has the opportunity to build on its excellent reputation and gain a strong foothold in new markets both here and all over the world. The Government remain determined to help the industry to maintain and build on its international reputation. However, as I said earlier, promises of production, investment and development are not enough. We want to see the activity on the ground. The United Kingdom continental shelf and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
employment generated by it have a significant part to play in the United Kingdom economy and, in partnership, we can make it work.</span></p>
<p>11.32 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Secretary of State to the Scotland Office and her new role. In previous Scottish Grand Committee meetings, we have asked for the appropriate United Kingdom Minister to attend, and in the past we might have asked why the Minister with responsibility for energy was not present for a debate such as this. However, the Secretary of State has recently moved from that job, so she is up to speed, although she did not hand over that last cheque. If the Scottish Grand Committee continues, perhaps the Government will remember our request for the appropriate United Kingdom Minister to attend, as happened with the statement, which was most welcome.<br><br>
The Secretary of State was praised on Monday when I attended the Shell Livewire awards for entrepreneurs for business start-ups in Aberdeen. Shell's spokesman said that the way in which industry now works together in this country is unique, and he welcomed that development. Some of us see that as a silver lining to a cloud that should not have existed. When the Government first came to power and the Chancellor's understanding of the industry was less than perfect, he was about to hit the industry with a windfall tax, which would have been devastating. Lessons have been learned, but we must keep those lessons alive and not forget them.<br><br>
I must declare an interest as the vice-chairman of the all-party group on the offshore oil and gas industry, which is a constituency interest because many of my constituents work in the industry or are affected by it. We must not forget that this is a people business, with many people working out of sight offshore as well as onshore in the United Kingdom. The North sea is a hostile environment and is challenging physically, which has led to greater expense but also greater safety demands.<br><br>
It is some time since the Piper Alpha incident, but we must not forget it. Many safety lessons have been learned, but the concept of a safety culture is to keep that alive. I remember listening to the midnight news that night. The BBC reporter, in that careful BBC way, got it across that there was a major disaster in the North sea before it had been confirmed. He was trying not to scaremonger but it sounded extremely dramatic. I lived on the flight path of the helicopters, and as the airport is normally shut at night, it was clear that a major incident was going on in the North sea because so many helicopters could be heard overhead. We must not forget the challenges that people face.<br><br>
A lot has been learned in that safety culture and there have been many extremely welcome benefits. Portlethen air training corps held a fundraising event at the weekend, thanks to the hospitality of the Robert Gordon's Institute of Technology survival centre in Aberdeen. I went to hand out certificates, but I also found myself taking the plunge at a practice
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
abandonment from a platform. It was certainly realistic. The lights were turned off, the waves and the wind machine were turned on and there were sounds of raging storms. After putting on a survival suit and life jacket one had to leap off a 10 ft platform and try to get into a life raft.<br><br>
Such training is important because when it happens for real it is not a complete shock. It is not nearly as dramatic as it would be in real life but at least people get those instincts behind them. A friend who was involved in a helicopter crash in the North sea found the experience crucial when the helicopter turned over. He had to remain belted into his seat while the helicopter went over and under the water and then wait for everything to become still before getting out. Without any practice it would be extremely difficult to remain calm and confident.<br><br>
The safety issue came to a head in a public way when BP came up with its Jigsaw proposals. Much of it is water under the bridge now, as it has decided to develop those proposals in a more measured way, involving consultation and observation. That is extremely welcome. Concern has been expressed about how the safety regime is carried out case by case, without an overall strategy. The lesson of Piper Alpha is that it is important to maintain safety platform by platform, but we should see where overall support can be given to co-ordinating rescue work, should that be needed.<br><br>
I was at the AMEC yard some time ago with the all-party group. We saw how the industry had started to import the extremely good offshore safety culture into onshore industries. There is a lot to be learned from what has been done there. Promoting safety offshore is not just a cost and a burden, as it is seen by some. An efficient permit-to-work culture provides a more efficient and productive working environment. There is more control over what is happening and greater understanding of the interface between the different operations offshore. One contractor told me that he was thinking about moving into rail maintenance and taking that safety culture on to the railways. That was an extremely welcome idea.<br><br>
The unions talked about the pace of implementing the working time directive. Perhaps the Minister could give us some idea of how that is progressing. I spoke to the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee and the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The AEEU mentioned that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 do not seem to apply offshore. If a contractor with both offshore and onshore employees is transferred to another owner, there is protection for those working onshore but not for those working offshore. I would welcome any advice on that.<br><br>
As the Minister said, the UK continental shelf has made a major contribution to the UK economy, with about £170 billion of offshore taxes paid since the 1970s. We should pay tribute to that industry's financial contribution to our well-being as a society, not just through taxes, but through all the onshore employment. It took the rest of the country longer to recognise that; in the north-east, we saw jobs for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
contractors and in business parks on our doorsteps. Those jobs extend throughout the United Kingdom; the Liberal Democrat spokesman on small business worked for a company in the south of England that was involved in coating cables that were destined for the North sea. We must keep at the forefront of our minds the fact that North sea industry underpins much manufacturing activity in our economy.<br><br>
On Friday, I visited Badentoy industrial estate in my constituency for a networking lunch that was organised by Kincardine and Deeside enterprise trust. Some 2,500 people work on that estate, and, as we drove around it, the owner pointed out a pipe yard that seemed to extend over the horizon. He said, "They tell me the industry is in a downturn but, if you look at all the piping, you have to recognise that there is still a lot of life left in it". That is why we must all resist the siren call for a windfall tax. Such a tax is extremely tempting, especially when many constituents who are not involved in the oil industry face rising fuel prices. Obviously, it is also tempting for a Government—who play a big part in increasing those prices through taxation at the pump—to see the industry take some blame, although OPEC is at the root of the underlying commodity price. There is a double-edged sword for our economy: we do not want too low a price for oil, because we would lose all the investment in the North sea, or too high a price, because of the damage that it would do to our non-oil economy.<br><br>
The smaller, independent companies brought the situation home to me. They are not involved in petrol retail and make all their profits in production and exploration. They defended some of the major companies' profits, because both make profits in production and exploration when the price is high, rather than in the retail end of the sector. That is an important to message to remember when the siren voices propose a windfall tax. The windfall tax would not take money out of the retail sector, which does not make much money; it would take money out of exploration and production. If money were taken from companies by taxation in that hostile and expensive industrial environment, it would make it more attractive for them to take their investment overseas to more welcoming countries. The smaller independents say that they make losses in the bad years and build up capital for investment in the good years. It is a long-term industry, with massive swings and turnover.<br><br>
The real challenge that we face is recruitment and the skills shortage. If there had not been a collapse in the oil prices, there would have been a barrier to growth in the North sea anyway in terms of finding the skilled work force to provide the next generation to work offshore. We must get the message across at universities and schools that the industry has a long-term future and that it is well worth going into it. I remember a friend at university entering the oil industry because he decided that it had enough time left in it for him not to have to think later about a career move. It is a challenge to name many businesses about which one could still think that. We must get the message across that there is plenty of life left in the North sea.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
The Government also have a role to play. Judging from my postbag, the Treasury's idea of the IR35 taxation reform for self-employed people has tempted many people to look abroad for work. I met accountants on Friday who said that many of their clients face a challenge in April to work out which side of the fence they sit on that tax reform. It will bring new bureaucracy into an industry in which we are trying to recruit and encourage innovation.<br><br>
The industry must take some lessons on board. If it is trying to recruit, it must understand that the way in which it treats people in downturns is important when attracting them to return. Many people who were lost in the downturns have found a different life style and a new way of working, and are not ready to return to the industry. As the Minister said, small developments are crucial to the future of the North sea. I have also been told that the Government need to examine their petroleum revenue tax on tie-backs to traditional platforms, which might be as much as 70 per cent.<br><br>
As the Minister rightly said, not many—if any— new heavy platforms will be built, but the existing ones are crucial to the North sea. The decommissioning of any major platform in the North sea would wipe out a whole area of small field development, because there would not be the major infrastructure to support smaller fields, and the costs would become prohibitive. It is crucial to maintain the major fields in production, to allow the smaller fields to be developed and encourage the fallow fields to come on line.<br><br>
As the Minister said, because of the challenges in the North sea, we are at the forefront of developments in new technology and have a worldwide market available to us. Being at the forefront, we have much to offer in respect of exports. I hope that the Minister will examine patents further.<br><br>
Diversification is important. Part of the peace dividend is that the Ministry of Defence is much less protective of how it gains its contracts and much more willing to buy off the shelf. North sea skills are transferable into Ministry of Defence contracts. Two companies in my constituency have done well out of the Ministry's greater willingness to take commercial off-the-shelf solutions to problems. One aspect of the Minister's current efforts is a CD-ROM to link people with the Ministry of Defence.<br><br>
Greenpeace raised issues about renewables, particularly offshore wind, which is reliable and benefits from a much more stable generating capacity. It also makes planning easier, as it is often out of sight, so developments do not directly affect constituents. Greenpeace may have neglected to pay tribute to the industry for the switch to gas and electricity generation, which has made a major contribution to CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emission reduction.<br><br>
Greenpeace is right about the need to tackle carbon emissions, but it would be cutting off our nose to spite our face to end our own North sea production in order to buy imports or allow the industry to go elsewhere to produce. That is Greenpeace's mistake. The national grid is one of the main barriers to renewables. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Government must examine the structure of the electricity industry to find ways of improving the grid in order to take renewable energy back to its customers.<br><br>
The local economy of my constituency and others in the north-east of Scotland is distorted by the oil industry. People who do not work in the industry face much higher housing costs because of the extra rewards of those who do work in it. Traditional industries also face many extra costs in trying to recruit in competition with the oil industry. Although we benefit from this economically vibrant and productive industry on our doorstep, we must nurture other industries in order to secure a diversified economy for the future.<br><br>
The industry has a long future—a crucial message— with 120 fields potentially available for development. With the right attitude from the Government and cooperation from the industry, north-east Scotland, Scotland as a whole and the rest of the United Kingdom will have a secure long-term future.</span></p>
<p>11.48 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Anne Begg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As an Aberdeen Member, I am pleased to participate in this debate on the future of the oil and gas industry. As the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) said, the industry is crucial to the northeast. Many of my constituents either work directly in the industry or their jobs are dependent on it.<br><br>
I agree with the Secretary of State that prospects for the oil and gas industry did not look so good two years ago. That is putting it mildly. We were worried that we might see the end of oil and gas in the North sea. Oil companies were talking about a new average price for oil and gas of about $10 a barrel. At that level, the North sea could just have survived on existing reserves. If the price dropped to $8 a barrel it would no longer be economic. It jogged along at $12 a barrel, but needed to be above $15 or $16 a barrel to justify new exploration.<br><br>
Ironically, the north-east was relieved when the price of oil went up. It was not popular elsewhere, but the more cerebral of my constituents whose jobs are dependent on development in the North sea were pleased and relieved when oil was $30 a barrel, because that unblocked future exploration, production and development.<br><br>
In her previous role as Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, the Secretary of State was in Aberdeen so often last summer at celebrations such as that for the BP Forties field and the opening of Amerada Hess's new field that we started to think of her as Minister for Aberdeen. Since then, work in the North sea has increased, and this year investment will be £4 billion.<br><br>
My constituents, who two years ago saw a black future for the oil and gas industry, are much happier now. However, the key is whether the drillers are happy, because that suggests new exploration work in the future. I can report that the drillers are as happy as drillers ever can be.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Reserves in the North sea are still remarkably high and there is a long-term future—some predict another 30 years—for the oil and gas industry. That may not seem a long time compared with other industries, but 30 years ago it was predicted that the industry would last only 20 years, yet there are still reserves that will last for 30 more years. There are as many known reserves now that have not been developed or exploited as there were 20 years ago. The oil is there to be extracted, but that is becoming more difficult and the larger fields, such as Forties, do not exist any more.<br><br>
Thanks to Government help, new initiatives have helped smaller oil companies to develop fields that the larger companies consider uneconomic. For example, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was present at the opening a few weeks ago of the new Talisman building in my constituency. The top of the building is lit with green lights and it stands out as a beacon of hope for the future of the oil and gas industry. It is part and parcel of the Aberdeen skyline.<br><br>
Talisman, which started as a small company, is now a major player in the North sea. One reason why it could develop was the announcement by the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry of a royalties remission on the new Beatrice field, which Talisman took over from BP. It was a win-win situation for the Government, because although they missed out on royalties, the field would not have been developed if they had not given that extra tax relief. Now that the field has been developed, they collect corporation and other relevant taxes, and there are 700 more jobs in the North sea, many of which have been taken by my constituents.<br><br>
The Secretary of State mentioned the sterling work of the oil and gas task force, which has now been replaced by Pilot. Safety is certainly an issue in the North sea.<br><br>
I make a plea to the Government to encourage even smaller companies to get involved in the development or recovery of fields abandoned by larger companies. One telling statistic is that, even on abandonment, there may be unrecovered reserves of 50 per cent. or more. Some companies are willing to take that on. They do not have huge overheads but they are looking for some kind of tax help. The roll-over tax relief certainly helped, but that was on exploration. I hope that the example of Talisman and the remission on royalties may be a way of encouraging small companies to take over the assets of larger companies and develop them in a way that the larger companies would be unable to do.<br><br>
The key to all that will be partnerships between the Government and the industry and between the industry and those who work in the area of safety. As the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said, safety is crucial. There are worries about development and safety issues in the North sea. I hope that Pilot will continue to consider those issues and that the Health and Safety Executive's role will be strengthened to ensure that those who work in this dangerous occupation are fully protected and that any incidents are fully reported and not swept under the carpet.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
The oil industry in the North sea is doing so well because this Government have provided a stable fiscal regime. When they came to power, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor considered the fiscal regime and took advice from the industry, and those of us from the north-east who advocated leaving well alone. I think that that coincided with the low oil price. With that background of stability, the oil companies have a responsibility to ensure that they put investment back into the North sea, protecting and creating the jobs that we want so much.<br><br>
I would worry about the oil and gas industry's future if we did not have a Labour Government. The average annual tax take from sea oil revenues during the 1990s was about £2.1 billion. I have figures for 1998–99 and 1999–2000, when the tax take was £2.5 billion and £2.6 billion respectively. The spending deficit in Scotland—the difference between what it raises in taxes and what it spends—is almost £5 billion. In the unlikely event that the SNP wins power and we have an independent Scotland, there would be an almost £2.5 billion shortfall even if all the North sea revenues were included as part of the Scottish budget. That would create instability in the North sea. People would certainly be looking over their shoulder to see how that £2.5 billion would be made up. For the sake of the North sea oil industry's future, I am hopeful that, come the election—we do not know when it will be—people in the north-east will realise that they are better off with Labour.</span></p>
<p>11.58 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to rise to the bait, but I will say to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) that the last time that we debated oil in a Grand Committee in Edinburgh—I remember it quite well—she seemed convinced that oil prices would be in the basement for the foreseeable future. She seemed to regard that as a reason to attack the Scottish National party. Now that the oil price is $25 a barrel, she has found another reason to attack us. Whether oil prices are down or up, there is no pleasing some people.<br><br>
To be serious, if the hon. Lady glances at the Budget report, she will see that the forecast from the Government—which must be correct—is that oil revenues will be £6 billion, £6.2 billion, £5.4 billion, £5.7 billion and £4.8 billion over the next five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Begg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made my point for me; there is no stability in the price of oil. To base the whole future of a country on the amount of revenue that people think that they might get at some time in the future would be extremely foolhardy, because the oil price is incredibly volatile and could go down just as easily as it has gone up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Lady has raised that matter, to which I shall return in addressing how the future can be secured. I speak for Scotland, but my remarks could apply to the United Kingdom. This year, the surplus of revenue on expenditure for Scotland is over £2 billion; next year, on the Government's forecast, it will be more than £4 billion.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
The documents to which the hon. Lady refers are some two years old and date from a time when the United Kingdom Treasury was in substantial deficit. As we know, that has changed.<br><br>
I hope that it will not cause the Secretary of State too much surprise or damage if I say that I approve of the Pilot initiative, for two reasons. The first is that it is, in my experience, probably the first Government initiative to look at the oil and gas industry not as a here-today, gone-tomorrow industry that will last 20 or 30 years but as something that will, if the correct policy decisions are made, last well into the future. Policy decisions are obviously only part of that perspective, but they could be enforced. I very much approve of the ambitious targets that were set out in the Pilot initiative. I approve of the production targets and the jobs targets. I also particularly approve of seeing oil and gas as a long-term industry that will be produced in significant quantities from around the Scottish coast 50 years from now.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine was at university, he weighed up whether he could have a full career in oil and gas or whether he should waste his time in the House of Commons or with Liberal Democrat politics; he eventually plumped for politics, but I am sure that he would have been an ornament to the oil and gas industry if he had chosen to enter it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The advantage of being in politics is that one can help all those who chose a career in the oil and gas industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that I used to earn a very bare crust working in the industry in the 1980s, but that colours my experience. Even at that time the dominant view in the Treasury was that it was a short-term milch cow industry from which as much revenue as possible could be grabbed as quickly as possible because it would not be there in the 1990s, never mind in the next millennium. That is why I welcome the Pilot initiative. I shall come to questions about aspects of the Pilot initiative and what areas the Minister thinks have been successful.<br><br>
The second reason that I welcome Pilot is because it overtook the oil and gas industrial taskforce, particularly the oil taxation review, which—it is only fair to remind the Secretary of State—was an intensely damaging experience over the 18 months of uncertainty from the 1997 general election. I disagree with the position of the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that one should never change oil taxation, but one should not change oil taxation or appear to be about to change it at a time of low oil prices. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Oil prices were low and declining at that time and that is not a good time to change oil and gas taxation or add to the uncertainty that was already substantially affecting the industry.<br><br>
In the past, Conservative Governments have changed oil taxation. The biggest change and tightening of oil taxation was in 1980 when the Government of Baroness Thatcher—having taken
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
over the taxation regime from the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn)—vastly increased it. In other words, the Conservative party decided to tax more than the right hon. Member for Chesterfield. It was done against a background of very strong oil prices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why do oil companies seem to value the advice of Conservative Members when one considers how much damage the Conservative Government did to the industry over so many years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates that the election is upon us. I am sure that there is general sympathy with his reasonable points. I am also sure that neither he nor I has ever been a consultant in the oil industry in any shape or form.<br><br>
The Chancellor again opened up the possibility of changing taxation in this year's Budget. I hope to hear from the Secretary of State that any taxation changes will support the objectives of the Pilot initiative, which reinforced the trend that the Secretary of State took forward during her time at the Department of Trade and Industry in setting key objectives. The taxation regime should take account of the objectives that have been set for the industry.<br><br>
What progress has been made with respect to undeveloped discoveries and the identification of 350 potential discoveries, and the satellite accelerator and marginal fields? The Nova technology fund has been mentioned, and we heard that the Secretary of State had been about to present a cheque. How many other cheques have been presented, if any, by the Secretary of State or her successor? What are the tax implications of the industry technology facilitator and the cluster idea of small fields combining into larger fields?<br><br>
In terms of sustaining development and viewing the industry as one of the future, and not of the past—or even of the present only—is the Chancellor reviewing the taxation regime so that he can grab yet more billions from the North sea, or is he reviewing it to make changes that would reinforce the objectives that have been set by Pilot?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Begg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way. I will make my other points quickly. If the hon. Lady still wishes to intervene, she might do so later.<br><br>
I wish to ask the Secretary of State about progress in relocating the oil directorate jobs to Aberdeen. In the early 1990s, I was a member of the Energy Select Committee that produced a report that was instrumental in persuading the then Minister for Energy to transfer an initial tranche of jobs to Aberdeen. Sixty jobs were transferred at that time. The Library told me that the establishment in Aberdeen now comprises 72.3 posts, so progress has been made. There are still 101 jobs in London, some of which are in sectors that the Secretary of State identified as critical for the future development, particularly at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
national level, of the directorate's work. What is the possibility of a further transfer of positions to Aberdeen?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue of moving jobs to Aberdeen is one that the Government are interested in promoting. There are 217 people in the division that is centred in Aberdeen, but only 81 of them are located there. However, relocation is continuing. We must allow people an opportunity to make arrangements. I understand that a press release was issued yesterday about the HSE's involvement in Aberdeen as a centre of the UK oil industry. The hon. Gentleman made a good point. The deputy director is already in Aberdeen, and the director is about to relocate. The programme is rolling out over time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that answer. I remember evidence that came from the former Department of Energy eight years ago; it seemed to equate the prospect of moving to Aberdeen with going to the north pole. We heard evidence from a civil servant who suggested that it would be awkward because the commute back to London at the weekend would be somewhat difficult. That was not the idea behind the move.<br><br>
The Secretary of State will appreciate that the significance of the relocation is not the number of jobs moved but the message to the industry as to where the oil and gas centre is located and the knock-on effect on private sector jobs, as we have seen in oil provinces around the world. I hope that that progress will be accelerated, particularly in the areas that the Secretary of State identified as important for the future development of oil and gas.<br><br>
My last point concerns sustaining the huge endowment effect of oil and gas revenues into the far future, not just the foreseeable future. I was interested by the remark that revenue of approximately £170 billion has flowed into the Treasury during the last 20 years. That is about £32,000 for every man, woman and child in Scotland. Such are the revenues that have flowed into the Treasury in that time.<br><br>
In the early 1980s, when oil revenues brought in substantial funds, a debate was initiated on how to ring-fence such revenues to ensure that the benefit impacted on the country as a whole. Many suggestions were made, none of which was put into practice. Although Labour Members will say that oil revenues have been used wisely in the past three or four years, most of us would argue that the advantage and opportunity afforded have been allowed to dissipate through the 1980s and 1990s.<br><br>
We should consider the working model that has been developed in Norway in the past five years. In the mid-1990s, the Norwegian Government decided to set up a specific oil investment fund—one might call it a fund for future generations—anticipating a time when the Norwegian sector runs dry and generates no more revenues. It is worth spending a couple of minutes considering the fund's progress since 1995. It is now worth 370 billion kroner, or £30 billion. That is only a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
proportion of the revenues invested, but it is equivalent to 33 per cent. of Norwegian gross domestic product.<br><br>
The key outcomes of the Norwegian experience are staggering. The income earned from the fund in 1999 was equivalent to a real annual return of more than 11 per cent. The average return in the three years to 1999 was 9 per cent. Importantly, the total value of the fund will overtake that of remaining reserves by 2006, and has already overtaken Government revenue from oil itself. In just a very few years, the Norwegian experience has shown that setting aside a proportion of oil revenues in a fund for, say, future generations, can within 10 or 15 years yield greater revenues and earnings than those from oil itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Begg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying. By his own admission, projections for the Scottish budget and oil revenues are attributable to the Chancellor's good stewardship of the UK economy. In response to my earlier intervention, he said that the figures that I cited are two years old and that things have improved since then. Indeed, they have improved enormously, so why risk changing that winning formula?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must forgive me if I do not attribute as much of the improvement in public finances to the Chancellor's wizardry as she does. She will expect me to wonder whether it was the wisest thing in the world for the Chancellor to apply Tory limits on public expenditure in his first two years in office, given the resulting damage to the health service that is visible in her constituency and mine.<br><br>
I was trying to answer the hon. Lady's point about how to secure the benefit of this vast natural resource not just for 10 or 20 years but for all time, and the Norwegian experience shows a way forward. The idea is not new—it was considered in the 1980s—but the example of Norway shows that it can work extremely well. A fund for future generations is an idea whose time has come. It is a way to secure the benefits not for a single generation but for all generations. The Government would be wise to understand that they will not be easily forgiven if they yet again accumulate in the London Treasury money generated by the upswing in oil prices and revenues, without looking at the long-term benefits for Scotland and its people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span> <i>rose—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am grateful to the hon.

If they keep their remarks brief, I can fit them all in.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate, focusing on the downstream activities in oil and gas in the fabrication
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
industry. That is important in my constituency, which is home to what was one of the largest fabrication companies in the UK: Barmac. Last year was one of the leanest on record for downstream construction work, and there were many job losses at Barmac. That has been a tragedy for our skilled work force, and has also affected the local economy in an area that has a gross domestic product well below the European average.<br><br>
With representatives of the trade union movement and with local authorities, I have been involved in a campaign for Barmac that is quite different from that of the early 1990s. The focus of the earlier campaign was to try to ensure that the work on the UK continental shelf went to UK yards rather than to yards in Spain and Italy that were, allegedly, highly subsidised. As there is now little work—although it fluctuates—in the whole UK sector, the present campaign concentrates on convincing oil and gas companies to explore, to drill and to produce plans to help the fabrication sector. The picture is not all doom and gloom. It was announced this week that 1,000 jobs have been created on the Caspian sea by Tulloch, whose UK headquarters is in my constituency. That will employ many former Barmac workers.<br><br>
There has been debate today about the amount of oil available in the North sea and on the UK continental shelf. Many seasoned observers have argued that between 4 billion and 4.5 billion barrels remain to be developed in UK waters. After further development, another 1.6 billion barrels could be produced from existing fields. Potential UK production is large, but the oil is in small fields under deep water. That is geologically challenging, and it could be very expensive to extract the oil.<br><br>
Small fields and large companies do not always go together. Some people say that the large companies' strategy is to go for big fields, such as those in the gulf of Mexico. However, I have met representatives of the large oil companies—BP, Texaco, Shell, and Conoco—during the past few years, and I am convinced of their commitment to the UK continental shelf.<br><br>
There have been structural problems with the way in which the North sea is operated. UK block leasing terms do not help to accelerate development, because ownership periods can vary between 30 and 40 years. Some earlier licences will expire in 2010. The Minister might wish to encourage companies to develop existing and new fields, and motivate them to explore and drill. The Government's oil and gas task force, and now Pilot, have worked on that problem and developed the LIFT—licence information for trading—policy to enable companies to swap licences.<br><br>
I am, nevertheless, worried about the fallow fields that companies have decided not to develop, after having been granted licences for them. On 21 December 1999, I tabled a written question to my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, who was then the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe. She replied that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"108 significant oil and gas discoveries"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 21 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 460w.]</p></blockquote>
had had a licence for more than 10 years, but not been developed. The LIFT initiative will help to develop the potential of the UK continental shelf.<br><br>
We need to encourage the establishment of small oil companies, which have fewer overheads and more manoeuvrability. In the USA, clusters of such companies, which benefit from lower corporation tax, operate groups of small fields.<br><br>
The UK does not have a national champion or flagship operator comparable to Statoil in Norway or Elf and Total—which have now merged—in France. Despite the fact that those companies operate in a free market, they are highly supportive of Norwegian and French industry and technology. In the United States, every oil company is a United States champion.<br><br>
Investment decisions by oil companies are extremely complicated and depend on many factors, including the price of oil, accessibility, the geology of fields, demand, levels of reserves, exploration costs and supply. The key is confidence. No one can force large companies to invest in the UK sector. The Chancellor has kept his side of the bargain by keeping the fiscal regime unchanged. Implementing the roll-over of capital gains relief was a positive development that helped companies dramatically. It is time for oil companies to use or lose their licences. We must encourage smaller companies to enter the market, and we should develop a UK champion.<br><br>
Let us not forget about the future of gas. Gas-fired power stations play an important role in the market. The Minister may wish to comment on the opening up of the stricter consents policy in respect of such installations. There are positive factors for the future. The Minister's recent announcement of the licensing of the white zone—the deep water between the mainland and the Faroes—was extremely important. The estimates for those prospects are between 10 million and 30 million barrels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks about a champion. Is he suggesting a new Statoil in the form of a Britoil or a Scotoil? That is a friendly question—I am genuinely interested in what he means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid of friendly questions from the hon. Gentleman. In terms of the structure of the market, it is important to have a UK champion and to develop an approach that is closely related to our UK continental shelf. I am not knocking existing companies such as BP and Shell—they have an important role to play—but we should consider examples from other countries in Europe and the rest of the world.<br><br>
As I said, there are positive aspects for the future. We need to consider sub-sea technology, satellite work, standardisation and simplification. Pilot, the son of the oil and gas taskforce, is addressing those issues. It is arguable whether satellite work will provide employment for the fabrication industry. Probably it will not, but decommissioning and recommissioning probably will.<br><br>

David Smith, the president of the UK Offshore Operators Association, recently commented on a new forecast concerning the UK's self-sufficiency in oil and gas, which he believes can be extended. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are compelling reasons to invest here. The benefit of the established infrastructure, the UK's fiscal stability, together with the UK's track record, is that it offers investors swifter development times."</p></blockquote>
The market is volatile, cyclical, global and dominated by multinational organisations and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Not even the Brahan seer—an earlier constituent of mine— could have predicted the current price of oil, but I can see a future for the fabrication industry in Scotland, especially in the highlands, based on diversification, exports and niche marketing, especially in pipeline work.<br><br>
We must not forget investment in renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and wave power, which require exactly the same world-leading engineering skills that have been used to exploit North sea oil and gas. As Greenpeace has said, if the UK gets 10 per cent. of its electricity from offshore wind by 2010, 36,000 jobs could be created. That would more than make up for the losses in the fabrication sector. I believe that there is a future for fabrication and for the oil industry as a whole, which deserves our support and assistance.<br><br>
Tory Governments squandered £130 billion of North sea oil revenues, which could have been used to rebuild Scotland, instead of funding the dole queues. This Government have worked hard to bring the industry together through Pilot, to encourage investment, to deliver training and to support diversification.<br><br>
Perhaps the days of the giant rig buildings are gone. The future belongs to sub-sea tie-backs, extended reach wells and floating production vessels. The future belongs to fields such as Leodow, Golden Eye and Clair—the future is exciting. The oil and gas industry is crucial to this country in terms of jobs and investment. The Government are supporting the industry so that the black gold of the North sea and Atlantic will be an asset to Scotland not only today, but for generations yet unborn.</span></p>
<p>12.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard many comments in this debate that I would have made myself.<br><br>
I thank the Secretary of State for her analysis of progress in the industry, which is not only an upstream but a downstream industry. Like the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, I am involved with the all-party offshore oil and gas industry group, of which I am the secretary. I am also involved with the all-party chemical industry group, which includes downstream petrochemicals that are relevant to Grangemouth in my constituency, where 47 per cent. of North sea oil is refined and processed.<br><br>
Hon. Members have already mentioned that oil and gas have had a big effect on the Scottish economy. When the Labour party formed the Government, I followed the debate about whether the Chancellor
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
should be taxing the oil and gas industry. Along with other hon. Members, I lobbied heavily against that idea because, in the main, of oil selling at $10 a barrel. We were not against the principle of sharing revenues from a buoyant industry, but we wanted to ensure that nothing happened to damage an industry that seemed to be facing a serious slump.<br><br>
I recently attended a BP seminar where the company pointed out that in the period between 1995 and 2000 its income in Scotland increased from £1.1 billion to £1.3 billion. That increase was despite the fact, which has already been mentioned, that when the Forties field began—I was in university at the time—people predicted that it would end by 1995, which would have given it a 30-year life. Steve Marshall of BP is now discussing a further 30 years of life for the field. That is because new technology has been developed in the oilfields. We do not need to put up another heavy platform, because horizontal drilling and 3D imaging allow us to find oil and gas deposits under large salt mushrooms and direct a drill bit to extract them, which would previously have been impossible. There is scope for future development in the North sea.<br><br>
The problem is that growth has not been matched by increased employment. BP admitted that during that period direct and indirect employees probably decreased by about 10,000, which, in terms of North sea employment, is a high figure. There is a positive benefit, because overall we have 1 million more people in employment, which means that many skills have transferred. I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) said that he anticipates that many former Barmac construction workers will go to the Caspian development from Scotland. One idea behind the oil and gas taskforce is that our technology and expertise can be sold abroad. It is not a bad thing that people will be taking those skills with them.<br><br>
I have been struck by the way in which people work in the North sea. I first visited offshore in 1992, although I did not have to go through the experience of diving off a 10 ft platform. As a non-swimmer, I would have panicked if I had had to dive off a platform to find my way into an upturned boat. There has been a remarkable change between my first and most recent visits. When I recently examined one of the Shell fields with the all-party offshore oil and gas industry group, I discovered that a step change had been introduced. In the early 1990s, conflict was the order of the day on the issue of safety in the North sea. However, following the step change we met safety representatives, who used to be regarded by those on the rigs as antagonists, but who are now seen as part of the planning process. Safety is planned in because working safe also means working more efficiently, which means that companies obtain greater productivity and the work force feel engaged.<br><br>
That step change has also come onshore. I have noticed that the partnership arrangements in Grangemouth are changing its atmosphere. When people lost their negotiating rights, they thought that only the law would reinstate them. Partnership has involved the work force and the way in which people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
work in the oil and gas industry, and some would say, cynically, that that is because the companies do not want a ballot on membership. The Prime Minister said at the Inverness conference that trade unions should seek the right to be involved in negotiations in the workplace. However, the step change has come onshore and partnership has developed a way of working that has been reported to me to be beneficial.<br><br>
Those whose Sunday read is not the <i>News of the World</i> may have read <i>The Scotsman</i> on Monday with the headline, "Scotland's corridor of death", and a picture of Grangemouth. It was one of the worst pieces of reporting on a serious subject that I have ever seen in a national newspaper. It is not just jobs and profits that are important; the environment and health and safety are, too. The report in the <i>News of the World,</i> which continued in <i>The Scotsman,</i> gave the impression that people living within 40 miles of a petrochemical complex were in danger of getting cancer or other illnesses because of the chemical processes. For some reason, a link was made with an oil-fired power station in Northern Ireland, so the corridor was continuous. I am not playing down the need for the industry and environmental organisations continually to improve the monitoring of any flaring or effluents downstream or elsewhere. However, I was not contacted about the report—nor was anyone else involved in environmental health or the local health board—which was based on the statement of a retired general practitioner in Milford Haven. He may have had an interest in cancer clusters, but there was more concern than evidence, because no evidence has been produced.<br><br>
The <i>News of the World</i> report stated that heavy sulphur oil from the middle east and Africa was used, but that is not used in the chemical refining process in Grangemouth. The oil comes down the pipeline from the Forties field. Dr. van Steenis said that there was no requirement to measure particles and particulates of 2.5 microns or less, but that they somehow get into people's biosystems from the atmosphere and can cause cancer. If there is evidence of small particles, we should look for them. It is not a question of disparaging his concern or putting down an opposing view. If there is anything to be concerned about, research should investigate how it affects the biosystem. However, we should not do that in an atmosphere of hysteria. The question is whether it is safe to live anywhere in the central belt of Scotland if the 40-mile corridor is threatening people's lives. If people lose confidence in oil and gas from the North sea, those who invest in it and advance the industry will also lose confidence. The article was not helpful to the industry and I hope that we can have serious discussion of and research into the concerns of Dr. van Steenis from Milford Haven, but not in an atmosphere of hysteria.<br><br>
I have just returned from Brussels with the European Scrutiny Committee, which discussed with the environment directorate the sixth environmental programme for the European Union. The five elements that will be examined include the chemical
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
industry and its effect on the environment. I share some of the concerns, which I have raised as chair of the all-party group on the chemical industry. There is evidence that if heavy low-valency polychlorinated biphenyls in the atmosphere are ingested, they may cause endocrine disruption and developmental problems in the foetus. Work on that has been done by Dr. Theo Colborn which the European Union will rightly examine.<br><br>
Positive statements have been made about the industry and its future. Discussion of the way in which we raise revenue from the industry and how we spend it should be balanced and bipartisan. It is important to recognise that the industry is a fundamental part of the Scottish economy and provides great benefits. In my view, North sea oil is an east coast UK industry, not just a Scottish industry. For example, the all-party group on the offshore oil and gas industry was set up, and is chaired, by my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard). Moreover, the two fields most recently connected to the Forties network are south of the Scottish-English border. The previous Government decided to link them to the Forties field, and they are supplying much of the feedstock that will underpin the recent £500 million investment in Grangemouth. Although the industry benefits Scotland it also benefits the UK as a whole.</span></p>
<p>12.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is 30 years ago this year that, as a young research and information officer for the North East Scotland Development Authority, I first came into contact with the North sea oil and gas industry. At that time, the discovery of the Forties field had not been announced, although the first successful well had been tested and reported.<br><br>
As has been pointed out a number of times, people tried to work out how important the industry would be and how long it would last. Because of the emerging oil crisis, there was a mad scramble to extract the oil as quickly as possible. Indeed, between the two general elections in 1974, the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), who was Prime Minister before the February election, visited me in my Aberdeen office to discuss the implications of developments in the North sea. After briefing him, I said, "Mr. Heath, I wonder whether, had you come here 12 months ago, you might still be Prime Minister." I said that because he had totally failed to understand the significance of what was happening.<br><br>
In 1972, I received a telephone call from the private secretary of the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. He said, "This afternoon, the Secretary of State must answer a question in the House on the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the North sea, the number of supply boats and the number of people employed." I asked why he was telling me this, and he replied, "Because the Department does not have that information but we've been told that you might." I was indeed able to provide the information, but I also pointed out that, given that his Department had issued the licences, it was somewhat surprising that it had failed to find out what people were doing with them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
On realising the scale of what was happening in the North sea, many of us tried to get that message across. I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond): it was indeed difficult to persuade people that the industry might last 20 or 30 years, let alone 60 years or more. In fact, we have yet to yield half—or perhaps a third, who can say?—of the oil that new discoveries and enhanced recovery techniques are likely to produce. That is the stage that this mature industry has reached.<br><br>
I was interested by what the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan said about a fund. Such an idea is not new, but he was right to report what Norway has done in different circumstances. In fact, there was much discussion about that idea in the 1970s. As the then Scottish Liberal party spokesman on oil and gas, I was instrumental in proposing the use of an oil development fund separate from general taxation. Indeed, the proposal was included in our manifesto commitments. I remember Sam Brittan saying that such revenue might be put into tradable bonds instead of a fund, giving every member of society a stake from which they could benefit, and which they could use as they saw fit. That would have been a good idea. It could have produced an unexpected windfall for funding projects that otherwise could not be undertaken.<br><br>
The problem is that the revenue has become part of mainstream taxation, so if we forgo it the money has to be found from somewhere else. Forgoing the current projected revenue from the North sea would be the equivalent of about 2p on the standard rate of income tax across the UK. If it were Scotland alone, it would be more like 15p or 20p. It is not necessarily a bad idea, but it must be funded from somewhere else within the revenue stream.<br><br>
The Government have been congratulated on all sides—and deservedly so—for the partnership that was developed through Pilot. If there were a Conservative Member on the Committee, I like to believe that there would still be all-party consensus on that. It was exactly the sort of partnership that was required. Credit should be given where it is due, even though it came out of a negative review in the first part of the Parliament. Lessons have, however, been learned, and we should give credit for that, too.<br><br>
My colleagues and I strenuously advised the Government against that taxation review. There may be a case for reviewing taxation periodically. It is important to remind the industry that, virtually every year for 18 years, the Conservative Government changed the tax without consultation or any consideration of the often damaging implications.<br><br>
Two factors have produced an undesirably low level of exploration. The first was the responsibility of the previous Conservative Government. Tax concessions on exploration had been abused, not by all operators, but especially by one large oil company. The case for review was not the main point at issue. An abrupt withdrawal—without any warning or consultation— of the allowance that had been built into the industry's programmes led to an immediate and sharp collapse of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
forward exploration. We have never returned to the level of exploration that pre-dated those circumstances.<br><br>
That withdrawal, combined with the second factor, the collapse of the price of oil, resulted in a level of exploration in 1999 that was the lowest in the 30 years of my involvement—and it only marginally picked up in 2000. We hope that confidence in a reasonably stable oil price—UKOOA is less confident than others—will improve the position. The Government should assess whether more should be done to stimulate and encourage further exploration. They should at least clarify what level of exploration the industry should try to achieve and establish whether it requires an incentive or just a programming agreement. The industry's future is, after all, based on exploration.<br><br>
The other crucial issue is skills. The problem is becoming acute for an industry that is mature in more senses than one. The industry has been around for more than a generation, and many people working in it are at the end of the generation that entered during the initial rapid expansion, and are now close to retirement. It is not clear that replacement skills are entering the system as quickly as required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The national training organisation set up to assist the oil and gas industry is focusing on that issue. He may also be interested to hear about a new internet portal, which acts as an on-line recruitment vehicle. Available jobs are posted on-line and people can apply for them. The appropriate skill levels are specified to encourage new entrants into the industry for the long term.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, but for that to be successful, the skills must have been developed. The image of the industry, which is not always as attractive as it should be, is a problem. People in contact with it recognise what an exciting and stimulating industry— very much at the frontiers of new technology—it is. Young people should be encouraged to view it as a clean, exciting and attractive industry with a secure future, even though, like all industries, it has its ups and downs.<br><br>
Many of my self-employed constituents working in the oil and gas industry have made representations against the Government's IR35 changes. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that when those changes bite they may have a negative effect and, if people leave jobs, they will not bring in the revenue that the Government hope. My constituents have pointed out that the changes would make it even more difficult to train replacements who might take over their business. I urge the Government to consider whether such warnings are accurate, and if they are, to implement initiatives to draw people into the industry.<br><br>
The Government have a new deal initiative for the long-term unemployed, which I hoped that they would pilot in Aberdeen, but Glasgow and Edinburgh were selected. One or two people in my constituency have been blacklisted by the industry and, despite their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
skills and qualifications, have never been able to work. At a time when there are skills shortages, it is disgraceful that a way has not been found of reestablishing such people in work. There are skilled engineers who, because of age or circumstances, have been unemployed for two years, even though they have made hundreds of applications and attended many interviews. It is utterly ridiculous that existing skills are not fully used. I hope that in future it will be possible to match skills and jobs.<br><br>
I have one more point to raise with the Minister about a matter that worries us. For the moment, the problem has resolved itself because it was the interconnector differential between gas prices and oil prices that caused a depression. Although the situation is now more encouraging, an awful lot of combined heat and power investment was knocked on the head in that period.<br><br>
In my constituency in the north-east, paper mills have made good investments in combined heat and power systems—I speak as a vice president of the Combined Heat and Power Association—as it is important that gas is used in the most efficient, productive and environmentally friendly way. I hope that the Government will ensure a continuous investment in efficient ways of using gas that will avoid sharp downturns and the loss of the momentum for combined heat and power, which happened for two years.<br><br>
This has been a good and important debate. The Government's partnership with the industry is constructive, and as long as they remain open to and act on constructive suggestions from all quarters, inside and outside the industry, and from those of us in Scotland who have connections with the industry, it has a great future and will contribute substantially to the economy of Scotland and the United Kingdom for a long time to come.</span></p>
<p>12.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I speak for all members of the Committee in thanking you, Mr. Maxton, for your usual skilled chairmanship, which we should miss if, for any reason, which I shall certainly not mention, you were no longer to do this job.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Gordon rightly said, this has been a good debate, and also a good-natured debate—[HON. MEMBERS: It is not over yet.] It is not going to change now, in spite of the temptation.<br><br>
I shall deal with as many points raised during the debate as possible rather than making a prepared speech. I particularly appreciated the positive contributions from the two Liberal Democrat Members and, I must confess, the unusually positive speech from the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan. It is the new, statesmanlike approach that we all find rather strange; no doubt he is getting back to Westminster practices in preparation for continuing here.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran (<span class='memberconstituency'>Aberdeen, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is right that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan made a positive contribution, but some of the things that he said were not accurate. I do not want to alter the tone of the debate, but he waxed eloquent about all the things that the fund could have done had we contributed to it, without mentioning that most of the debate on the fund, as the hon. Member for Gordon pointed out, took place in the 1970s. That debate came to an end on 28 March 1979 when the SNP voted with the Tories and destroyed all these things. It is exactly 22 years ago today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I could not have put it better myself. Although I said it yesterday in Westminster Hall, it bears repetition.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan was right to congratulate the Government. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was the first chairman of Pilot and was instrumental in this. It is an important development in our commitment to improve the competitiveness of the UK oil and gas industry. Above all, it will encourage and provoke continued exploration and development.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon asked about targets. My right hon. Friend covered that in her introduction. Specifically in relation to 2010, investment will be sustained at £3 billion per annum, with a 50 per cent. increase in exports in oil and gas supplies by 2005. There are key targets: it is not just a general expression. I must tell the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan that on this occasion the Norwegians are following our example. I am sure that he will welcome that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that there are major skills shortages? Can the Pilot targets be met?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to come to that in a moment. First, I shall deal with another point made by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan about progress in Pilot.<br><br>
An announcement on 18 January invited applications for two blocks in the eastern Irish sea containing gas discoveries, which have been championed by the work group. One of the clusters, which lies in unlicensed acreage in the eastern Irish sea, has recently been offered for licence. We look forward to seeing development plans for some or parts of the clusters before the end of the year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine raised the spectre of a windfall tax. He said that it would discourage development. I agree with him. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear, decisions on oil taxation must be made on a long-term basis, not in response to short-term economic factors. We have all agreed that. Fiscal stability is an essential part of our attractiveness in the UK as an oil province.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South also spoke about taxation. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry visited Aberdeen on 9 March, he announced that the Government have agreed a royalty remission with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
Talisman that will help the Beatrice redevelopment project to proceed. That is another way in which we are encouraging developments. Talisman said that it could not have progressed with its development without it. That is a specific example of the way forward. Royalty remission is negotiated case by case by the DTI, and it is open to further discussion with any operator who has a strong case. I hope that my hon. Friends and others will encourage operators to come forward.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South also made an important point, reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber, about fallow fields. The Government showed our determination to see new work carried out on the UK continental shelf when we launched the fallow blocks initiative last year when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe. She accepted a Pilot recommendation that we should repeat the process every year from now on. During the fallow initiative the DTI invited the operators of every fallow block and every fallow discovery to review their plans and either to work the acreage or relinquish it so that someone else can have a chance to explore. Again, that will be widely welcomed.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber also referred to fabrication. I believe that no one has done more than he has to protect his constituents' interests. Periods of change are painful for employees caught up in their midst, and the impact on employment around Inverness has been especially great, but we are seeing signs that there is hope for the future. Barmac's dry dock at Nigg is being used by smaller companies for work on drilling rigs. Barmac and other major yards are determined to be able to bid for contracts relating to the development of BP's Clair project, west of Shetland.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend said, there has been further good news this week: a licence has been awarded to Tulloch, a company based in Inverness, to provide labour for projects to develop Kazakhstan's major oil reserves. I visited Kazakhstan before I joined my current Department and put my passport in a cupboard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now you visit Inverness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.<br><br>
The project in Kazakhstan—which has huge oilfields, as I saw—will result in 500 skilled workers, including welders and pipe fitters, going there later this spring and up to a further 500 being required at a later date.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine rightly said that people are an important resource of the oil industry, as they are of other industries. Training continues to be vital to develop skills in that high-knowledge industry.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), referred to renewables. I shall visit Islay on Friday to see a wave generator, because we want to encourage the development of renewables. A few weeks ago, I visited the Western Isles council—it is the only way for me to get overseas nowadays—which has major plans for a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
comprehensive and coherent renewables strategy. The Government attach great importance to renewables: we have allocated £250 million over the next three years to support them throughout the UK.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) raised a somewhat different point. I agree with his comments on media reports. The Scottish Executive's Health Department continuously monitors the distribution of many diseases across the various Scottish health board areas. The figures from Dr. van Steenis provide no evidence of a credible link between exposure to emissions from the installations mentioned and increased incidence of cancers, heart attacks or strokes. We are not aware of the basis on which Dr. van Steenis makes the various claims. Indeed, reviews have shown that air quality in Scotland generally is, as we would expect, very good.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine referred to safety, and I agree with him. BP with Jigsaw and all other operators are now committed to working with their work forces and the Health and Safety Executive on all offshore projects. Change has taken place, as several hon. Members have said.<br><br>
I did not agree with everything that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan said. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South rightly said, when the hon. Gentleman talks about using oil revenues in the way suggested by the SNP, he is living in cloud cuckoo land. The Scottish people should beware of the SNP's back-of-the-envelope—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It says here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It says it because I wrote it.<br><br>
The Scottish people should beware of the SNP's back-of-the-envelope calculations claiming a surplus for an independent Scotland, particularly when they are predicated on assumptions about revenue from oil, which is finite, however long it lasts, and a primary commodity with an extremely volatile world market price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, as I have already given way on a number of occasions.<br><br>
That volatility ranges from £10 billion down to £1 billion, at which point we would be at the mercy of OPEC. The message is clear: the oil and gas industry is changing in shape and direction, but it is not disappearing. We have all the necessary experience in Scotland to contribute our great skills and expertise not only to the rest of the UK but overseas. Now is the time to show that we are flexible enough to meet future challenges. With the support and co-operation of all those involved, the Government are confident that the oil and gas industry will continue to be a vital part of Scottish life for a long time to come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, may I briefly breach the usual conventions? I thank all hon. Members for the way in which they have co-operated in today's debate and all the other Scottish Grand Committee debates that I have chaired over the years. It has not always been as friendly as this, but I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
rarely had trouble from any hon. Members—except once. I also thank the other hon. Members who have acted as Chairman during this Parliament, in particular the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, who, like me, is retiring from the House. I thank her for the work that she has done, and I thank all hon. Members again.</span></p>

<p><i>Motion made and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—<i>[Mrs. McGuire.}</i></p>
<p>1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that <i>Hansard</i> staff will have become more familiar with the Scottish accent over the past few weeks, with so many of us securing Adjournment debates. We should not be surprised by that, because the impact on our communities of a Government who are committed to social justice has been substantial. So many hon. Members represent communities that were abandoned to poverty and decline over 18 years of Conservative rule, and it is with great pride that we want to celebrate what has happened since 1997, almost four years ago today.<br><br>
I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Maxton, if I reminisce about something that you will remember clearly. We must not forget that, 22 years ago today, Scottish National party Members voted to remove a Labour Government and usher in the Thatcher era. I remember that so clearly, not just because it was the birth of nationalism, but because my constituency decided to return to Labour from the SNP. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) lost her seat to Norman Hogg, now Lord Hogg. He was not the only one to be elected in that historic year: also elected in 1979 were my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall), for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) and for Ochil (Mr. O'Neill)—who also said goodbye to the SNP—as well as the Minister. They were joined by the present Speaker and you, Mr. Maxton. Just as we said goodbye to the nationalists then, we will be saying goodbye to them whenever my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister decides to call the general election.<br><br>
I requested a debate on the Budget because, although it is only a few weeks since the Chancellor delivered his fourth Budget, I am aware of how quickly that can be forgotten. It bears repeating. Every household in Scotland has gained something from the Budget, which has been warmly welcomed by all groups and organisations throughout the country. It was a Budget for families, pensioners, and low-paid and disadvantaged communities across Scotland.<br><br>
Scotland is reaping the benefits of the Government's sound management of the economy. Every extra penny spent in Scotland is a direct result of our policy of stability and prudence. Have we not been proven
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
correct during the past four years? Those groups that wanted instant cash in 1997 are now reaping even greater rewards. By October, every household in the United Kingdom will be better off by an average of £590 a year, and they will receive £240 of that this year. By October 2001, United Kingdom families with children will be better off by an average of £1,000 a year, receiving £420 of that this year.<br><br>
Personal taxation and benefit changes mean that over the Parliament a single-earner family will be £520 a year better off, but a single-earner family on average earnings with two young children will be £3,000 a year better off in real terms. We cannot say that too often. Those hard facts are making significant changes in people's lives and it is important to repeat that. The impact on families is substantial and we want to ensure that people get the message and understand it.<br><br>
What does the Budget mean for Scotland? It delivered £200 million of extra spending on public services in Scotland over the next three years. Whatever anyone says, that is hard cash. It also delivered huge increases for families, with maternity benefit increased from £60 to £100 a week. Those of us with an interest in women balancing work and family life welcome the huge changes to paternity benefit and to paternity and maternity leave. That impacts greatly on families and we want to support families. People need help when their children are very small and they want help to get back into work when their children are ready to go to school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Anniesland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the introduction of paternity benefit will help to address some of the problems of family life, because the male will now be identified as having a role to play in the family?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for making that important point. Paternity benefit will not just fund men to be at home when their children are born; it will enable them to create a bond with the child, which is so important as the relationship develops over the years. In Scotland, we must try to change the culture of the father not being wholly part of the family.<br><br>
We are also tackling pensioner poverty through a variety of measures. Scottish pensioners will welcome a higher than inflation increase in the basic state pension next month, of £5 to £72.50 a week for a single person, and of £8 to £115.90 for couples. In Scotland 900,000 pensioners will benefit with further increases of £3 and £4.50 next year. From April, an additional 15,000 Scottish pensioners will benefit from the targeted increase in the guaranteed minimum income for the poorest pensioners. Half of all Scottish pensioner households will benefit from the pensioners credit which rewards pensioners with modest savings. That will be introduced in 2003.<br><br>
There is also good news for the low-paid. An extension of the 10p income tax band to £1,880 will benefit those with taxable incomes below that amount, and 2.1 million Scottish taxpayers will see a difference
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
in their pay packets. This week's announcement of a 40 per cent. increase in the national minimum wage to £4.10 an hour will benefit 120,000 Scots.<br><br>
The Budget also provides support for small businesses, and every hon. Member in the Room will welcome the freeze, for the fourth year running, in the duty on spirits. It will be welcomed by the 111,000 people who work in the industry and by consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the national minimum wage, my hon. Friend and I have had many discussions about low pay, especially in my constituency and that of the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan). We represent an area that has been badly hit for many years. The steady increase in the national minimum wage does not stand alone, and is coupled with the introduction of other policies, including enhancement of low taxation, which has been further improved in the Budget. This is not a question of one policy in isolation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, and we must remember that those policies are having an effect week on week, year on year, and people are benefiting tremendously.<br><br>
I was delighted that the First Minister welcomed the Budget as a tremendous boost to the Scottish Parliament and a great demonstration of how Westminster and Holyrood work together to ensure that the interests of the people of Scotland are looked after Every Budget since the election of the Scottish Parliament has delivered additional resources for the public sector in Scotland. This year, for the first time, local authorities were given a three-year settlement. I know from my background in local government that it has been asking for that for many years. A three-year settlement will allow local authorities to plan vital public services such as education, social services, policing and crime prevention, and to deal with issues that worry our constituents.<br><br>
The impact in my constituency has been substantial. The new deal for young long-term unemployed people has been a great success—440 young people have found real jobs through the programme and 230 have gone into further education or an environmental task. That is a positive outcome, and attitudes to work and getting people into work have changed, which has also been a great success. Local jobcentres should be congratulated because they have embraced the culture of working with clients, which is a tremendous improvement.<br><br>
Next Monday I shall present a certificate to the 200th person since July to obtain a job through a small resource centre set up by the staff in Cumbernauld drugs centre. That initiative came not from the Government, but from the staff. Since July last year, 200 people have gone into full-time employment, which is a tremendous achievement. I congratulate Scott Taylor, manager of the jobcentre, and his staff, and particularly Nicky Carrick, who set up and runs the resource centre. The 200 people who have obtained jobs and their families know the impact of that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
Another aspect that has made a tremendous difference is the way in which we have treated pensioners. One thousand of the least well-off in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth will receive the minimum income guarantee, and 7,337 already benefit from the winter fuel allowance and will continue to benefit. Those same people will benefit from the boost in the basic state pension. We have also reduced the tax burden, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) said.<br><br>
Those may seem to be cold statistics, but when a young single parent with a young son at school tells me that she is more than £100 a week better off because of the working families tax credit and the change in child credit, that means something. It makes such a difference to those families, who can see a future, and see that they are valued by society. That changes their attitudes, which is something not to undervalue.<br><br>
The message for Scotland is about investing in the long-term prosperity and stability created by a Labour Government, and not the boom and bust created by a Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Marshall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Shettleston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the message for the people of Scotland is that we must not return to 1979 when the SNP—the tartan Tories—voted to bring down the Labour Government and allowed Mrs. Thatcher to come to power? I am one of the Members whom my hon. Friend referred to, who entered Parliament then, and suffered from 18 years of Tory destruction, especially of jobs, in Scotland. My constituency had the highest unemployment in Scotland during that period—20 per cent.—and was among the 10 areas with the highest unemployment in the UK. The main benefit emanating from the Chancellor's Budgets is the reduction in unemployment. Unemployment in my constituency is now 7 per cent., which, although far too high, is still a tremendous improvement. Does my hon. Friend agree that the message must be that Mr. Hague's little helper is a menace to the people of Scotland, and the Conservatives must never be allowed to return to power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a good speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It bears repeating that if the Tories returned to power, we would lose every advantage that we have gained, and all those people who have returned to work and got themselves on to the first rung of the ladder would be disadvantaged. Communities such as Shettleston, which my hon. Friend represents, would be the first to be disadvantaged, as they were in 1979. We must not allow that to happen. We need stability, and we need to continue the impact of the Chancellor's policies. We do not want the Conservatives' boom and bust, but we do not want the folly of SNP tax hikes, either. The SNP may be suggesting only one tax hike now, but there will be more to come.<br><br>
The Budget is another step along the way to building a society in which there is opportunity for all: a strong, inclusive and caring modern society.</span></p>

<p>1.17 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. George Foulkes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) on securing a debate on such an important subject. I say that in the knowledge that this is the fourth Adjournment debate to which I have replied in eight days. I said to some of my hon. Friends that I was in danger of running out of things to say, but they did not believe me—I do not know why. As has been rightly said, most of the things that the Government have done in the past four years are well worth repeating again and again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Go on. Say them again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's endorsement. I always said that he was one of the more reasonable members of the Scottish National party.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity to highlight the benefits of the Budget that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced, particularly those for Scotland, I also welcome the opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to delivering an economic strategy that is good for the United Kingdom and for Scotland. Our main priorities are delivering economic stability and prudent management of the economy. That will enable us to deliver the investment necessary to improve our public services. My hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston, who entered Parliament with me in 1979, is one person who is determined to see public services improve in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland. He will have welcomed the Budget.<br><br>
We will have more investment, not less, in key public services such as schools and hospitals. Those services would be jeopardised by Tory tax cuts of £16 billion, if the Tories ever regained the levers of power. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is right to warn of the dangers of voting SNP, which would make that more likely. She is also right to remind us of the fact that 22 years ago to this day, the SNP voted with the Tories and gave us 18 years of Tory Government that ravaged the United Kingdom, and Scotland in particular, giving us 3 million unemployed, the poll tax and all the rest of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the electioneering in which the Minister is indulging and return him to the topic of the debate. One of the disappointments in the Budget was the continuing bias of the tax system against the whisky industry, which is an important sector of the Scottish economy. The industry is grateful that tax on whisky did not go up, but it still suffers from the fact that other alcoholic drinks are taxed less on alcoholic content. Has the Minister discussed with the Chancellor whether that can be rectified in the immediate future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not giving away a state secret when I say that I, and many other hon. Members representing constituencies with whisky interests, had such discussions with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor before the Budget. That is why we were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
absolutely delighted when, for the fourth year running, he froze the duty on whisky—as well as on other spirits. Scotland is now one of the biggest producers of gin, vodka and white rum. The hon. Gentleman referred to the comparison between whisky and other alcoholic drinks. Scotland is one of the biggest producers of beer—127,000 people are employed in the brewing and licensed trade, and I do not know why the hon. Gentleman should want to disadvantage them. They need help as well, which is why beer duty was also frozen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My colleagues on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs and I have been considering an investigation into the Scottish drinks industry. It is ironic that beer duty, as well as whisky duty, was frozen in the Budget, given that some of the main brewers in the UK then increased the price of beer by 10p a pint. When the Treasury is relatively lenient in its treatment of those companies, some of them then take advantage of their customers. Does not that send out the wrong signals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is wrong when brewers do that with beer, and it is wrong when oil companies do it with petrol. The Government are deliberately trying to bring prices down, and we should encourage producers, whether of beer or petrol, not to take advantage of that by raising their prices.<br><br>
Budget 2001 is part of our continuing commitment to target support where it is most needed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth said, much more eloquently and powerfully than I could. It is for families, children, pensioners, the socially disadvantaged, communities, public services, enterprise and innovation. That is the new Scotland; that is the new Britain heralded by the Labour Government and by the Budget.<br><br>
Our targeted tax cuts promote work and enterprise and will enable us to reach our goal. Every Labour Member here will be especially proud that this is the first Labour Government that I recall to have committed themselves to achieving the target of full employment. That is exactly what we should be doing. My hon. Friend paid tribute to the work of the Employment Service. Having visited people there recently, I think that they are the Cinderellas of the civil service. The special advisers, in particular, do extremely good work in helping lone parents and the disabled into work. We have a particular responsibility to those people in terms of finding them employment.<br><br>
You, Mr. Maxton, like my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston, entered Parliament at the same time as me. We inherited an economy in an abysmal state: high inflation, high interest rates, high employment levels and public services that had been depleted by successive Tory Government cuts. We have had to work hard to change that and to achieve the necessary economic stability to improve our public services. We have the lowest inflation for 30 years. Mortgage repayments, which affect the majority of our constituents, have been substantially reduced, for which they are rightly thanking us. We have the lowest

long-term interest rate for 35 years and unemployment is at its lowest since 1975. Before we entered the Chamber, I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston that that was under—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Employment in Scotland is at its highest level since 1960, which is so long ago that I had just left school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne McGuire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Big school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite so.<br><br>
Hon. Members will remember the gasp of astonishment at the Budget statement when the Chancellor announced the debt repayments that we have made in the current year. That is not only something to do for Prudence—whoever she may be. The important point is that that cuts debt interest payments, which frees up money for public services.<br><br>
As a result of this year's Budget, the Scottish Executive will have an increase of £200 million in its budget over the next three years. That is on top of the increases announced by my right hon. Friend in last year's spending review. That will enable the Executive to invest in its key spending priorities to improve public services for the people of Scotland.<br><br>
We have also dealt with duty on alcohol. Furthermore, I remind hon. Members that betting tax has also been abolished. Small bookmakers from Mauchline, Catrine, Muirkirk and other parts of my constituency said to me, "Can you press the Chancellor to abolish betting tax?" I am not taking all the credit, but it is good that small betting shops have obtained an advantage. We shall, of course, consider what else we can do for them, but that was a significant step forward. It also dealt with the problem of offshore betting, which was causing difficulties.<br><br>
We have also listened to motorists and hauliers, who were faced with tough competition from the continent. A new vehicle excise duty for cars will mean savings of between £5 and £70 for 180,000 Scots. More than 30,000 HGV operators in Scotland will benefit from a range of targeted measures to improve competitiveness, fuel economy and emissions.

Additionally, we have made a 2p cut in duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol, which will benefit almost 2.5 million Scottish motorists. I must declare an interest— that figure includes me. I went to the petrol station in Ayr, where I hope that I set an example by buying ultra-low sulphur petrol, which also saved me a great deal of money. We have also made a 3p cut in duty on ultra-low sulphur diesel, which will benefit a further 500,000 motorists in Scotland. Those are substantial improvements.<br><br>
We have helped people who are suffering in poverty. We had a debate last Thursday, which was initiated by the Chairman of the Scottish Affairs Committee, on the excellent report that that Committee has produced in relation to poverty. We have set demanding targets for tackling poverty among children, and we are the first Government to have set such targets. Our aim is to halve child poverty in 10 years and to abolish it within 20 years, which is something else of which my hon. Friends can rightly be proud.<br><br>
My hon. Friends can also be proud of the national minimum wage, which is the greatest help that any Government have ever extended to the low-paid and to women. We have introduced the working families tax credit, the new deal for lone parents and the new deal 50-plus scheme. I am running out of time; there is never enough time to say how much—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us have another Adjournment debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good idea.<br><br>
This is a Budget for people; this is a Budget for business. It is a further step by the Government towards dealing with the problems that we inherited, such as the fact that disadvantaged people were excluded from society, and the high levels of unemployment. We have built a fairer society. We are tackling unemployment and social injustice through prudent management of the economy and the maintenance of stability. We are building a society in which everyone can share in rising prosperity. Those who face retirement in the near future can look forward to a peaceful, long and happy retirement, as long as a Labour Government is returned not only for a second term, but for a third and a fourth.</span></p>
