	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir MURDOCH MCKENZIE WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 31, at the end, to add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that any house included in a general statement furnished to the Department in pursuance of section twenty-two, sub-section (2), of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930, shall be deemed to have been included in proposals submitted to the Department within the meaning of this section."</p></blockquote>
The point raised in this Amendment is similar to that which has been already dealt with in previous Amendments. It is the question as to the point at which the line is to be drawn between the old and the new terms to be given for the building of houses. The Act of 1930 lays a statutory duty upon local authorities to send in a general statement as to their housing requirements, and as to what they propose to do to meet those requirements over three years. The first period of three years would not have come to an end till October of this year. What was the object of Parliament in laying this statutory duty upon local authorities? It was obviously, I suggest, to give them an opportunity of making a full survey of what they needed, and also an opportunity of spreading out the work over the whole of the three years, so that the work might be done as economically as possible and in the way they would suit the particular local authorities best. The local authorities which put forward this general statement, obviously must be the best judge as to the way in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
they did this. This Bill proposes summarily to abbreviate that period, and it will almost certainly take away from the local authorities the power of carrying out certain proposals which they had meant to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Secretary of State for Scotland has put down an Amendment to Clause 2 which, I imagine is intended to meet a similar point. I am glad to see that Amendment, but it seems to me that the Amendment which he thinks is required to Clause 2 is equally required to Clause 1. It seems to be meant to meet a grievance of the larger authorities rather than of the smaller authorities. It is quite likely that in a general statement, such as the Act of 1930 had in mind, details would not be put forward by the smaller authorities. After all, they did not have the facilities at the beginning for drawing up their schemes in detail. They had not the highly paid and qualified architects and engineers who can draw up general statements in sufficient detail in the beginning as to meet the requirements of this Amendment. I hope that the Secretary of State will realise that the small authorities are in a very different position from the larger authorities in this way. What is the argument which the Under-Secretary put forward as a defence against the breaking of a pledge, as I suggest that this is? He said that any Parliament is able to undo anything which has been done by any previous Parliament, or, indeed, anything that has been done on previous occasion by the same Parliament. No one disputes the power of Parliament to do that. The question is the expediency and equity of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any Government is going to argue that any pledge put in an Act of Parliament is not binding upon the Government of the day, there is no use at all in putting pledges into Acts of Parliament, and local authorities will not pay the slightest attention to any pledge that may be given by a Government, whether it is enshrined in an Act of Parliament or not. I suggest that this is a case where something should be done by the Government to meet an undoubted grievance. I can understand that some of the general statements may be couched in such vague terms that it may be difficult to accept this Amendment in the fullness with which it is put on the

	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
Paper, but I hope that I have convinced the Secretary of State that there is a point to be met, and I hope that a real attempt will be made to meet it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. Skelton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main proposition of my hon. Friend was that the three years' programme, which under the 1930 Act the local authorities were compelled by Statute to submit to the Department of Health, involved a pledge. A pledge by whom, and to whom? I think that the Committee will see, as soon as we try to answer that question, that there has been no question of a pledge, and the relations between local authorities and the Department of Health in this matter during the currency of the three years have made it clear that neither side regarded the thing in the nature of a pledge at all. The original form of the return in the 1924 Act was two years, and the local authorities were originally required to send biennial returns. If that was a pledge, it was broken in the 1930 Act, when the two years was changed into three years. However, that is a comparatively small point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the facts. If there had been a pledge, was it a one-sided or a two-sided pledge? Were the local authorities to be compelled to complete their programmes within three years? Is that my hon. Friend's view, or is it that they were not to be held by the pledge, but that the State was to be held by its pledge? Surely if there were a pledge at all, it must have bound both parties. I think that my hon. Friend will agree with that. If he does, he will also have to agree that the Department of Health would have been the first to insist—in some cases, no doubt, against the interests of the local authorities, and against their own judgment—on the completion of this programme by the end of 1933. Nothing of that sort has happened. It was merely a general statement of the amount of work which they anticipated they would be able to get through by the end of 1933, and the Section does not make it obligatory upon the local authorities to fulfil the work, or upon the Department of Health to insist upon that work. Therefore, there is no question of a pledge. Had there been a pledge or a duty upon the local autho-
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
rities to make, and a duty upon the Department of Health to insist upon, a complete fulfilment by the end of 1933, the situation would have been statutory, and, in fact, quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. MCKENZIE WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely they had a right to expect that they would get the three years' promise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is not a pledge. A pledge is not receiving everything and giving nothing. If there was any pledge, it must have implied a duty on the part of the local authorities to build by the statutory date. What has happened is something totally different. Taking Scotland as a whole, the three years' programme provided for the local authorities to build 56,000 odd houses. In the first two years of the three-year period they completed just short of 20,000, leaving 36,000 to be built in the remaining year. In the first year they completed 8,300, and in the second year 11,600, and, with that amount of work done in the first two years of this triennial period, my hon. Friend thinks it possible that they could build 36,000 houses in the third year. It is perfectly clear from the manner in which the local authorities have acted that they did not regard themselves as under a duty to fulfil that programme, or they could never have left themselves in the position of having so large a proportion of the work to be done in the last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth of the matter is that the statutory return of 1930, the triennial return which was substituted for the previous biennial return, was not in the nature of a pledge given either by the local authorities to build, or by the State to insist upon the completion of these houses, or to give any particular amount of subsidy for the houses. In the circumstances, I must ask the Committee not to accept this Amendment, because the basis of it is quite untenable, and the attempt to make local authorities fulfil what is regarded as a pledge to build 36,000 houses before December next is something which is incapable of fulfilment, and I venture to say that it would be unreasonable for the Committee to insist upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Under-Secretary has answered the case which has been put forward. It is true that the undertaking is not actually in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
the Statute. Had it been so, our position about moving Amendments would have been entirely different. Nobody here is arguing that this in the Statute, but what we do argue is that obligations can be entered into which are as binding and as sacred as the conditions of a statutory contract. The Under-Secretary says the pledge was broken when the period was extended from two to three years. I have never thought that a person who gave better terms broke a pledge, and in this case the Government gave better terms to the local authorities. The local authorities were urged to make plans for three years for the building of houses. Very wisely, I think, they decided not to get on with everything in the first month or six months, because if they had done so they might have incurred the risk of finding land and materials held up at ransom prices. They said, "We have got three years, and we will plan out our work to cover that period." They proceeded to buy land and to plan ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that the local authorities could not have completed the 56,000 houses in three years, and I do not think they could, but I do not think they would have come very far short of it. In the first year they completed between 8,000 and 9,000 houses, and in the second year close upon 12,000. It must be remembered, however, in the case of building that in the first year one has to start with a clean sheet; nothing has been done, often the land has not been bought. In the third year, however, you are reaping the advantage of all the preliminary work which has been done. A housing scheme which produced 8,000 houses in the first year and nearly 12,000 houses in the second year might possibly reach an output of close upon 20,000 in the third year. Of course, there is a difference between that figure and 36,000, but it would mean 20,000 houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will grant that there was no definite, written pledge, but men and women enter into undertakings in a spirit which is not that of a Shylock. I hope the Under-Secretary does not look upon the relations between the local authorities and the Government in the same way as a moneylender looks at his victim, that everything has to be written down, stamped, crossed and marked. Every day undertakings are entered into between
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
decent men and women in which they do not give a definite, written bond, because they have confidence that each will carry them out in the spirit in which they are made. The City of Glasgow, which is the big city of Scotland, and contains one-fourth of the whole population of the country, feels that in regard to this three-year plan it has not been treated as it ought to have been treated. They have land, and they have entered into definite commitments in connection with this housing scheme. The last time this point was raised the Under-Secretary replied that they had so many acres of land in Glasgow and that those acres could be used for slum clearance work. Unfortunately, most of the land is not suitable for slum clearance, because a good proportion of it lies in contact with other schemes, and, for good or ill, the corporation, having started a scheme, naturally want to complete it on similar lines to those on which it was started. In many cases, too, the land is in every way ready for the building of houses, because streets have been made and sewers laid. To that extent, the preliminary work is done, and yet, although the corporation was that far ahead, the Government are now to withdraw the subsidy which the corporation had been expecting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come down to the hard-and-fast facts of the situation, I do not think the arguments of the Under-Secretary meet the position. When we are trying to draw up a balance sheet of what has been done by all the local authorities in Scotland, we ought to stress the point that certain authorities never tried to fulfil the three-year plan, as the Under-Secretary very well knows. Others made a moderate effort to fulfil the plan, and others, again, really did everything that was possible for a local body to do. In the figures which he has given us, the Under-Secretary has grouped together all the authorities, those which have tried and those which have not tried, and I venture to say that while Glasgow could not have fulfilled the whole programme it came nearer to fulfilling the whole programme than any part of Scotland. Why should a local authority which came very near to fulfilling the bargain be penalised? It ought not to be penalised because it took the Government's circular at its face value. How would any Member of this Committee have read that circular? We should have said that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
were dealing with men who were reasonable and honest and who would give us a fair deal, and we should have acted accordingly. In view of the situation, I submit that this is a very modest, indeed, even a meagre, Amendment, and I think the Under-Secretary ought to have accepted it. I think this is the least which the Scottish Standing Committee had a right to expect from the Government. I was hoping we should get more. From my conversations with City of Glasgow representatives, I think they have been expecting more. Therefore, I hope that the Under-Secretary has not closed the door upon this Amendment, and that he will reconsider his decision and put the local authorities in the position to which they are entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEIL MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be advisable, I think, if the Under-Secretary, instead of giving us only the total figures, were to give us the figures showing the number of houses expected to be built and the numbers that have been built in the different municipalities or counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly give the Committee the detailed figures which are available, and I will begin with the city of Glasgow, because that will cover also the point raised by another hon. Member. The Glasgow programme was for 19,500 houses. In the first year, 1931, they completed 2,600. In the second year they completed 2,400 and they have to complete, in the third year, 14,400. With regard to the point that land has been bought, I propose to deal with that specifically on the next Amendment. All I would say briefly now is that there is really no substance in that point as far as the information collected by the Convention of Royal Burghs and presented by Glasgow is concerned. Let me put it in this broad way. There are absolutely no signs that the local authorities, as a whole, had made preparations by way of buying land for building 36,000 houses, or that Glasgow had made preparation by way of buying land for building 14,000 odd houses before December, 1933.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to slum clearance houses, there the situation as to subsidy is unaltered, but I fear there is absolutely no chance, even in the department of building, in which subsidy remains unaltered, of either the local authorities as a whole or Glasgow alone as a typical authority,
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
being able to complete the programme. The statutory return provided for the following classes—houses to replace unfit houses, houses to deal with overcrowding and houses to meet normal needs. The total programme of houses to replace unfit houses that is to say slum clearance, for Scotland as a whole, was 29,000 houses to be completed in three years. In two years only 7,400 have been completed, leaving 21,000 replacement houses for slum clearance to be completed under the programme by December, 1933—far more than the local authorities could do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCGOVERN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the number in process of being built just now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to get that figure for the hon. Member. If I may be allowed to continue on the point with which I was dealing, I would point out that it is perfectly clear that these 21,000 slum clearance houses could not be built by December, 1933, and it is also true that the preparations for doing so are not to any great extent in existence. Then take the case of Glasgow in relation to slum clearance. The Glasgow programme of slum clearance houses for three years was 7,500. In the first year the number completed was 1,010, and in the second year 564, leaving 5,986 replacement houses to be completed in the third year. It is inconceivable, I am sorry to say, that that could be done. The Committee may take it from me, on the figures which I have given, that even in the department of housing under the 1930 programme in which the subsidy remains unaltered, namely, the slum clearance side of it, it is humanly impossible that that which is by far the most vital part of the programme can be completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth of the matter is that had the local authorities had a definite duty to complete it and had the Department of Health had the definite duty of insisting upon completion, both the local authorities and the Department would gravely have erred in that duty, because in the third month of the last year the situation is that the programme could not be completed. In these circumstances, I beg hon. Members not to press the Amendment. As regards the question of the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern), I am informed that there are under construction in the whole of Scotland 8,000 slum clearance houses, but these, of course, will not all be completed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
at the end of this year. That is out of 21,500 slum clearance houses which, under the programme, should be completed in 1933.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to the Under-Secretary that figures of this kind are misleading—I do not say intentionally—unless we also get the number of houses proposed, that is houses for which the land has already been secured and the foundations prospected, but as regards which no actual work has yet been done? If we could get the actual programme of houses as well as those under construction, we would know what we were likely to have at the end of 1933.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will understand the difficulty of getting a new set of figures at a moment's notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those figures for which I ask would place the Committee in a better position to judge of the merits of this Amendment and the necessity for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are under construction for the whole of Scotland, roughly, 8,000 slum clearance houses, and the number of those approved but not yet begun is between 600 and 700. Perhaps the Committee will excuse me while I verify that last figure. I am not sure that that is the right figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MAXTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be some doubt in the Department about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend is in office he will appreciate the difficulty of communicating with the permanent officials during a Committee sitting, when a special question of this kind is asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will make his permanent officials members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be a new constitutional method. However, I can now give the Committee the figures generally. The number of slum clearance houses under construction at 1st January was, roughly, 8,000 and the number approved but not yet begun on 1st January was, roughly, 2,000. Accordingly there are 10,000 houses to be taken off the programme of 21,500, leaving 11,500 not yet begun and not yet approved, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
be completed before the end of the year, if the programme is to be fulfilled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee will agree that we are indebted to the Under-Secretary who has shown his anxiety to give us all the information possible. I would like the Committee and the Under-Secretary to realise, however, what they are up against. The Scottish Office time and again has appealed to local authorities to go ahead with house-building, and no one has done that more than the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is going to further his idea of getting on with house-building and the resisting of the Amendment means that he is going to curtail house-building. There is no getting away from that fact. The hon. Gentleman seems not yet to have shed the influence that came upon him when he represented Perth, because Perth is the outstanding city in Scotland that refuses to go on with building new houses. When we asked that an inventory should be taken in Scotland in 1919 to see how many houses were required in each district, Perth refused to go on with any new houses. What they wanted was reconditioning of old houses, some of them 300 years old, and the Under-Secretary evidently is still trammelled with those ideas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must interrupt the hon. Member to say that whatever happened in 1919, Perth has been by no means inactive in housing schemes, with the result that a great number of admirable new houses have been built by the municipality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be said of the worst districts in Scotland that there are fine houses in those districts but there are also slums. That is one of my quarrels with the ruling class of my country. It would be different if they did not know how to build good houses, but they have always known how to build good houses. Those houses, however, were not for the working class. Those who lived in houses with from 6 to 10 rooms considered one room good enough for people of the working class in Scotland. There were always good houses in Perth and in Scotland generally. I do not know what is the position of the local authority at the moment in Perth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
but the Under-Secretary knows that there are authorities all over Scotland which will stop house-building on the least pretext. The interests of property owners are very strongly represented in this House. The property owners have tremendous influence in the Scottish Office. As I said at the last meeting of the Committee they sent a deputation and they stopped house-building in Clydebank, even after the town council by a majority had made an appeal that house-building should be gone on with. Here is an opportunity for the Scottish Office to justify their existence and to show that they are in earnest about going on with house-building. There is no doubt, however, that this Bill is going to break contracts and agreements whether written or otherwise. Agreements and understandings that have been made are going to be broken. No less a personage than the deputy town clerk of Glasgow, Mr. Mackenzie, informed me himself that there are agreements with Glasgow which the Scottish Office is going to break. That is no carried story and he has empowered me to use his name. That is what you are up against. It is not the Socialists or the agitators but the officials</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. MCKENZIE WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to express my regret that the Under-Secretary has not made any concession at all. He found it advisable to make a concession on Clause 2, and it seems to me there is exactly the same case for a concession on Clause 1. I think there is no doubt that there may be cases where local authorities have treated the Section referred to in my Amendment as a pledge, and that they have relied upon that pledge and must be involved in loss as a result; and I should have thought that the least the Government could have done would have been to make some provision so that local authorities would be indemnified from loss arising from taking the Government at its word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, "That those words be there added."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 8; Noes, 27.</p>
	<p>subsidy by the Department. Taking Glasgow as an example, Glasgow has bought some 96 acres, costing about £66,000, on which it was intended to erect 1,300 houses. These houses would fall within the category to which I am referring, and I suggest that in such cases the local authority should receive the subsidy. The other day, in Glasgow, I took the opportunity of finding out something more about these schemes, and I found that the submission of the plans, which are all ready, was delayed because of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
Department's very proper requirement that the scheme should be co-ordinated with the town planning scheme. Those who have had experience of town planning know that that is a necessary requirement of the Department. The delay, therefore, in submitting the plans, was not due to either the Department or the Government. I also found that the 96 acres consist of some 10 separate areas throughout the city, containing from 12 houses to some 350 houses. The type of house to be erected in all these areas is known as the intermediate, and consists of two-storey tenements for artisans. Although it is admitted that none of these schemes is for slum clearance, yet it is thought that the 1,300 houses to be erected might assist in relieving the overcrowding in other parts of the city.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMIESON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this Amendment. The 1,300 houses for which land has been bought were part of the houses included in the general statement made by the Corporation of Glasgow under the Act of 1930. The Under-Secretary has given us certain figures, but I think that, in considering this Amendment, it is important to have clearly before one the figures which the Glasgow Corporation proposed in that year. Those figures have nothing whatever to do with slum clearance. The Under-Secretary gave us figures in which slum clearance houses were mixed up, but slum clearance does not come under this Measure at all, and it seems to me to be perfectly irrelevant to any consideration of the questions with which we have to deal here. In 1930, the Glasgow Corporation proposed, in their three-year programme, to build 9,000 houses to abate over-crowding, and 3,000 to meet the growth of population—a total of 12,000. Of these there have been completed, in round figures, 3,600; there are in course of erection another 3,600; and the number approved but not began is 1,400. That leaves roughly 3,300. Towards the erection of these 3,300 houses, the Corporation of Glasgow have, as my right hon. Friend has said, purchased 96 acres of land at a cost of £56,000. That is a definite commitment entered into by the corporation of Glasgow. I do not care whether, in entering into that commitment, they were relying on what was regarded as being in the nature of a definite pledge, or whether it was not a definite pledge, but at any rate the local authorities were
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
led to believe that there would be no revision of the subsidy until October, 1933, and that anything that took place then would be something in the nature of a revision, and not a complete withdrawal. The Glasgow Corporation, therefore, relying on what took place between them and the Department, have definitely committed themselves to an expenditure of £56,000, and I think it would be only fair that that expenditure should be recognised by the concession asked for in this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am going to anticipate what the Under-Secretary will say. In the first place, he will probably say that these 96 acres can be used for slum clearance houses. As regards the greater part of that land, however, that is not the case. Some 22 acres, I believe, could be so used, but, as regards the rest, there are either building restrictions or the land has been town planned in such a way that houses suitable for slum clearance cannot be erected on it. The houses which have to be erected for slum clearance are of the tenement class, and for this reason, that, if you are going to displace the dwellers in slums, you have to provide them with houses at the cheapest possible rent, because you have to take into account the travelling expenses to which they will be put in travelling to and from the land, which is all more or less on the outskirts of the city. The greater part of this land, therefore, is not suitable for slum clearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate another point that my hon. Friend is going to make. He is going to isay that two portions of the land, each of some 20 acres, I think, were bought by the housing department from another department of the corporation itself, and that it was not really a purchase for housing purposes. In my submission, that will not do. It does not matter that the land may have been held by some other department of the corporation—the parks department, or the common good, or some other department. It has been bought by the housing department, the housing department have been debited with £56,000 for it, and they have to find that money by borrowing and paying interest out of the rates. They are charged with that amount, and it is perfectly irrelevant that they have bought it from some other department of the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
I desire to press the Amendment for this reason. The rates in Glasgow, as everyone knows, are very high, and, if the Corporation have to erect houses on this land with nothing but the £3 subsidy, that is going to put an additional burden on the ratepayers. The Under secretary, in his most able speech on the Second Reading of the Bill, said that under the £3 subsidy local authorities would only have to find a contribution of some £2 6s. 7d.—I think that that was the exact figure he gave. In the first place, however, that was based on a figure of 4s. which he took for rates. But what is the use of taking a figure of 4s. for rates when the owner's rates in Glasgow are 5s. 6d. in the pound, and Glasgow, as has been said already in this Committee to-day, is the largest city in Scotland? It is no use giving us calculations of that sort. From the best information that I can get, the £3 subsidy is not only going to entail upon local authorities, or, at any rate, the local authority in Glasgow, a contribution of as much as £4 10s., but a great deal more, though at present it is perfectly true that, with the £9 subsidy, they can more or less make ends meet as regards the newer houses. It was stated by the Under-Secretary that, over all, the contribution was £3 12s. For the purposes of my argument I will make him a present of that £3 12s., and will take it that the £9 is just paying its own way. But the rent which on an average is being got from the Wheatley houses is 10s. a week, all in, that is to say, £26 a year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You do not include rates in the 10s.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMIESON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I include rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is higher than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMIESON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many cases it is more, but I am taking £26 a year as the minimum figure for the rent that is being got now. But, under the 6s. rent proposed for the new houses, the rent without rates would come to a figure of £15 12s., and adding, for the occupier's rates, £5 8s., you get £21, or a loss in rent of £5. The difference between the £9 subsidy and the £3 subsidy is a further loss of £6, making a total of £11. Then we must allow for a difference in the rate of interest at which money can be borrowed. I take the difference at £4 10s., leaving a contribution by the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
authority of £6 10s. and not £4 10s. That is the position with which Glasgow is going to be faced as regard the new houses which they are under an obligation to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, it is a very small concession to ask that the old subsidy should still be applicable where the houses are built on land which has been acquired for the purpose. I do not know whether it affects other local authorities, but it is certainly a concession for which we are entitled to ask. I notice a certain hardening of the heart of the Under-Secretary in the interests of national economy which is absent from his real nature, but I would invite him to consider the position of the ratepayers and the rent payers in Glasgow. The result of this Bill will be to add to, not to take away from, the amount that Glasgow must spend on housing. At present it is something like £180,000 a year. This will add to the amount that must be spent by them, and every penny that is added to the rates for housing will accentuate the difficulty of the housing problem. I ask the Under-Secretary, in view of the figures I have given, if he cannot say anything about it to-day, to take time to consider whether he cannot see his way to make this small concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had two very interesting speeches and some interesting observations by the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchajian) when he was discussing the wider Amendment. The Amendment before us is that houses built on land already acquired for the purpose by local authorities should get the £9 subsidy. Both my hon. Friends dealt largely with the Glasgow situation, and many hon. Members have received information from Glasgow with regard to what we call the land situation there. Let me deal with the situation of Scotland as a whole, apart from Glasgow, because the Amendment is not confined to Glasgow, and observations were made by the hon. Member for Gorbals on the last Amendment dealing with Scotland as a whole. The Convention of Royal Burghs sent out a circular to their local authorities asking for a return of the amount of land that had be obtained and was not yet used, and with regard to which approval for house building had not been given. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
now have the result of that inquiry, which the Convention was kind enough to make available to the Department. Replies were received from 152 burghs. Out of that number, 136 replied that they had no commitments with regard to land of any sort. Of the remainder, 11 showed areas of land varying from 40 poles to 3½ acres. Let us take it at 3½ acres each so that we may not mis-state anything. Therefore, as far as the Convention of Royal Burghs was able to give information—and it was not a matter on which information was likely to be secreted—there were only 38½ acres at the outside, and, in fact, less with regard to which local authorities had commitments not covered by approvals already given. That does not say anything about how far the acres were available for slum clearance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DINGLE FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was the date of that inquiry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last month. It was a questionnaire with reference to this Amendment. It makes it abundantly clear that the local authorities are not making preparations in any way to complete the 1930 programme. The fact is that far from there being widely extended commitments in Scotland, there are none in 136 areas. In 11 there are at most commitments for over 38½ acres, and in fact less. So much for Scotland, apart from Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHN WALLACE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the other five areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They include Glasgow and such places as that, but I have no information about them. I will deal with that point more fully in a moment. Let me turn to Glasgow. The figures which have been given to-day were to the following effect. There are just short of 96 acres in the possession of the Glasgow Corporation which, according to my hon. Friends who put forward this Amendment, would come into the category of having been acquired by a local authority for the purpose of house building. I will deal with the 96 acres in a little detail. Take Blackhill, which amounts to 27 acres. The total is larger than that. The 96 acres refer only to ground which the corporation state is unsuitable for slum clearance building, and we exclude such ground. Therefore, if I say that Blackhill has 27 acres, every-
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
body knows that there are 22 acres more which, in the view of the corporation, is suitable for slum clearance. I am dealing only with acreage which is not suitable for slum clearance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMIESON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that the 22 acres suitable for slum clearance have no restriction. The other 27 acres have a restriction as to the number of houses per acre. It is residential property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely saying that if my figures in regard to a particular estate did not seem to be correct, that was the explanation. The 27 acres of Blackhill are part of the common good of Glasgow. It was not purchased by the corporation for the purpose of house building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position was that it was a golf course and there was a tremendous conflict in Glasgow before it was taken over. The Corporation was almost equally divided; one section said they had no right to take it, and that they ought to reserve it as a golf course. The Corporation on a vote deliberately took it over for housing. When that was done, it meant that the Corporation lost their golf course with its income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to so lengthy an interruption when I am dealing with the facts. The fact is that Blackhill, which has been in the possession of the Corporation for a long period, was not purchased by the Corporation for housing but for a golf course, and used as such for many years. I agree that it was taken over by the Housing Committee for housing purposes and paid for, but that was merely a bookkeeping transaction as between two departments of the Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even though it were only a book-keeping transaction, was not the land taken over by one department from another for the specific purpose of house building?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore it brings it within the category of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly it does not. The hon. Member must not suppose that I was assuming it was not intended for house building. I say that it belonged
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
to the Corporation and was not an ex pense to the Corporation. Let me take Bellahouston, which consists of 22 acres out of the 96. That was purchased be fore 1919 with a restriction upon the ground which, throughout the housing schemes of the Corporation, has made it impossible for the Department of Health, in the interest of economy, to sanction housing schemes on that site. The restriction on the ground makes it necessary that the houses should have stone fronts. The Corporation were warned against buying it, and even if the Amendment were passed, I cannot hold out any hope that the Department of Health would be in a position to allow such a scheme to proceed, because it in volves an expenditure on houses which would be of no benefit to the working class people who would live in them. It is simply a restriction which is intended to keep up the aesthetic tone of the district—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tut, tut!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to give way on each point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I cannot allow a discussion on the Blackhill land, because I understand that the Amendment would not cover it, as it was not acquired for the purposes of building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are wrong. We are, however, not discussing Black-hill now, but Bellahouston.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that Black-hill was not purchased by the local authority, but by a commitee of the local authority from the local authority. I am now dealing with Bellahouston. There are no grounds in the history of that site to give any colour to the view that a £9 subsidy would be paid on the houses erected there, because the Department, owing to the restriction on that site, have always found it impossible to approve of it. The next estate in importance of acreage is Hillington Park, which is responsible for 20 acres out of the 96. This site was bought in 1920 and was not approved then for 1919 houses. The 1919 houses have always housed what have been described as the aristocracy of the working-classes, and occasionally not working-class people at all, and I think
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
that the Committee would find it hard to justify the inclusion of those 20 acres for the purposes of 1924 houses when it was not even used in 1919.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with acreage amounting to 70 acres out of 96. I will not go into the smaller figures, but I would like to call attention to one. There is the unfortunate case of Coplawhill, which figures in the return at 2.23 acres. I am sorry to have to inform the Committee that here we come to what must be regarded as a grave state of affairs, because Coplawhill has been in the possession of the Glasgow Corporation not for the short period in which housing Acts have been in existence but for the last 200 years. I say to the Committee that although I quite appreciate the position of the town council of Glasgow, yet after giving the matter the most careful consideration, assisted by the returns kindly supplied by the Convention of Royal Burghs, I cannot see that there is any ground for supposing that we are here faced with commitments which would make it necessary for the amendment of the Bill. I have not gone into the question of how many of these Glasgow sites could be used for slum clearance replacement houses. Some can be, and with regard to one of the others there were negotiations between the corporation and a private building company for the purchase of it by the latter. If we are right in concentrating the attention of local authorities upon slum clearance, and relying for working-class houses either on the £3 subsidy or private enterprise, assisted by the provisions of Clause 3, I do not think there is any reason to suppose that a single half acre of the 96 acres, the details of which I have given to the Committee, will be left on the hands of the city incapable of use. In those circumstances, and in view of the fact that taking Scotland as a whole no commitments of any serious nature have been disclosed by the questionnaire, I urge the Committee not to ask me to agree to this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the information of the Under-Secretary respecting at least the Bellhouston area is entirely wrong. I quite agree that there are restrictions upon the portion of the land still left unbuilt on, but it must be perfectly well known that the land which has been acquired is completely laid out—the streets are laid out and the sewers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
are there and everything is ready for the house; and, as I am reminded by an hon. Member, it has been in that state for 15 years. If the restrictions as to the class of house to be built there are so stringent surely the Department could use its persuasive powers with those from whom the land was first acquired to secure a revision of the building term. The aesthetic conditions which are said to surround that particular place exist only in the imagination of the Scottish Department. There are two greyhound tracks there, and there is vacant land which is used for circuses and shows. In addition there has been a very large scheme for erecting houses for the decent type of artisan which extends right to the head of Craigdown Road and links up there with another scheme. A number of wooden huts were also erected there, and we want to get these people to leave their little wooden huts and get into something decent. To talk about restrictions placed on the type of building on account of the aesthetic character of the area is all eye-wash. I am not saying it is being put forward deliberately as eye-wash, but the information in the possession of the Department must be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Amendment ought to be accepted by the Government. It comes from their own supporters, and they have had facts submitted to them by the Corporation of Glasgow. Those of us who have lived in Glasgow know the conditions. I was born and brought up in that area and I do not think anyone will say that I am an aesthetic individual. An area which was good enough for me to live in and be educated in and spend the best part of my life in is a good enough one in which to erect houses which will suit anyone else. I think the Under-Secretary might reconsider this matter before Report stage and see whether anything can be done, in consultation with the Department and those who are in a position to influence matters, which would allow him to accept the principle of this Amendment, if not adopting the actual wording on the Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MAXTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the Amendment. I regret that the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Train) is not with us this morning, but presumably 100 per cent. of the Glasgow Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
are behind the Amendment. I think the form of it was suggested by the corporation, and I can assure hon. Members opposite that when they take it to a Division there will be 100 per cent. of the Members of this party who will vote for it. I always think the Under-Secretary proves his case so well that he makes the case for the opposition at the same time. He shows that the provision which Scotland has made for house building which will be affected by this Amendment is very trivial indeed. If that is so, the charge on the Exchequer for granting this concession to Scotland—which is always a great consideration with Ministers when deciding whether to concede or resist Amendments—would be relatively small. I have been working it out in my mind, roughly, and I do not think it would come to more than about £10,000 on the £9 basis as against the £3 basis. Certainly it would be a saving to the Treasury to have these houses provided on that basis rather than have the land used for slum clearance. To use the land for slum clearance purposes would be more expensive still. Ministers might make this concession without getting into any serious trouble with their paymasters downstairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Really, I am not very enthusiastic about this Amendment, because it shows the Glasgow Corporation in its most modest mood. Glasgow Corporation did not feel, presumably, that it could shout very loudly about subsidy reduction for all the rest of Scotland, but not for Glasgow. Even in Glasgow they cannot be quite so brazen as that. My friends and I would have preferred the somewhat bigger demands made in our own Amendments, one of which would continue the existing subsidy indefinitely. I notice that the Under-Secretary, in defending the builders against the Amendment, merely expressed the hope that the £3 subsidy, with the addition of the machinery in Clause 3, would provide enough houses to occupy the land that has already been taken. That is a tremendous "flop" from the great heights to which he soared during the Second Reading stage and in the earlier discussions in the Committee. Then he was away up in the mountain tops. He was surveying a promised land where the £3 subsidy in the hands of efficient building societies was going to cover the whole of Scotland with excellent houses. This
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
is a "sair coom doon"; to turn from Scotch to modern slang, it is a "flop," and I believe the Under-Secretary's speech just now took a more realistic view of what is going to happen in Scotland than his earlier ones in the House and in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the £3 subsidy will not produce more houses, will not meet the housing problem; I do not even believe that it will fill up the very limited amount of ground which the Under-Secretary described as having been taken off by the Glasgow Corporation. Having regard to the fact that it has been proved in this Committee that an honourable bargain was entered into, having regard to the fact that the cost involved in granting the concession would be trivial, having regard to the fact that the great Corporation of Glasgow has asked for this concession—and Glasgow does not ask much from the British Government—and above all, perhaps, having regard to the fact that two of the most loyal supporters of the Government have dared to venture forth as Daniels and put down an Amendment against their own Government, I ask the Government not to adopt the simple "Cannot do it" attitude, but to make a small concession in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMES REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the proposers of this Amendment or the Committee quite realise how extravagant it is. We are told that the total demand amounts to £56,000. Let us leave on one side the amount of that money which was spent long before 1924 and let us look at the position in 1932. We are told that there are to be 1,300 houses. At £9 per house for 40 years, I reckon that the total amount of subsidy which the Government are asked to give to the Glasgow Corporation in respect of that expenditure of £56,000 is no less than £468,000 spread over—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have to give them to the £3 house, anyhow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point if the hon. Member will give me time. If this ground can be used, as I think it can, for £3 subsidy houses then the £56,000 is not lost, because most of the land will come in useful and therefore I do not think that the interruption is relevant. But suppose that it is. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
subsidy under the £3 arrangement would amount to about £150,000 so that the additional charge on the Exchequer by retaining the £9 subsidy is at least £300.000. It seems entirely unreasonable that Glasgow Corporation should say, "Because we have spent £56,000, we are entitled to an additional £300,000 at least from the Exchequer." It is unreasonable that they should make that claim because they happen to have bought land at a time when other people did not do so. I do not believe that there is any loss of £56,000. The interruption of the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) makes it plain that these sites can be used, if not for slum clearance houses, at least for the £3 subsidy type of house, if they can be used for any subsidised type at all. If there is a loss, surely, this is not the right way to try to be recouped. If there is a loss the Glasgow Corporation ought to say, "We have spent £10,000 which we cannot recover and we want some concession which is worth £10,000." But they have no right to say, "We want a concession worth £300,000."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WALLACE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I heard the Mover and Supporter put forward their Amendment I thought they had made out an unanswerable case, but having heard the Under-Secretary, I am not quite so sure. I think the hon. Gentleman very largely torpedoed the position which they took up regarding this expenditure by Glasgow. If it can be established, as I think it has been, that this Blackhill site of 27 acres has not been a new expense to the corporation at all, and, if it is still represented that this has been expenditure for the purposes of housing then I am sure that there has been, quite unintentionally, some misrepresentation of the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WALLACE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can it be possible for the corporation to purchase its own common land? I should imagine that all the sacrifice which has been made by the city of Glasgow in this particular matter has been the park rent which the golf club paid for the use of that land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They had to provide alternative accommodation for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WALLACE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but that does not amount to purchase. I am only trying honestly and sincerely to get

	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
at the facts because it is on the facts that I shall have to decide how to vote. It seems to me that there has been no actual purchase and that the amount which has been stated as the amount of the purchase money has been wrongly inserted in the account of the matter which the Mover and Seconder gave. I am fully alive to the housing necessities of Glasgow. I lived there for some years and, knowing the conditions, anything that I could do to help by my vote in the direction of better housing I should be only too glad to do. But I like a case to be properly and fairly and squarely stated and I feel that that has not been the case in regard to this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Under-Secretary about the return from the inquiry which he had made to the Convention of Royal Burghs. He told us that 152 corporations had sent in replies but he only gave us 147 replies. I should like to know something about the others. For example, what about a great city like Dundee? Before this question goes to a Division we ought to have fuller particulars about these districts and if there is any further light to be cast on the Glasgow ease I should be very glad to know of it. In a matter of this kind where the legislation which we are considering is for the whole country, while Glasgow has very strong claims for better housing, it must be clear that a special preference can only be given to Glasgow, 	<i>qua</i> Glasgow, for the very soundest reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. MASON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot lay claim to the knowledge of Glasgow which is possessed by so many hon. Members who have spoken, but I have had a very close connection with Glasgow and I realise the housing conditions of that city. We are often told that there is great rivalry between Glasgow and Edinburgh, but on this occasion as representing a division of Edinburgh I generally support this Amendment and desire to help it in every way. I believe I can speak on behalf of other Edinburgh representatives in that, because we believe it will tend to relieve congestion in Glasgow. The Amendment, we are told, only involves a small cost. One hon. Member has put it at £10,000, though there is a difficulty in knowing the exact amount which it would add to the cost of this Measure. The Amendment has been proposed by an hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
Member of the Labour party and seconded by a Member of the Conservative party who I think will have many supporters among the other Members of his own party. I hope that my neighbour the hon. Member for West Edinburgh (Mr. Normand) will do a neighbourly action on this occasion and speak for this Amendment which, it would appear, entails only a very small addition to the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I feel that this Bill, which cuts down the subsidy, must, in the nature of things, make it very hard for the poorer section of the community to get houses. We all realise the financial state of the country and the straits in which the Government are to get money, but here surely is a case in which the expenditure of money would be reproductive. We are told that there is to be a campaign for slum clearance. That is held before us as an alternative to providing houses for the working classes. When the Under-Secretary speaks of aesthetic conditions, I do not think the working classes are looking so much to those conditions, but they do desire the provision of cheap houses, and it seems to me that the Bill will not provide the cheap houses which we hoped would be provided by private enterprise under it. If you withdraw or reduce your subsidy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have been listening carefully to the hon. Member. His remarks are of a general character which would apply to the whole Bill, and I must ask him to confine himself to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MASON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument is that this Amendment would widen the scope of the Bill by bringing within it this ground, and that any Amendment to widen the scope of the Bill ought to receive support from those who believe that the Bill is too narrow, and that with the reduction of the subsidy it cannot provide houses for the poorer classes of the community. After all, the Amendment embodies a very modest request, and I do not think that any concessions have been made to us so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, you could hardly see them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MASON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would appeal to the Secretary of State and to the Under-Secretary to consider this Amendment, and if they cannot agree to it—though possibly we might carry it—at least to hold out some hope that it will receive consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise for the purpose of answering one or two points which have been raised. There is a difference between the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk (Mr. Reid) and the hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) as to the cost involved. Apparently the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk takes the capital cost and the hon. Member for Bridgeton takes the annual cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REID</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) puts it at £10,000 a year for 40 years, and in that case he agrees with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so, but the way in which the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk put it—I do not say he did it intentionally—would have led one to think that he meant £300,000 per annum. [HON. MEMBEES: "No!"] It could have been taken in that way. I took it in that way and I think I am as capable of understanding and following Parliamentary arguments at least as the hon. Gentleman who interrupts. However, I wish to get the point clear. It now appears that the hon. Member for Bridgeton is agreed that it is £10,000 per annum and that the other hon. Member meant his figure as a capital sum. I do not wish to see a product of Glasgow University differ from a product of Edinburgh University and as one who does not belong to either university, I want to put things right between them. Therefore, it is the case that £10,000 per annum is the loss and that is what Glasgow Corporation is asking for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Wallace) made the case that the corporation owned Blackhill through its parks department and that it let Blackhill as a golf course. The corporation did let it for the purposes of the citizens using it to play golf but the corporation then decided that it should be taken over for housing. While they did not wish to deprive people of golf they considered that site very convenient for housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
those people for whom houses of this type are built. It enables those people to get to and from their work easily. It was decided that it was better that this site should be used for housing and another site acquired for golf. The result was that the Glasgow Corporation decided to sell this ground to the housing department, and the parks department, with the money acquired from the sale, have to get a new golf course and re-equip it. If the Glasgow Corporation do not get this money, the commitment to get the golf course remains the same, but, instead of it being a Government charge, it will be a charge on the local rates. It would be all right if there were no golf course to be replaced, but a definite commitment to replace the golf course has been entered into, and I have no doubt that, even if the Government meet the subsidy as suggested here, the corporation will lose on the transaction. I am speaking from recollection, but I think that the Blackhill course was one of our pre-War courses, and, consequently, was set out when things were much cheaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary was slightly unfair with regard to the Coplawhill site. I think he gave the Committee the impression that the site had been purchased for a period of 200 years, but let us try to get the facts right. This ground belonged, I believe, to what is called the Hutchison Trust, through the corporation, and adjacent to the Coplawhill site there are public baths. On this site there are already houses—huts, wooden houses. If the Glasgow Corporation had done what they did in my division, where also the ground had been bought long ago, and had agreed to pull those houses down some months earlier, they would have got the subsidy. The reason why they have not got the subsidy on this site is not the period of 200 years, but the fact that, these people being already housed in huts, the Glasgow Corporation, rightly, said that, as these huts were still good for a few years, they would leave the people in their homes for the present, and would build where it was more necessary during the present year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funny thing about it is that on some of the ground there are other corporation houses which have been built under the subsidy. Indeed, at Blackhill, one half of the ground comes under the slum clearance subsidy, while the other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
half is being cut out here. The Under-Secretary says that the houses would possibly be built under the other arrangement, but the loss remains the same. There has been no answer to the well taken point of the hon. and learned Member for Maryhill (Mr. Jamieson). He agrees with us that there will be this loss. The difference is that it is proposed to transfer it to the Glasgow Corporation, and that is a point which has never been met. It is true that £3 subsidy houses may be built on this ground, but the Glasgow Corporation is to be asked to bear the whole burden on its local rates. I think that that would be both unfortunate and unfair. The adoption of this Amendment would only cost a very meagre amount, and we ask that it be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Bellahouston I have put a lot of questions already, because the contractor who is probably going to get the job when the houses are built comes from my division, and I was very anxious to get some people there a job. I feel certain that the Under-Secretary will now enter into arrangements with the proprietors there for the drawing up of a new set of conditions. The whole district has changed, and I am certain that the proprietors would rather have decent working class dwellings there than many of the other things that could be forced upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DINGLE FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible to have some answer from the Under-Secretary to the question put by the hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. J. Wallace)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first place, let me deal with Bellahouston. I think nobody has refuted the fact that there are restrictions in the feu charter, and, therefore, it is not in the power of the corporation or of the Department of Health to do anything in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proprietors can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the hon. Member's point, and will deal with it. My first observation was that the restriction is in the feu charter, and that, therefore, it is not in the power of the Department or the Corporation to break the feu charter. I have no information that the superiors are prepared to break it, but, even if they were, I think—my hon. Friends who are more actively engaged
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
in legal practice will correct me if I am wrong—that the point of a valid restriction in a feu charter is that the other feuars have the right to insist upon its maintenance, unless it has been abandoned, and that has not been stated to be the case here. Although it is clear that there may be certain temporary erections, and even temporary greyhound racing and so on, when it comes to the question of permanent buildings, this is, I understand, a residential district, where the houses actually erected have been of the class with stone fronts and all the rest of it. I do not know if my hon. Friend is aware of the exact limitations of this particular feu. There may well be houses of that class in the "district which you might call Bellahouston—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. MACLEAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon; I know the place well. On the other side of the Paisley Road, right facing the vacant ground to which he is referring, where these restrictions are imposed, there is a building scheme which has already been put up by the Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be, but not necessarily on the part of the Bellahouston estate that is feued under these restrictions. I must not waste the time of the Committee on these small details, but the fact is that there are building restrictions which have been imposed in the interests of other feuars, and it is impossible for the Corporation, the Department or the superiors to waive those restrictions without the consent of every feuar who has built on that estate under the restrictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JAMIESON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do those restrictions apply to the whole of the 22 acres?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that they do. We are now getting into matters of detail to which, even in Committee, there should be limits, but I cannot undertake to review the situation again. The matter has been very carefully considered. The fact is that every one of these concessions, had they been given, would, in so far as they were effective or would have produced houses built under a £9 subsidy, would have deflected local authorities from getting on with slum clearance. At an earlier stage I gave the Committee figures showing that there still remains a large number of slum clearance houses to be provided
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
under the Act of 1930. Is the policy of this Committee going to be to concentrate the attention of local authorities upon slum clearance, or are we going to divert that attention and give them a £9 subsidy, the value of which is considerably greater now than when it was introduced by Mr. Wheatley?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my submission, it is not possible to have it both ways. I would ask the Committee to make up their mind to concentrate upon slum clearance. Let them recollect that, in the case of the Glasgow estates, if certain portions of the 96 acres are unsuitable for slum clearance, it has never been suggested that they are not suitable for £3 subsidy houses. Let us recollect that, under Mr. Wheatley's proposals, the local authority would have to pay £4 10s. for these 1924 houses, but the average cost to Glasgow has not been £4 10s., but £3 12s. Let us, therefore, say, with regard to that acreage, that, if there are certain small parts which cannot be used for slum clearance, it is not too much to ask the Glasgow Corporation to make use of them for £3 subsidy houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of my hon. Friend, the Member for Dunfermline (Mr. J. Wallace), I do not know that I will weary the Committee with the questions that he raised—[HON. MEMBERS: "Yes!"] I will give the reply of Dundee to the questionnaire of the Convention of Royal Burghs, as to the amount of land acquired for the purposes of the Act of 1924 which will not be used for the purposes of the Act of 1930, and the amount acquired in 1931 or 1932, that is to say, after the issue of the Circular. Dundee replied that there were no commitments except that the Corporation said that it had certain lands which it was not possible to use, and that they were acquired for the 1924 Act. I have made certain that, of the other 136 which I described as having no commitments, none refer to land bought for other purposes except the 1924 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to apologise for not having dealt with the remaining five cases. In two of these, the land acquired is actually less than the amount needed to accommodate the houses already approved; in one case no particulars were given; the fourth case is that of Glasgow; and the fifth case is that of Clydebank, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
has bought 39 acres of land, in the case of which, however, as regards the building of £9 subsidy houses, the Department has already refused to agree to the scheme. The matter came before my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Caithness (Sir A. Sinclair) and myself when he was at the Scottish Office. I do not want to enter into the subject discussed by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. Kirkwood), but simply to show that, as at present advised, the Department could not approve of that land being used for £9 subsidy houses, even if the subsidy had not been altered. I will not go into the argument now. Questions have often been put in the house about it, and at a suitable time I shall be prepared to discuss it in full, but that fifth case is not one which is relevant to this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I urge my hon. Friends to keep in view the policy of the Government and the policy at the back of the Bill, and to emphasise it to the local authorities? It is the policy of concentrating upon that large number of slum clearance houses which have not yet been begun under the 1930 programme. I do not think that the Committee can have it both ways, and, in view of the fact that the vital thing in Scotland is slum clearance, I urge them not to ask us to spend the money of the State on purposes other than slum clearance and the provision of houses for low-paid wage earners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MCGOVERN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary, I think, would have been well advised to accept this Amendment, but, of course, we must bow to his decision by carrying our objection to a Division. In spite of what he has said this morning, the Glasgow Corporation are very hypocritical in this Amendment. I do not suggest that the people of Glasgow should be penalised for the inefficiency and incapacity of the corporation, but I do say that the corporation have not faced up to their responsibility to get on with housing within the last three years. Nobody is to blame but the corporation for not providing the number of houses required, and when they suggest an Amendment of this character, it is hypocrisy after they have passed a resolution approving a reduction in the subsidy. If the Government could have accepted the Amendment and given

	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BUCHANAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a new point. Under the Clause the Government are substituting a £3 subsidy for a £9 subsidy so that they are still carrying on the principle of the subsidy. It is the Government's duty to see that certain conditions are carried out and they have no right to grant a subsidy unless proper conditions are made. I do not think that we have fully realised that if we provide houses we provide useful work as well. The subsidy can be paid to people who might not properly pay the employés who are engaged in the building, and it would be a tragedy if men working on houses did not receive the remuneration to which they were entitled while the people who built the houses got the subsidy. I have a case in mind, and the reason that I did not put down an Amendment was that I could make an appeal to the Government between now and the Report stage to put down an Amendment or to give us some guarantee. At Cardonald 32 men have been engaged for weeks building houses, and the sub-contractor went away without paying the men, and yet the subsidy is going to be paid on those houses. I maintain that the men are entitled to get their wages before anybody gets. Government money. Here is a case where the sub-contractor goes away and the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>main contractor refuses to pay the men. I hope that the Government will try to meet such a situation by an Amendment, and to take powers to see that no Government subsidy is paid before legitimate wages due to the men engaged in building are met.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Sir Godfrey Collins)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recollect that the hon. Member raised this point in a question in the House last week. It struck me that it was a matter that deserved consideration, and the Under-Secretary is inquiring into it. An Amendment of the character which the hon. Member has indicated, however, would be outside the scope of the Bill. The Title of the Bill is to provide for the reduction of subsidies. We are, however, inquiring into it and will communicate with the hon. Member as soon as possible. I have no desire to intervene at this stage, for I am anxious to secure the passage of Clause 1 to-day. In view, however, of the fact that the Clause reduces the subsidy from £9 to £3, I would like to say that the Department and the Government appreciate to the full the drive which local authorities have made during the last nine years in erecting houses. I know they are concerned as to the reduction of the subsidy, which may lead to a reduced number of houses, but the cost of house building is falling. Even in

January, 1933, the price still shows a reduction compared with January, 1932. I would appeal this morning to local authorities, while keeping slum clearance in the forefront of their programme, to drive forward with all possible speed with subsidies under Clause 1. There is a further point which was raised by the senior Member for Dundee (Mr. Dingle Foot). Last week the word "pledge" was used, and I thought it well to get the exact copy of the letter sent to the town council of Dundee, dated 11th December, 1931.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. COLLINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to suggest that the Committee adjourn until Thursday next. I might mention to my colleagues that some weeks ago I made engagements to be present in Edinburgh on Thursday, and I hope they will excuse my absence in view of those engagements, for I well know that I can leave this Bill in the capable hands of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my colleagues here I would ask the Committee not to meet on Thursday next. We cannot be here; we shall be in Scotland. We would like it very much if the Government would agree to the Committee meeting next Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped very much that the Bill would be completed by the following Tuesday, that is to say, with two further Sittings of the Committee.

The period of 1st October, 1933. I hope in view of the specific words that we are giving £9 for houses completed before 1st October, 1933, that my colleagues will agree with me that no pledge has been broken. With this explanation, I hope the Clause may now be agreed to.</p>
	<p>Question put, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 21; Noes, 9.</p>
	<p>portant series of engagements in Scotland for the following Thursday, the 23rd. Both my right hon. Friend and I are always very unwilling not to meet the wishes of Members of the Committee on a question of this sort. Is it the case that the greater number of hon. Members above the Gangway opposite cannot be present?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KIRKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be only one present. I am here after travelling from Scotland all last night, and I travel back to-night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Committee adjourned at Fourteen Miniutes after One o'Clock until Tuesday, 21st March at Eleven o'Clock.</p>
