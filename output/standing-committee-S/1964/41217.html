</ol></p></blockquote>
During the debate on Second Reading, I mentioned the curious circumstances on the River Don where the river was clean to all intents and purposes until its tidal reaches, where conditions became very bad and where a great nuisance was suffered by those living on the banks. This caused me to devote a great deal of thought and research to this matter. At this stage, I should like to express my indebtedness to the Federation of British Industries for the expert advice which it gave me on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances in a tidal part of a river may be entirely different from those in the fresh water part. The purpose of the Amendment is to underline the necessity for the river purification authorities to treat tidal waters differently from fresh waters. The Bill seems to be defective in this respect as compared with the corresponding English Act which contains a statutory provision in almost exactly the same terms as my Amendment. The English provision was introduced on Report into what was then Clause 1(3) of the 1961 Measure after considerable thought had been given to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that an estuary is very different from the fresh water part of a river in that there are sometimes two flows of water simultaneously, the fresh water coming down and the salt water coming in from the sea. Generally speaking, the effect is that the flows are stratified. Generally speaking, although not always, the salt water is below the fresh water so that certain parts of the river may have a comparatively fast flow of water seawards whereas in other parts of the estuary there is a reverse flow. Obviously, if a discharge is made into the reverse flow, serious effects may follow. What I want to do is to underline the necessity for the purification authorities to keep these matters in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that there is a chemical reason for the nuisance which occurs in the tidal part of the River Don. It is that the sulphates in the river coming with the salt water do not absorb oxygen to the same degree as in the fresh water, so that sulphates become sulphites. This is beyond my comprehension but I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
told that sulphide of hydrogen stinks like anything. That is the cause of the trouble. This sort of nuisance will not be cured unless thought is given specifically to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in the course of their operations the river authorities will keep these matters in mind, but in considering the Scottish legislation it is proper for this Committee to follow the English precedent which gives river boards in England and Wales some guidance about the carrying out of their duties in estuaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first sight, it would seem perfectly reasonable to accept the Amendment and certainly its intentions are in line with the idea of the Bill. Nevertheless, to accept the Amendment would distort the Bill in ways which the hon. Gentleman does not intend. The Amendment is a replica of Section 9(4) of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961, on estuaries and tidal waters, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged. This section provides that in performing any functions under that Act, or Section 7 of the 1951 Act, which is analagous to Section 28 of the 1951 Scottish Act, river boards shall have special regard to the interests of sea fisheries and to the factors arising from the tidal nature of the waters and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has to be borne in mind that river boards in England, unlike river purification authorities, have fisheries functions. Paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> of the Amendment was originally included in the Clean Rivers (Estuaries and Tidal Waters) Act, 1960, following representations from the Federation of British Industries similar to those which the hon. Gentleman has had, who were concerned to ensure that control over new outlets and discharges to tidal—that is, controlled—waters would result in the same standards being applied to these as to inland waters. Many large industries have been, and will increasingly have to be, set up near tidal waters to enable them to dispose of difficult industrial effluent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is not appropriate to Scotland as regards fisheries, and this is one of its defects. It is not so appropriate because the purification
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
authorities do not have fisheries functions as such in tidal, or controlled, or inland waters. As it stands, the Amendment would have that first objection. The Amendment uses the phrase, "special regard to the interests of sea fisheries". That may be read solemnly, but also as a pious expression of hope. These things can be interpreted differently. Admonitions should be more solid than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is probably reading a previous version of the Amendment. The word "sea" does not appear in the Amendment on the Order Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly fair, but the Amendment could be read as meaning that in dealing with tidal waters the authorities should deal with sea areas. It is therefore not unreasonable to talk about the interests of sea fisheries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will agree that some fisheries are extremely important. The salmon is both a sea fish and a river fish, and the passage of salmon up and down the estuaries is a matter of great importance to some parts of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree and the hon. Gentleman will recollect that on Tuesday we had a discussion on a batch of Amendments when I gave a specific undertaking that a difficulty which arose because of a conflict between two Acts passed in the same year concerned with river purification and salmon fisheries would be resolved by the Government in a later Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> of the Amendment is easily the more important of the two paragraphs. We are asked to pay special regard to factors arising from the tidal nature of the waters. This would affect the functions of the authorities as expressed in the Bill and in the 1951 Act. Read strictly, the Amendment would mean that in considering conditions to be imposed on discharges to heavily polluted tidal waters, such as the waters of the Clyde, from the Clyde to Broomielaw, river purification authorities would have to have special regard to those waters and therefore impose conditions stricter than normal. I am sure that that is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
result which the hon. Gentleman does not intend. On the other hand, discharges from large electricity generating stations, such as those at Hunterston, Kincardine and Cockenzie, would not merit such strict conditions as would be enforced in narrower or more polluted waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore back to the provisions in the Bill which empower purification authorities to impose such conditions as they "may think fit"—Clause 1(3). The Committee will remember that we had a long argument about this. This is one major distinction between the Scottish and the English legislation which some hon. Members opposite do not like. Nevertheless we have agreed that we prefer our wording. Our wording gives a larger area of discretion to the boards and to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the strict answer which I must give to the hon. Gentleman is that the purification authorities can best be left to exercise their judgment, subject to there always being a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. I hope that the Committee will therefore not accept the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the minor criticism that the Amendment as drafted would apply to the authorities, but not to the Secretary of State on appeal. The Amendment is faulty in that respect. Another point is that on an earlier Amendment the hon. Member and some of his hon. Friends argued in favour of the exemption of agriculture. I am glad to say that that proposal was negatived rather than taken to a Division. The case for such an exemption was not as sound as originally appeared. This would, in a sense, be an exception designed for industry. As such, it would break the principle of the Bill, which seeks to apply as fairly as possible to every sector of the community—industry, agriculture, fishing and the general public as well as the interests of the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member and I spoke about this matter on Tuesday and I went into it thoroughly. I have gone into every way in which we could rephrase the Amendment, perhaps dropping "fisheries" and rephrasing paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> Originally this
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
morning, I intended to say that I would reconsider the matter, but on reflection I feel that there is no way in which I could do so without offending against some of the points which I have made. I am sorry, therefore, to have to counsel the Committee not to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has explained clearly the reason for his Amendment and I should like to say a few words on paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> Whether or not the wording of the Amendment is faulty, its principle is one to which the Committee must pay considerable attention. I was glad to hear certain assurances from the Under-Secretary of State that the different situation in tidal waters is accepted and would be taken into account. I hope that those words will remain on the record for any Secretary of State who may find himself faced with decisions about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot refrain from mentioning the point put by my hon. Friend about hydrogen sulphide, which, one is reminded, is H	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->S, the substance which small boys use in missiles known as stink bombs, also known as sulphuretted hydrogen. Certainly, we would not wish this to be distributed over the tidal waters, although I must in passing mention that it occurs in waters at certain spas where people go for health purposes but, no doubt, only in small quantities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points made by my hon. Friend concerning tidal waters are valid. There is a difference. To give just three examples, there is the flow of water in both directions, there is the degree of salt and its effect upon neutralising certain effluents and there are also currents. From memory, I believe that there is a large working model at the University of Strathclyde, either still under construction or now completed, of the Firth of Forth. It has been constructed with financial assistance from the Government and will give great assistance to the South of Scotland Electricity Board concerning Longannet and also the Kincardine power station which is already in use. The earlier reference to power stations was not made by me, as the Under-Secretary suggested, but I mention them now because I recognise that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
on the Firth of Forth in particular there will be these two large power stations and they will, I presume, discharge effluent in the form of heated water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So will Cockenzie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Cockenzie also. Therefore, the whole question of currents, temperatures and effects of tides in these firths is a matter for study. We do not yet know all the answers. These matters raise highly technical questions which still require a great deal of study. I therefore welcome as far as the Under-Secretary has gone his recognition that there is a special problem here. I hope that the Committee will recognise it also. Whether or not the actual wording of the Amendment is faulty, this is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like clarification of what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said in reply to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), who moved the Amendment. I do not think it necessary to adopt the Amendment, but I understood my hon. Friend to say that if it were accepted it would mean giving special attention to particular places. If there are polluting influences in any tidal or inland water, if the river purification board does its job it will pay particular attention to them. If they are influences which make the position more difficult because of changes in current or the ebb and flow of the tide, this would be something which the river board would need to tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions might arise to an extent which would kill off the fish. I do not understand the distinction of fisheries as against angling. I do not know whether commercial netting as against rod and line angling takes place on the Don. If the problem was similar to that of the Tay, I could understand it. In either case, if the value of salmon netting as a commercial proposition was destroyed, this would be equal to destroying the value of a river or tidal stretch where salmon or sea trout were caught by other means. I hope, therefore, that I am correct in my assumption that if influences causing pollution to the extent of the destruction of fish or any other life were apparent, the river purification board
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
would automatically take action under Clauses 1 to 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) in what he said about fishing interests. I accept what the Under-Secretary of State has said, but I ask him particularly to bear in mind the interests of sea fishing as well as of river fishing, because on the coasts of Scotland and in many of the areas scheduled in the Bill and shown on the map there are important sea-fishing as well as freshwater fishing interests. These should be taken into consideration in any interpretation of the Bill. I merely endorse what has been said about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say much more, but it seems to me that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) has to a certain extent misunderstood the position. I may not have made myself clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was quite clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pointed out that pollution might take place if a discharge is made in certain parts of an estuary but that the same pollution would not occur if the discharge were made into other parts of the estuary, because of the different nature of the waters there. As to the passage of fish, it may be possible for fish to pass up certain parts of an estuary, whereas other parts of an estuary constituted a great nuisance. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State also appreciates this point and will take it into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise two or three points about the Clause as amended. It is an important Clause which affects large areas of tidal water and in a comparatively few words it covers what could be a great deal in operation. To frame my questions more easily, I should like to refer to two stages, as I have done before, stage one being the new discharges and altered outlets—that is to say, what was done under the 1951 Act—and stage two being the existing discharges. I mentioned two of the points when discussing the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
package of Amendments to the Clause and in that way I have been able to give the Under-Secretary a certain amount of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point concerns subsection (2). Unless the first stage has already been started by an order under Section 29 of the 1951 Act, I understand that the first part of subsection (2) will have the effect of applying in due course stage one to the tidal waters scheduled in Schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the second part of subsection (2), commencing with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"but the Secretary of State may"</p></blockquote>
after the semicolon in line 43, would give the Secretary of State discretion to apply stage two to the tidal waters which have passed through stage one. I merely seek confirmation that that is the part of the Clause which gives the Secretary of State discretion to bring in stage two to particular tidal waters when he thinks that this should be done. It gives him discretion to do it and discretion on timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous discussions, we nave mentioned what the period might be. We recognise that there may be difficulties in one firth which do not arise in another. Therefore, we do not suggest that the timing should be an exact number of years. To that extent, we welcome the discretion which appears to be given. Again, however, I should like confirmation that that is the interpretation of the subsection and an indication from the Under-Secretary of the sort of time which he would expect to elapse between stages one and two. If he cannot indicate the timing, perhaps he can state the kind of difficulties which prevent him from doing so and whether he thinks that three, four or five years or more is the right sort of interval between stages one and two for these tidal waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subsection (3) resulting from the Amendments which have been made to the Clause gives the Secretary of State power, I understand, to bring into the system any other firth or tidal waters which are not at present mentioned in Schedule 3 or have not already, under the 1951 Act, been brought into the
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
system and into stage one. Am I right in thinking, as I suggested at our last meeting, that this is a subsection with the purpose of enabling the Secretary of State to bring into stage one, and later into stage two, any firth or tidal waters which might become threatened by pollution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the diagram which has been helpful in showing us the areas of tidal waters which are covered in Schedule 3. I presume that the new subsection (3) is necessary in case a firth in, perhaps, North-West Scotland which at present is pure and unpolluted might, as a result of development, be in a different state in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that on an earlier occasion the hon. Gentleman mentioned that besides the Firth of Forth and the Solway Firth there were some other tidal waters which were the subject of orders under Section 29 of the 1951 Act. It could have been a slip on his part but at our last meeting he said that the Clyde was the only other one which had not been considered, but he mentioned that there were others including one for Banff, Moray and Nairn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said was in relation to the immediacy; that is to say, the matter had been considered, the draft order had been published, the objections had been raised, the inquiry had been held, the report had been sent to the Secretary of State and my right hon. Friend had decided, or was about to decide, to sign the order. That applied only to the Clyde. In relation to the others, the Findhorn—that is Banff, Moray and Nairn—orders had been published but objection had not been laid, and in the case of the Dee and the Don matters were at a much earlier stage. The other order which we mentioned earlier was also at an earlier stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point clear. I do not want to ask for a complete situation report on all the others, but I would ask the hon. Gentleman to give us the names of the other tidal waters which are being dealt with under the 1951 Act at present and, therefore, before this Bill will become enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my intervention just now the only one which I did not mention was the Tweed, which slipped my memory for a moment. We have not conducted public inquiries on either the Findhorn Order, the Dee and the Don or the Tweed. This is why we were so definite in our argument about the Clyde which is in a rather different stage of development. This is why we resisted the attempt on Tuesday to try to have an order for the Clyde under the 1951 Act promulgated by the Secretary of State and therefore brought under this Bill as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is complicated, as the hon. Member has made clear. In my understanding, in the kind of shorthand in which I have tried to appreciate the situation under the Bill, it seems to me that hon. Members should try to visualise four definite designations of outlets. These are a new discharge, an altered discharge, a noxious discharge and an old discharge. I am willing to try to break these up into stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I am using shorthand and that this would not be valid in law as I am putting it. I emphasise again that there is a new outlet, being a new discharge, there is an altered discharge, there is a noxious discharge—"poisonous, noxious and polluting" is the phrase in section 22 of the original Act—and also there is an old discharge, that is a discharge before 1951. Under the 1951 Act we had to divide the waters concerned into rivers and tidal waters. Under that Act, tidal waters are defined as those for which an order had been promoted and there were two—the Forth and the Solway. New, altered and noxious discharges, but not old discharges, were covered in relation to rivers, but in relation to tidal waters as I say, we had to pass an order to cover new, altered and noxious discharges. We could have done that in relation to the River Clyde if we had promoted a River Clyde order. If immediately after he came into power the Secretary of State had signed that order it would have meant that new, altered and noxious discharges in the Clyde could have been brought under the 1951 Act. But this Bill automatically on its passage into law, if it stands as at present constructed, will mean that in relation to rivers, as in the case of tidal waters covered by existing orders, we will complete the four by automatically adding
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
old discharges. This is the argument which we had about the Clyde the other day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 34 control orders specified in the Bill will concern themselves with two discharges, the new and the altered, and at a later stage, by means of Clause 8(4), we are able to add noxious discharges and old discharges. But there is no complete coincidence between controlled waters and tidal waters, as I indicated to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) the other day, and the significance of the Government's Amendment was that the Secretary of State would have a right to promote an order which extended itself beyond the controlled waters laid down in the Bill. If a tidal waters order was promoted, it would be promoted under the Bill and the 1951 Act and we would then bring under control the four categories; that is, there would be complete control of new, altered, noxious and old discharges, to complete the picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in this shorthand I have succeeded in imparting to the Committee some understanding of the sequence. It is obvious that the Government are not being slow in the adoption of the method. Any criticism in terms of slowness must be of the operation of the method. It can be fast or slow, depending upon the willingness of those who want to use it. The method is particularly good because it allows the various balance of interests to put themselves in a favourable position to meet the requirements of the Bill in this sequence, with their particular understanding of the special problems of different industries and agriculture and of different sections of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on Tuesday the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Campbell) was kind enough to give me notice of the points which he has raised today. On the Amendment in page 9, line 11, the hon. Member asked whether the river purification authorities are able and willing to take on these new responsibilities for tidal waters. The answer is that we have had from the Association of River Purification Boards confirmation that they are anxious and willing to do this. Nevertheless, I cannot say that this is true of the river purification authorities. I do not know at this stage. These are local authorities banded together for these purposes rather than a direct board. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
cannot speak for them. All I can say is that the general feeling and the response from members of local authorities is that they are as anxious as the boards are to get on in the context of their own problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked if I would confirm whether in the second part of subsection (2) the operative words are
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Secretary of State may by order direct …"</p></blockquote>
The answer is "Yes", and to the hon. Member's question on the new subsection (3) the answer is again "Yes". I am glad to give these assurances and I hope that he and I in our remarks have made matters clear for those who have been trying to understand the complexities of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman give any indication of the timing, or is that too difficult? Can he foresee the sort of interval that there will be between the stages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather difficult to be precise about these things. Once we get the Bill through both Houses, if that is possible quickly, I have no doubt that the Department will want to turn its attention to the various orders and see whether it is possible to meet some of the difficulties with the orders. Once that is settled we shall have to redraft the orders in relation to the new Act as well as the principal Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall go ahead as fast as we can. I am informed that it is too difficult to make any estimate. Certainly, with the new legislation which we envisage, the Department has a heavy load to carry quite apart from the work of the river purification boards and the river purification authorities who, after all, are the pacemakers even if the Government were the most willing persons ever to promote the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I apologise to the Joint Under-Secretary for giving him rather short notice of the Amendment by tabling it only a few days ago. I hope that the shortness of the notice will not prejudice its possible acceptance. It is certainly a matter that merits acceptance. I am quite sure that if the hon. Gentleman has done as much homework on it, and as thoroughly, as I have he will agree that it should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Docks and Harbour Authorities Association which brought this point to my notice. I only wish that there had been more time to have passed round all the background information which makes clear that the Amendment is desirable. I am as anxious as anybody to see that this legislation should be passed with the minimum delay. It is a good Bill and I understand that there are hopes that we might finish the Committee stage today. I understand that the English equivalent Bill was passed in one morning, but of course the English are not as thorough as we are in improving legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be as precise as possible in my opening remarks, and give the Under-Secretary the chance of saying that he will accept the Amendment in the hope that it will not be necessary for me to spend more time in expanding my arguments later. I suspect that those who drafted the Bill would have incorporated the Amendment if it had been brought to their attention earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment is to avoid the difficulties that arise when two pieces of legislation overlap one another. I am, of course, referring to the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955, as amended by the Act of 1963. The important point is that this legislation was passed in order to give effect to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. It gives the masters of ships certain special defences to proceedings taken against them, and these were laid down and agreed internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
These defences would not be available under the 1951 Act, the Act for the prevention of pollution in Scotland, as amended by the present Bill. This would be tantamount to flouting internationally-agreed rules. In the short time in which the Government have been in office, they have not exactly endeared themselves to our foreign friends in Europe or other parts of the world, and I think that denial of this Amendment would give them further cause for annoyance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past the Scottish Office, as far as I can discover from my researches, has expressed the view that the 1955 Oil in Navigable Waters Act did not limit the scope of operation of the 1951 Act. This, as the Committee no doubt remembers, originally applied only to streams and was extended to tidal waters only by orders made by the Secretary of State under Section 29. In view of the terms of the Convention, which was the basis for the 1955 Act, it is submitted that the defences which are internationally agreed should not be left to evaluation by the courts, as would be the case under the 1951 legislation, as amended or extended by the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea was held in London in 1954, and Article III, which is subject to Article IV, lays down the requirement that ships are not to discharge or allow oil to escape into the sea. Article IV provides that Article III shall not apply to certain discharges, including:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(a)</i> the discharge of oil or of an oily mixture from a ship for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship, preventing damage to the ship or cargo, or saving life at sea; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(b)</i> the escape of oil, or of an oily mixture, resulting from damage to the ship or unavoidable leakage, if all reasonable precautions have been taken after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the leakage, for the purpose of preventing or minimising the escape."</p></blockquote>
These safeguards for shipping have been internationally agreed and would be overruled by this present legislation. I think that the Under-Secretary of State would agree that shipping is in a slightly different position from that of other organisations and bodies which it is intended to bring within the scope of this Bill. I think they are in a peculiar position, and deserve to be treated under the 1955 Oil in Navigable Waters Act as
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
Amended by the 1963 Act, because this is designed specifically to meet their particular situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know under which piece of legislation a prosecution would actually take place. Would it be the 1955 Act or the legislation which we are now endeavouring to pass? I think this is very important, because if it is not desired to make a prosecution under our present legislation which we are trying to pass in this Bill, this Amendment should be accepted. If it is intended to prosecute under this Bill, we are denying our friends overseas the protection legislation which had already been produced as a result of an international convention, and based on points which were internationally agreed. I hope very seriously that the Under-Secretary will give sympathetic consideration to this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Joint Under-Secretary will give serious consideration to this Amendment because it seems to me that there is an overlap here. It may not arise in Clause 1 of this Bill or Section 28 of the 1951 Act, both of which relate to trade and sewage effluent. I appreciate that trade effluent has been given a very wide interpretation in the interpretation Section of the 1951 Act. I would doubt if either of these two provisions would apply to the release of oil in navigable waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may in harbours, yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, Section 22 applies to this type of situation. I agree that this objection may be more academic than one of substance, because I cannot visualise proceedings being taken under this legislation for a situation which is covered by legislation specifically designed to cover it. One only needs to look, for example, at the penalty provisions of Section 6 of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955 to realise that the court has very much wider powers of sentence under that Act to deal with a situation for which, as I said, that legislation was specifically designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On summary conviction under the 1955 Act, the court has power to impose a fine of up to £1,000. These are very wide powers of sentence. I know of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
only one instance of similar powers of sentence, and that is highly special and is to be found only in specific statutory provisions. If it be the case, as my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) has very properly said, that it would not be intended to proceed under this legislation for that type of offence, it seems to me undesirable that one should have two pieces of legislation setting up two distinct offences arising out of the same facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can appreciate, as the Joint Under-Secretary will no doubt point out to me, that Section 24 of the 1955 Act specifically refers to other legislation bearing on this type of situation. None the less, I think that it is complicated to have two offences arising out of the same actions, albeit, of course, the Interpretation Act of 1889 provides that one cannot be punished twice for the same action. Accordingly, I express the hope that the Under-Secretary will consider this Amendment in some altered form. I do not think that Section 1 of the Act really bites in this situation, but Section 22 of the 1951 Act certainly does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of defences open to a charge under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955, it seems to me that the defences specified in Section 4(1) of that Act would not be available in any prosecution under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, although the special defences referred to in Section 4(2) of that Act would not really arise, because I do not think that the facts which the special defences envisaged would constitute an offence under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act in the first place. It may be an academic matter, but I think that it would be tidier if a short amendment could be allowed to explain the operation of this legislation to a situation already covered by the 1955 and 1963 Oil in Navigable Waters Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would only add that I understand that where orders have been made in England under the 1951 Act extending the provisions of that Act to tidal waters, provisos have been inserted extending the application of Section 22(1,a and 	<i>b</i>) from the corresponding provisions of Section 22(1,a and 	<i>b</i>) of the Scottish Act. The Secretary of State for Scot-
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
land refused to accede to a suggestion by the recorder in the inquiry in the Solway Order to do that—I think very properly, because if the Secretary of State were to insert a proviso of that nature into the Order he would be legislating. I think he took a very proper course. There is an opportunity, here and now, to correct this situation and it seems to me that it would be appropriate, in the circumstances, to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is a very fair contribution from the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), particularly in his closing remarks. What we are being invited to do, either in the form which the noble Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) suggested, or in any variant, which the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands suggested, is to depart from previous policy. It is perfectly right that the previous Secretary of State did not uphold the objection raised on the Solway Order, which the hon. Member referred to. He did not do so, either, in the case of the Forth. I cannot by any means divine what he intended in relation to the Clyde Order, to which objections were also made, but one would imagine, in view of what he had done before, and how this legislation, sponsored as it was, had been administered by the previous Administration, that it would be an invitation to the new Administration to depart from public policy as laid down by the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not responsible for what the party opposite do or how they change their minds. I do not know if this is an official Amendment or not; but, whether it is or not, it is a very serious matter, and one to which I have had to give a good deal of thought. Admittedly, the Amendment was only tabled a short while ago. I do not blame the hon. Member for that. It was obvious that at some stage or other this matter would have to be raised, because the shipping and docks interests—especially the docks interests—have been remarkably active in all the orders which have either been made or suggested on this particular point and have, therefore, made the process of getting these orders through a little longer and a little more difficult. I do not blame them for that; they have their own interests to defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
I am sorry that I must address myself to notes, but I want to give a thoughtful reply to this Amendment, so that it may be seen that the new Government, having reflected upon the actions of the old, in coming to the same conclusion have done so for very good reasons of public policy. This is all the more important, because there are distinct differences between Scottish and English legislation. As the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands, rightly pointed out, there is a different approach to the situation in Scotland compared with that in England, and I think that that is all to the good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the previous Secretary of State gave a very clear expression of policy when he refused to agree to the objections over the Forth and Solway Orders. It is true that Section 13 of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961, provides that nothing in this Act or in Section 7 of the 1951 Act, which is analagous to our Section 28 on new outlets and discharges, shall be taken as applying to the discharge of "effluent" from a ship or vessel. In Scotland we have not pursued that line on the view that we could not well control discharges of foul effluents from land and yet permit them from ships. Naturally, we have had the problems of shipping in mind. Representing, as I do, a port—I hope a growing port—on the Clyde, obviously I have an interest in this matter, and when I studied the question yesterday and today I came to conclusions with that interest uppermost in my mind, while at the same time trying to preserve the balance of public good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, we have had the problems of shipping in mind and have provided in Clause 13(3) of the Bill that nothing in the Bill or in any Order made under Section 29 of the 1951 Act shall be taken as applying to the ordinary use for the purposes of sanitation of sanitary appliances of vessels in tidal waters unless bye-laws, which would have to be confirmed by the Secretary of State, are made and enforced under powers in Section 25(1)	<i>(c)</i> of the 1951 Act, which enables authorities to make byelaws, for prohibiting or regulating the keeping or use, and so on, of vessels provided with sani-
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
tary appliances from which polluting matter passes or can pass into the stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North made the point that the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts give effect to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, and it is the case that the undertakings in the Convention are written into the Oil and Navigable Waters Acts which have heavier penalties than the 1951 Act. That was drawn to our attention by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands. The hon. Member also raised the point about special defences under Section 4 of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955, in respect of oil discharges
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of securing the safety of the vessel … or of saving life,"</p></blockquote>
or the other defence, that the escape of oil was
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consequence of damage to the vessel"</p></blockquote>
and that escape by leakage was
	<br><blockquote><p>"not due to any want of reasonable care"—</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to these defences, is that Parliament clearly intended that both the 1951 and the 1955 Acts should apply to polluting discharges and that before a discharge of oil could become an offence under the 1951 Act it would have to be proved that the person charged caused or knowingly permitted the polluting matter to enter tidal waters. As the hon. Gentleman said when referring to the possibility of a person being charged twice—and he was quite right to stress this point for the benefit of his hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North—it has to be borne in mind that under Section 33 of the Interpretation Act, 1889, a person cannot be charged twice for the same offence. This is an instance where the law makes life more reasonable in Scotland, because under our law a criminal prosecution must be by the Crown, and therefore the Crown must decide whether the evidence establishes a case for prosecution under the 1951 Act or the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other difficulties; perhaps they are not too serious. It depends very much on the viewpoint which is taken, but it does not follow that the areas covered in the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts are the same as those covered by our own Bill, or by tidal orders we may promote either in the immediate future
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
or in years to come. So there would be great difficulty for the river purification authorities in their immense task of trying to trace the origin of pollution which might come from a ship and be considered to be the subject of a prosecution under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act. Or an authority may not be sure whether the pollution comes from a ship or from an industrial plant on the upper or lower reaches of the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, and facing all the difficulties, I think that the policy propounded by the party opposite when in power, that there was adequate provision for the consideration of shipping and technical interests in the existing legislation, seems to us to be perfectly correct. I hope that the hon. Member will not press this matter because I should have to advise my hon. Friends to stand firm on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Joint Under-Secretary said that he hoped to be helpful and, to some extent, to advance on what the previous Government suggested. To my mind what he has said has not been helpful. Indeed, it may even add to the confusion. So far as I can see, the standards provided in the Bill and in the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts vary in two ways. There is, first, the question of defences available to offenders. We have removed the defence that there was no reasonable alternative but to discharge into a stream. Under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1963, Section 2(1) states that it is an offence to discharge oil into the sea, with the proviso
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it shall be a defence to prove that by reason of special circumstances it was impracticable or unreasonable to retain the oil or mixture in the ship."</p></blockquote>
This is precisely the provision in principle which the Minister has removed and it is confusing. When the various Orders are in force, a shipowner coming to the Clyde or the Forth will be faced with a problem. Will it be a defence that there was no alternative but to discharge the oil? It would seem that under the terms of the Bill it would be an offence but under the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts there is a defence. There is a clear distinction in black and white. Which is right and which is wrong?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were hoping that the Joint Under-Secretary would give an indication of which powers would be enforced and
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
which the Crown would accept. He put the case that it is up to the Crown to decide which provision will be enforced in a particular case. To me this seems unreasonable. Shipowners will be faced with a situation in which they will not know which legislation is to be applied. An action may be completely illegal under the terms of one Measure but it may be defensible under another. I think that the Joint Under-Secretary must go further and make clear which legislation the Crown will invoke in relation to the unavoidable pollution of the sea by oil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may come in on the last point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), the Joint Under-Secretary of State could not possibly answer it because the Government do not decide in terms under which legislation the Crown shall proceed in a prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I was trying to make was that there is a technical overlap, and technically it would be open to the Crown to proceed under either one or the other of two pieces of legislation. I have had five years experience as an Advocate depute in the Crown Office. I cannot visualise an Advocate depute proceeding in a matter of this nature other than under the legislation specifically designed to deal with it. I cannot foresee any likelihood of a prosecution of this type of offence under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Acts. That was why it seemed to me reasonable in the circumstances to take the positive step of excluding the operation of this legislation in respect of that type of offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that there are provisions and defences open under the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts which are not open under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Acts. Even if we have the circumstances narrated in Section 4(1) of the 1955 Act about securing the safety of the vessel, it would not be a defence to a charge under Section 2(1) where a person causes or knowingly permits pollution to enter a stream. Whatever reason there is, no defence is available under that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be frank about this. Even if there were a conviction under that legislation, no sentence would ever be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
imposed by any court. In the light of the circumstances as set out in Section 4(1) of the 1955 Act I cannot visualise a prosecution being brought. So, to some extent, this is all rather academic. I should not like it to be thought that I am pressing this Amendment on the Joint Under-Secretary. It seems to me one which might usefully be accepted. It would be tidier to accept it and to avoid this overlapping which cannot result in a conviction. I do not think the Crown authorities would proceed under the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said that this may well be academic. It is open to the Crown to choose under which piece of legislation a prosecution will be conducted. If the Crown decides to prosecute under the present legislation on a matter in respect of which it could prosecute under the provisions of the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts, it may be that the shipowner involved could be deprived of defences which have been internationally agreed; and to some extent we should be flouting our international agreements. I consider that a bad thing. I do not say that this is necessarily likely to happen. But it could happen, and the Amendment was designed to rule out that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Under-Secretary referred to the scope of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955, which is clearly comprehensive in that it states in Section 3(2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to the following waters, that is to say,—
	<ol>
	<li>the whole of the sea within the seaward limits of the territorial waters of the United Kingdom, and</li>
	<li>all other waters (including inland waters) which are within those limits and are navigable by sea-going ships."</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, it is not quite as simple as that. There is the problem which must apply in relation to those on the land who commit offences by discharging oil and who also could be prosecuted under the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts, as we have mentioned earlier. In this Bill we are dealing with the matter as a whole in relation to the river purification authorities, and so it follows that this problem is bound to arise when different Acts of Parliament, passed for different purposes, coincide. I am not saying that it is desirable. I am saying that it is difficult to avoid this without damaging the main intention of the Bill.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) seems to have changed his position substantially. The other day I was upbraided for not getting on with clearing up the Clyde. He and his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hill-head (Mr. Galbraith) attacked me for not covering the Clyde sufficiently. I accepted an Amendment which the hon. Member for Hillhead, acting not in collusion with, but independently of, but nevertheless concurrently with, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), pressed an Amendment about ships. However, the Government went even further and gave the Secretary of State more extensive power than that Amendment proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To accede to the noble Lord's Amendment would be to deal in the case of the Clyde only with the area of the Clyde Navigation Trust, the Lighthouse Trust and Greenock Harbour Trust. The map with which we have provided every hon. Member shows that that area is not all that extensive. To accept the Amendment would mean the loss of control over the discharge of oil which would otherwise be covered in the Bill as well as by other legislation. We feel that the objection to the limitation is important.

The Bill will not be administered unreasonably. Without going back to the absurd argument that purification authorities will be terribly bad and the Secretary of State half mad and reporters unfair at public inquiries, I cannot see how it can be argued that subsection (3) does not leave the position perfectly reasonable. We have not had a prosecution under the principal Act when the position was not dissimilar, certainly for the Forth and the Solway, although I do not say that we will not have prosecutions. I am not a lawyer and I cannot say whether advocates leading for the Crown will choose to proceed in this way, or under the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts. Although they proceeded under the latter before, it was not then the Government's intention to promote so many tidal waters orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reflected on this problem as long as we could and we have given it as much deliberation as we could. We believe that the acceptance of the Amendment would weaken the Bill more than the Bill as it stands would embarrass shipping and dock interests. We feel that those interests have nothing to fear; provided that they make every attempt to try to conform not only to the international convention as such, but to the intention of the Bill. There is little point in trying to clean rivers in their upper reaches and lecturing local authorities in the lower reaches about not discharging raw sewage and so on if we allow our estuaries to be fouled indiscriminately. I am glad to say that there are not many ships which do that, but there are some. To allow them to continue to foul the estuaries would obviate the whole purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with great regret that I have to say that we cannot meet the point of the Amendment. I have great sympathy with the shipping and dock interests whom the hon. Gentleman is championing, but on balance I think that they, as well as the public good, are served by not incorporating the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

what he was saying. However, those of us who have had correspondence from coastal towns over many years and who are aware of the importance of oil pollution of our shores have to recognise that if the Amendment were accepted, there would be a great danger that we would get even more pollution. Bathing facilities on the Ayrshire coasts are damaged by oil deposits and contamination. All Scottish coastal resorts agree that the dumping of oil and the clearing out of tanks, which regularly occurs against the law and which cannot be traced, causes great destruction. Many learned societies agree that we should prosecute to the full extent of the law. A substantial body of opinion would be disappointed if the law were weakened.

It would be simple to deal with waters already covered by the Oil in Navigable Waters legislation while other tidal waters, marked red on the map, would, we hope, be covered by the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be observed that this is the last Amendment standing in my name, but I believe it to be important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1951 Act provides that it is an offence for any person to deposit on any land solid refuse from any mine or quarry so that it falls or is carried into a stream. Various local authorities have made representations to me on the subject and it seems to me that the provision is too narrow in that while it prohibits any refuse from any mine or quarry being dumped into a stream, it does not deal with the dumping of other refuse into a stream or in the neighbourhood of a stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two serious sets of circumstances can arise. I have experienced the first, which is when a person dumps rubbish, such as boiler ash, on the banks of the stream. He may have been given planning permission, but his dump may have become full and he may not want to start another. He does not dump the boiler ash into the stream, but dumps it conveniently so that when there is an occasional flood, the ash is carried away. This is very helpful to the person concerned, but very disadvantageous to lower proprietors where serious accumulations of debris may fall on the banks of the stream. A good deal of trouble has been caused and I know of no statutory provision to prevent it, although it happens very frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect is equally important to those of us who are lovers of the countryside. This principally happens in the countryside where proprietors and others dump refuse on the banks of streams. I have seen this happen frequently in the most beautiful parts of our countryside, where a proprietor thoughtlessly dumps household refuse on his own land on the banks of a stream. He may not object to a nuisance of that
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
sort on his own land, although it is unsightly, but it is a great hardship to the lower proprietors and, indeed, to the general public who enjoy the lower stretches of the stream to find all sorts of refuse coming down, not only pots and pans, but household ashes. I have actually seen old furniture and mattresses carried downstream and causing serious nuisance. I commend the new Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although no local authorities have made representations to the Government about this matter, that does not mean that I do not regard the point as an important one. It is. Certainly, when one sees all the rubbish and refuse that occurs in streams, it is a matter of great concern to many of us that this should be permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question arises, however, whether this is the right kind of Bill in which to deal with the matter. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has ingeniously, in the new Clause, deleted the reference to mines and quarries and has brought in "any" refuse as the application. The fact that the earlier reference was to mines and quarries is irrelevant, because that was designed to meet a point that was raised during the discussions preceding the 1951 Act and one which was reserved because of the particular difficulties concerning a person depositing solid refuse from a mine or quarry where the consent of the river purification authority could be obtained, where there was no alternative and where a person was exempt from penalty in consequence of taking those steps and pointing out that there were difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To extend the scope of Section 22 of the principal Act as the new Clause suggests—and this is a reflection on an earlier attempt by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West to achieve the same object by another Amendment—would make the administration rather difficult. Local authorities already have power to make byelaws concerning a lot of refuse of this kind. For example, this refuse could be alleged to be a potential cause of flooding in respect of other than agricultural land. In that case the nuisance can be controlled by byelaws under Section 6 of the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act, 1961. There is also the Litter Act, 1958, which unfortunately, has not been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
employed to the full. It is a reflection not only on the Government but upon ordinary citizens and the police, that the provisions of that Act are not employed as conscientiously as the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Speir) intended when he introduced his Bill in 1957–58. I hope that local authorities will look more closely at the problem presented to them by this matter and use their powers and ensure that the provisions of the Litter Act are used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, but it would not be right to incorporate this provision in the Bill. It would impose upon river purification authorities a duty which—"extraneous" is too strong a word—is not directly related to the problem which they are enjoined to tackle. The strain on river boards and authorities in the next five or 10 years will be considerable if they do their job, as I hope they will, conscientiously and well. I should not like to impose upon them another job which should be carried out by other persons. Therefore, I counsel the Committee not to accept the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was with regret that I heard the reply of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on this important matter. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) was quite correct in saying that in many ways pollution of a river is caused when debris from factories or households is dumped on river banks and ultimately pollutes the river. Surely, this is a matter which should fall within the ambit of river purification boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us know of examples of this kind of nuisance. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has indicated that there is need for greater power but states that whether it should be dealt with under the Bill is questionable. He has drawn attention to the fact that local authorities may introduce byelaws and take action under the Litter Act. Nevertheless, such bye-laws have never been put into operation, measures have never been taken under the Litter Act and beautiful rivers have been desecrated by the dumping of rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am mindful of a stretch of river in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence), adjacent to my own, where the beautiful river Kelvin passes along by
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
Inch Bella, a name which means "beautiful bridge"; but it is not a beautiful bridge now because of the considerable dumping of rubbish along the Kelvin bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend to give a little more consideration to the important point raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West. The Clause would put no onerous burden upon river boards but would strengthen their arm to do what we all so much desire in keeping our rivers clean and beautiful if that is within the bounds of possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that eloquent plea, I am prepared to look at the matter again, although the arguments with which I have been provided are quite strong in the opposite direction. We would have great difficulty with the question of dumping because the new Clause would mean that to tip refuse, even refuse for land reclamation, would become an offence. There are certain legitimate activities of industry which must go on, which involve laying down solid material at the side of river banks, and which might come within the definition of the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) would consider me unfair if I relied upon the reason that his new Clause must be perfect in wording. Nevertheless, there are difficulties in devising a form of words which would cover everything. While I make no commitment other than to think about the matter again, I hope that the hon. Member will be willing to withdraw his new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) will withdraw the new Clause, but I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will consider it again. The position concerning pollution can be worsened by what is excluded under Section 22(1,	<i>c</i>) of the main Act, which would be altered by the new Clause. What is dealt with in that Section is solid refuse from a mine or quarry. Whilst that could, if undertaken in the event of dumping to any great extent, cause damming and flooding, I think also of cases where lighter refuse is deposited and pollutes streams. That is not covered by the legislation and the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West would allow it to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
I hope that in reviewing the position my hon. Friend will be mindful of the polluting influence of the dumping into lesser streams of lighter refuse, in some cases household refuse, when the effluent and drainage from it is carried into tributaries and main streams and causes nuisance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for agreeing to think about the matter again. I ask him when doing so to take two things into account. One is the question of byelaws. These have only local effect, but the problem applies to the whole of Scotland and is a matter rather for legislation than bye-laws. Apart from that, it is a major undertaking for local authorities to make byelaws, which must be confirmed by the Secretary of State and all that sort of thing. General legislation would be much more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the Under-Secretary's suggestion that more work would be imposed upon river boards. I suggest that he is mistaken. Prosecutions would probably start, not with river boards, but with the authorities concerned with criminal matters in the ordinary way. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I can think of other times and circumstances when this would have provided "meat and drink" for some of my hon. Friends. I think I am right in saying that the second syllable of this name should have a double vowel "a" and not the double "r".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a small point, this is, nevertheless, an important matter when legal arguments arise, particularly when we have had gentlemen entertaining us in Scotland singing about Campbeltown Loch being turned to whisky. This could have an important bearing on legal arguments for the future about Excise duty. I think I am correct in saying that the spelling should be Davaar. The gazetteer to which I have referred certainly offers two other alternatives. It can be spelt Davar or with an "e" as the first vowel, but not as it appears in the Bill.

This is no reflection on my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, because the Opposition have been anxious to let the world know that this is their Bill.
