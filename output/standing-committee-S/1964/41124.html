	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's Sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Willis.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Bill has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
In the ancient Burgh of Musselburgh, which I have the privilege of representing in the House of Commons, older men like to talk nostalgically of the salmon they used to catch in the River Esk. The story goes around of how the last salmon rather foolishly entered the river and made its way painfully up to the Telford Bridge and finally, in disgust at what it met in the river, gave itself up to a boy with a bent pin just before it got to the old Roman Bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that similar stories are told about other rivers all over Scotland. This is part of the folklore of Scotland which has grown up as a result of the increasing extent to which poisonous and polluting matter has been poured into our rivers and estuaries during the past few years. Certainly many of what were once fast flowing, sparkling streams and rivers have become little more than smelly, dirty water channels, and yet in Scotland we are fortunate in that we still possess a great heritage of inland and tidal waters which are virtually as nature made them. It is our job to keep them so and to try to rid the others of the pollution from which they suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first general attempt to do this was made by the Labour Government, I am glad to say, in the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951. In that Act, a duty was placed on the Secre-

tary of State for Scotland to promote the cleanliness of the rivers and other inland waters and tidal waters of Scotland. It required him to appoint a Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee and it empowered him to appoint river purification boards. Under the Act, nine such boards have been established. There have also been set up river purification authorities which, north and west of the Caledonian Canal, consist of the county councils and the large burghs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act gave a certain number of powers to the boards and authorities, but its main powers were contained in Sections 22 and 28. In Section 22, the use of streams for disposing of polluting matter was prohibited. Under Section 28, the consent of the boards had to be obtained when any new or altered outlet for the discharge of trade or sewage effluent was made into a stream. It is mainly these powers which have enabled the boards and the authorities to do the work which they have done since they were set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 29 of that Act authorised the Secretary of State to apply the provisions of the Act to tidal waters if an application for an order was made by a river purification authority or other interested person, and the Secretary of State was also required to make orders for the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde as from the appointed day. The order in respect of the Firth of Forth came into operation on 1st August, 1960. A draft order in respect of the Clyde was published in January, 1962. A public inquiry into the objections to that order was held in September, 1963, and the report of the inquiry was received last July. So far, nothing further has been done about that order. An order has also been made in respect of the Solway Firth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general result of the operation of the Act, there has been some overall improvement in the condition of Scottish rivers, but the pattern is varied. In some rivers the improvement has been notable. In others, the improvement has been barely noticeable, while in yet others there has been a deterioration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This picture may be a little disappointing, but it is true to say that, but for the work of the Advisory Committee and the boards and authorities, it would have been a great deal worse.

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I am sure that the whole Committee would wish me to express our appreciation of the work done by the boards and of the manner in which it has been done. I mention the manner because, by and large, the results achieved have come about through the co-operation of the boards and authorities with local authorities, industry and agriculture rather than by resort to the penal provisions of the 1951 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend tell us of the rivers where improvement has been shown and those where no improvement has been shown so far?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give my hon. Friend a detailed list, but I am sure that he can call some to mind himself. I know that the River Esk in my own division, while not all that it should be, has nevertheless been considerably improved. That is one example from my constituency and I am sure that other hon. Members can apply what I have said to the rivers in their constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of what has been done and as a result of what has been done, it has become evident that the boards and the authorities require to have their powers extended, and the Bill seeks to do that. The 1951 Act applied the full system of control of polluting discharges by a consent procedure to new or altered discharges after the application of the Act to particular areas. It was an offence under Section 22 to make any discharge of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter into a stream, but a defence was provided if proof were given that there was no reasonable alternative to discharge into a stream and that all reasonably practicable steps were being taken to prevent the matter from being unnecessarily poisonous or polluting. In this the legislation for Scotland was broadly similar to that enacted for England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience has shown that there would be an advantage in extending the consent procedure to discharges which existed prior to the application of the 1951 Act. This extension of control has been enacted for England and Wales. The Advisory Committee has been urging that similar provisions should be made for Scotland at the earliest possible opportunity, and in this it has had
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the support of many river purification authorities. The Advisory Committee includes representatives not only of the local authorities, but of industry, agriculture and fisheries, and there has been general agreement on the principle of bringing pre-1951 Act discharges under control by a consent procedure on the lines of the English and Welsh legislation of 1961.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 of the Bill applies the consent procedure and powers to pre-1951 Act discharges. Under the Bill, it would be an offence to contravene these requirements and the maximum fine would be £500. This represents an increase over the penalties of the 1951 Act, but the increase mainly reflects the changed value of money and makes the maximum fine rather more realistic in today's terms. I emphasise that we expect that it will still be the aim of river purification authorities wherever possible to enlist the effective co-operation of those who are responsible for the discharges. As in the 1951 Act, it is intended to allow a reasonable period before bringing fully into force this important extension of control, and Clause 1(11) provides that this period shall not be less than 14 months after the enactment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend elaborate a little about how the Clause may affect industries such as the paper industry which is very important to Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The paper industry will have to obtain consent for its pre-1951 discharges of effluent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the difficulty about the paper industry even asking for permission to put the effluent into the river is that there are no known means whereby water used by the industry can be economically purified, so that the industry will be in some difficulty about meeting the requirements of the Bill. The Bill may have a crippling effect on the industry and I should like my hon. Friend to devote a few minutes of his speech to that aspect of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expect to say something about it, but the answer is that the river purification authority will take those factors into consideration when giving consent. All these factors can be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
considered and the result of the consideration will form part of the terms of the consent. If an industry is not satisfied, it will have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, as in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 provides that applicants for the consent of the river purification authority should have freedom against prosecution in respect of discharges while their applications are being dealt with in the circumstances envisaged by Clause 1(11) where applications are made before the appointed day for bringing Clause 1 into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 ensures that river purification authorities will have the proper information needed by them in considering applications for consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 is the corollary of widening the scope of control by a consent procedure, and it provides that those discharges that are made in accordance with consents and the conditions attached to consents under this Bill or the 1951 Act shall not constitute offences against other statutes dealing with pollution. These are specified in subsection (2) of Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 25 (1,	<i>a</i>) of the principal Act, which is repealed by this Clause, provided for byelaws being made by river purification authorities prescribing standards for the purpose of determining when matter is to be treated as poisonous, noxious or polluting. Circumstances and conditions, however, are so varied that it has been found both in Scotland and in England and Wales that it is technically impracticable to prescribe such standards for general application. This means, in fact, that the river purification authorities have to deal with each particular case on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 is intended to provide a reasonable basis for the effective operation of the consent procedure. It is important that someone who is complying with the terms of a consent should have the assurance that these terms will not be varied at short notice without his agreement. After all, the conditions imposed by a river purification authority may have entailed modifications of plant to produce an effluent of suitable standard. But it is equally important that river purification authorities should be able to put the position under review in the light of changing conditions in
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the waters for which they are responsible. The period set down in the Clause is not less than two years, which seems to be fair to all concerned and leaves a suitable discretion to river purification authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 provides for appeals to the Secretary of State—and I think this is point in which my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) was interested—on lines similar to those of the Spray Irrigation (Scotland) Act, 1964. These provisions take into account the considerations that have governed the attitude of the Scottish Committee of the Council on Tribunals. These apply particularly in the requirement—which actually is in Clause (1)4—that where the river purification authority refuses consent, or grants consent subject to conditions, it shall communicate in writing to the applicant its decision and the reasons therefor; and also in the requirement that the Secretary of State shall afford a hearing to the parties concerned in an appeal. The appeal provisions will also apply to appeals under the principal Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but this is a most important matter for many in the paper industry in Scotland. If, perchance, the decision of the purification authority was of such a nature that it necessitated an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland, would the Secretary of State for Scotland have power, after listening to the appeal, to vary the contents of the Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Bill provides a time factor. The answer to my hon.

at this stage, we allowed the Minister to make his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Steele, I would express some resentment at the idea that I had forgotten the content of my question. It has always been permissible in this Committee for an objection to be made, and I do not think that the rules of procedure have been altered in that respect. In view of the contents of my question, if the answer is "Yes", it means that the Secretary of State could vary the contents of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this point it is all right as long as the Minister gives way, but there is difficulty when we get interjections into interjections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question just asked is that the Secretary of State does not vary the provisions of the Act. I apologise to my hon. Friend if I offended him, but when I said "Yes", he looked rather thoughtful and puzzled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, because it was a contradiction of terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Provision is also made in the Bill for the Secretary of State, if he desires, or if so directed by the Court of Session, to state a case for the opinion of that court on any question of law arising in the appeal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 brings into line with this Bill the relevant provisions of Section 28 of the principal Act governing new or altered discharges, particularly in regard to the maximum fines which the Bill establishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 relates to tidal waters, and I should say here that the recommendation of the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee in regard to wider powers also covered the position of control of tidal waters. In the case of England and Wales, the Clean Rivers (Estuaries and Tidal Waters) Act, 1960 applied the consent procedure to new or altered discharges to the tidal waters specified in the Schedule to that Act as they applied already to inland waters under the England and Wales Act of 1951. In the case of Scottish tidal waters, Section 29 of the 1951 Act made provision for control of such waters by Order, with special provision for the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
such control being limited to new or altered discharges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(2) will apply control over new or altered discharges to all those tidal waters, as mentioned in the Third Schedule, in which development leading to any significant change in their present condition is thought to be likely. This is on a similar footing to the provisions for England and Wales. This provision will obviate the need for river purification authorities or other interested persons to apply for individual tidal waters Orders for the purpose of controlling new or altered discharges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tidal waters Orders, however, have already been made under Section 29 of the Principal Act in respect of the Firth of Forth and the Solway Firth, and subsection (1) of the Clause provides that, in those two cases, the control shall also extend to existing discharges, as it does under Clauses 1 to 3 to inland waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 brings the maximum fines for offences under Section 22 of the principal Act into line with those now imposed under the Bill. The Clause also repeals Section 22(3) of the principal Act, under which it is a defence to charge under subsection (1,	<i>a</i>) of that Section to show that it was not reasonably practicable to dispose of the effluent in any other way. This is no longer necessary, because questions of practicability will be considered in relation to the application for consent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens to industrial concerns that have hitherto put effluents into a river and are now to be controlled by Clauses 8 and 9? They may thereby be put to a great deal of expense—and, indeed, industrial loss—by being debarred from discharging effluents which, hitherto, they have discharged, and the discharge of which is necessary for the purposes of their industrial concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a question similar to that asked by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire, and the answer is exactly the same. If the discharge existed before 1951, the concerns will now have to obtain consent for that discharge. In obtaining that consent, discussions will take place, and arrangements will be made, where possible, to try to meet the difficulties that may result. I take it that, as a result of the discussions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
that take place, suitable arrangements will be found possible in most cases. If not, and if the person affected feels that he has just cause to complain, he will have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 is rather lengthy in its treatment of the subject of taking samples of effluents, but it is vital in the interests of all concerned that there should be a clear code governing the taking of samples. As subsection (1) provides, these samples will be presumed, until the contrary is shown in any legal proceedings, to be samples of what is passing to the controlled waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 11 restricts the disclosure of information acquired for the purposes of the Bill, and is designed to safeguard the interests of persons who are providing information and samples of effluent to the river purification authorities. A sample of effluent could well give a great deal of valuable information about technical processes that have been developed by a firm. However, there is nothing in the Clause which would in any way inhibit the proper exercise of the functions of the purification authorites nor, of course, of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 is a straightforward means of ensuring that certain specific powers and provisions of the 1951 Act will be available in the application and enforcement of the further control provided under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 is formal, apart from the provision of subsection (2), which reflects a small divergence of Scottish practice from that of England and Wales in regard to discharges from ships. We do not consider that the general exemption for discharges from ships allowed by the English Act should also be applied to Scottish waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 relates to expenses and is in standard form, and Clause 15 is purely formal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill may seem rather technical, but because its purpose is to retain or recover some part of our national heritage—clean and sparkling rivers and estuaries—I am sure that it will command the warm support of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will allow me, Mr. Steele, to be, perhaps, technically out of order in congratulating you on this, the first occa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
sion of your taking the Chair in this Committee. As you have sat in the Committee for many years, you will know the hazards and advantages of being in the Chair. I am sure that both sides wish you well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to take this first opportunity to wish the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) well on his appointment as Minister of State. Many of us in the Committee will have difficulty, as I had when he was speaking, in remembering a single occasion in the last five or six years when he spoke at such length—though I do not criticise the length of his speech—without once saying that something was quite scandalous. I am sure that, once he finds his feet, his old rumbustious self will burst forth from the brief to which he was obviously somewhat tied this morning. I know that it will also be a comfort to many of us on this side to be able to ask him for legal interpretations of some of the more obscure points in legal draftsmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak purely personally when I say that I regret the absence today of the Secretary of State. I was hoping that this would be an occasion on which I could, for the first time, publicly congratulate him on taking over his very great task. I appreciate, however, that in spite of the fact that he often required and requested my presence in the Committee at a time when some of his colleagues were introducing Measures and policies not, perhaps, immediately and obviously of benefit to industry in Scotland, he has more important affairs elsewhere, so this occasion must wait.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think hon. Members on both sides of the Committee realise that in Scotland we have one extremely important natural resource in water, perhaps to a greater extent than other parts of the United Kingdom. I think we also realise that this Bill is moving part of the way along a road that it is necessary to travel for the preservation of what we have and the improvement of what perhaps our ancestors spoiled. We also hope that this is only the first of a number of Measures which the Government of the day will bring in to make certain that our water resources are properly used for all the purposes for which we need them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I join most sincerely with the Minister of State in his tribute to regional water boards for what they have been able to achieve over the last 13 or 14 years, and particularly to General Sir Philip Christison, who has taken a very active part in a way which the hon. Member will understand only too well in stimulating the boards to carry out their duties in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point on which I find myself in some doubt and perhaps before the Committee stage of the Bill we can have some more information about it. I refer to the actual areas to be covered by the legislation we are considering. I have studied the Schedule concerned, but it is a little difficult, without detailed knowledge of each part of the coast of Scotland, to know where these various river authorities operate. In opening the debate the hon. Gentleman mentioned that there were nine river boards. It would be of advantage to all hon. Members if, before the Committee stage, we were given fairly detailed ideas of where and how particular boards operate. Perhaps a suitable map could be provided to save us searching for other information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the increase in the powers taken by this Bill over tidal areas. I am not certain whether he agrees or not, but I understand that the 1951 Act gave powers only to control effluents in the Forth and the Clyde. As I understand this Bill, the Secretary of State will now take powers to control other areas. One point on which I am not clear is why, in taking those powers, the Secretary of State wishes only to take them to cover new effluents in tidal waters and not powers to control effluents which existed before 1951. There may be good reasons for that; if there are, I am sure that we shall hear them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next general point I make on the Bill is on the question of cost. I appreciate very much what has been said about the success achieved under previous legislation through the willing co-operation of industrialists, farmers and others who are affected, but if this Measure is to achieve what we in this Committee still want to see achieved, I find it a little difficult to be certain that we can achieve it when the estimate of costs falling on the Secretary of State is so
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
low as £1,000 a year and the estimate of costs for the local authorities is in the region of £25,000 a year. To be effective I think a great deal of money will have to be spent. It is important that we should be told who, in fact, will be spending the money, and given any estimate which the Government have been able to make through their contacts with various people on the sort of amounts which will be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When thinking of the cost we have also inevitably to wonder about the time scale for these operations and the number of applications that will come in when we consider all trade and other effluents dating from before 1951, which may be very large indeed. I have heard in some areas estimates as high as several thousand just for one area. It will be difficult for the Scottish Office, enthusiastic and hard-working though I know it to be, to deal with the vast number of applications and perhaps appeals arising from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that under Clause 1 there is to be a time delay of 14 months and under Clause 15 the Bill is to come into force two months after the Bill is passed. I ask the Government to look at these timings because we need to get the Act working efficiently and we may lose some of the willing co-operation of the many people who may be affected if we do not give them a reasonable time to state their cases and see what it will cost them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members want to speak on the Bill in principle. It is one which the Committee can safely welcome. I am certain that, in the manner of the Scottish Standing Committee, we shall be able to make some improvements in Committee. That is the time when the Bill should be most carefully considered. I certainly welcome it, and hope it will have a speedy passage through its various stages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also should like to congratulate you, Mr. Steele, on your new post as Chairman of this Committee. It also falls to me to congratulate two hon. Members on "maiden speeches"—the Minister of State on a maiden speech from the Government Front Bench and the former Secretary of State for Scotland on a maiden speech as leader of the Opposition in this Committee. We heard very little from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
him before he became Secretary of State for Scotland. We welcome the courteous and friendly way in which he welcomed the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather sorry that my hon. Friend the Minister of State did not take the opportunity of giving us some information about progress made under previous Acts. I represent the area of the tidal waters of the Forth, which suffered very much from pollution. Although some little progress has been made, pollution is still a very great problem there, one which seems almost insoluble. On a still, quiet day the river becomes covered with a phlegm of different effluents and the oxygen simply disappears from the river. Then salmon have to flounder in the low reaches and cannot get up the river. I should like to have heard of progress being made scientifically in finding methods of making it possible for salmon and other fish to get up rivers. I am told that even a wind breaking the surface of the river and getting oxygen into it immediately sets the fish free so that they can go walloping up the river relieved of the poisonous substance which shuts the oxygen out of the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of research has been made chemically and scientifically into ways of relieving this problem other than by merely stopping effluent. In some cases it is very difficult to prove that effluent actually damages fish because it has been demonstrated that in a great many cases the effluent itself is counteracted and neutralised by other forces in due course. The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) is the one which principally offends my constituency in this regard. Effluent from Stirling paper mills eventually reaches my constituency as it goes down the Forth. I cannot have any great optimism about this Bill because my experience shows the terrible problem economically of doing anything to stop effluents from paper mills and collieries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Coal Board is one of the worst offenders, and now that poisonous substances are put on to the land to destroy insects, those substances find their way into rivers and it is difficult to know how to stop this. I have been thinking that in future we ought to station paper mills on top of obsolete Lanark-
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
shire collieries and let them discharge their effluent into the enormous mines which are now empty and which could carry that discharge for many years. I hope that when the Under-Secretary replies to the debate he will give us some information about what progress has been made in this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think anyone expects miracles from this Bill because it only gives permission for other steps to be taken in the direction already taken by former Acts of Parliament. The money problem is not one for the Government. No Government can pass legislation which compels industries to ruin themselves—and many would be ruined if they were compelled to stop discharging these effluents. One cannot stop the habits and customs of 100 years in a matter of months. Something has to be done, either scientifically to neutralise these elements or more in accordance with the economics of the situation, to have them stopped. The industries are very important to Scotland and it would be quite impossible to say that they are not to be there because of the effluent they cause. If it came to a question of sacrifice of fish or industry, I am afraid we should have to sacrifice the fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend not consider that when a new factory is proposed to be established in a given area the problems to which my right hon. Friend has referred should be taken into consideration? The siting of the factory should not be close to a sewage, works which already is grossly overloaded or too far removed from the general sewerage system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the future is assured in this direction and that consent must be obtained before such a factory can be established. Consent would not be given except in the most important cases. Some other method would have to be found to deal with the problem. Our problem does not concern the future, but the past. We cannot get rid of the past so easily, as the Bill and experience of former Acts have shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we have some information about the application of this Bill to other waters? For instance, Dounreay comes into the kind of situation about which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) has spoken. I take it that in further works
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
which involve the discharge of atomic energy effluent, perhaps of radioactive elements, provision will be made to deal with this aspect. I take it that provision will be made for any industry of this kind to see that its discharge will not be permanently offensive or dangerous to public health. I understand that discharges from radioactive institutions of this kind can accumulate and gather for years. Unless a way can be found of getting permanently rid of them, such as in old pits or the like, they may become a danger. I should, therefore, like to hear whether the waters into which Dounreay discharges its effluent and any future developments of this kind will be covered. This is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I welcome the Bill. I hope that we shall get an indication of further progress concerning rivers like the Forth, which is still a good salmon river, which might be endangered and damaged for ever if the position were to get worse. I should also like to know whether any investigation has been made into alternative methods of making it possible for fish to go up river, such as in the still and quiet days, by stirring up the river by artificial means to break up the effluent and to prevent the covering which would completely block out the oxygen from the water. Are there any artificial methods of providing oxygen for the rivers? If this could be done in the upper reaches, presumably the oxygen would be carried down automatically by the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are interesting problems if we can find solutions to them and I should like to know from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State what progress has been made. This is such a terrific problem that we cannot expect early results. It would give us encouragement to find that there were alternative methods of dealing with the problem apart from waiting until these enormous industries can alter their method of discharging effluent into rivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank you, Mr. Steele, for giving me the opportunity on this my first appearance on the Scottish Grand Committee to speak so early in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
It is right that I should declare my interest in the Bill since I have seen at first hand the operation of the 1951 Act and I have had experience of how legislation of this kind works. I am particularly interested from the agricultural viewpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I appreciate the need which exists to clean up our rivers, we should also be very much aware of the far-reaching effects of the Bill. Until now, it is in general only those farms which have increased or altered their discharge of effluent which have been affected by river purification regulations. Under the Bill, however, thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of farms will come within the scope of the purification regulations. Because effluent has been discharged from many of these farms over generations, many of the farmers are quite unaware of the implications of the Bill and what it will mean for them. Moreover, if the Bill is to be effective, it will tax seriously the resources of the river boards as they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to appreciate that in discussing farm effluents in the same way as has been mentioned in relation to effluents from the paper industry, there is no staightforward or simple answer about how to deal with the problem. Technical knowledge of the treatment of farm effluent is still very much at the stage of development and different authorities are by no means agreed on the best method of dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, it is not at all easy for a farmer in a remote area far away from existing sewage systems to connect with the public sewer. If he is to install some form of treatment plant, its expense is likely to be prohibitive. This means that he is left with the alternative of spraying his effluent on to his fields or adopting some other system, such as the new American system of lagoons which is now under discussion. Even these last two alternatives do not necessarily give an effective answer, because the success of the operation of any of these systems of dealing with farm sewage depends upon many factors outwith the control of an individual farmer, such as the type of soil on which his farm is situated, climatic conditions and the type of cropping programme for which the farm is suited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Whilst there is, obviously, no single or simple answer to the problem of effluent disposal from farms, whatever kind of treatment is adopted will involve a high degree of expense. I know this from experience. Not only will it involve enormous expense for individual farmers, but it will take a great deal of time to plan and carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, therefore, like the Secretary of State to consider three things. First, what technical assistance is he prepared to provide for farmers to advise them on the solution of this problem? Secondly, is he prepared to offer any special financial assistance outwith the existing assistance, either to the local authorities or through the Department of Agriculture, to help farmers in meeting this problem? Thirdly, I should like to ask that the period allowed for those who discharge effluent to improve the quality of the effluent should be increased, because I do not consider that the provision under the Bill is adequate for action to be taken. If these points could be met, it would go a considerable way towards making it easier for farmers to meet the requirements of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join my hon. Friends in congratulating you, Mr. Steele, on your appointment to the Chair. I also extend my congratulations to my hon. Friends who now occupy the Front Bench and to the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) on his maiden speech in the Scottish Grand Committee. The hon. Member spoke very well and obviously knows a great deal about farms and farming and, no doubt, we will hear from him again in the Committee. We all look forward to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There, however, my congratulations must cease. I certainly cannot join my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) in congratulating either the river boards or anyone else upon the work that has been done in cleaning up the Scottish rivers. In the Clyde Valley, the rivers are still a national disgrace. Any improvement that there has been is certainly not visible to the eye, neither is one conscious of an improvement by the nose. Indeed, by the time the river
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
gets to Glasgow, it is little better than an open sewer. Let us call spades spades. These are the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts are also that industry, in the Clyde Valley at least, is and has been antisocial in its behaviour and outlook and quite irresponsible in the things that it does. I had experience of trying to clean up the rivers around Mother-well and Wishaw. I remember going to a large section of industry and complaining about the effluent that it was putting into the River Calder. The industry had settling tanks but had forgotten to clean them out for five years. Consequently, the effluent merely flowed out. It is not a question of lack of means. It is rather a lack of will to comply with the spirit of the Act. The river boards have no teeth. All they can do is to try to persuade industry to do the right thing. Industry is always able to convince the river boards that everything possible is being done, but we know that that is not the fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities, too, are guilty. I know of one local authority which spent a tremendous amount of money in building an up-to-date sewage plant. From one end it produces clean effluent which, the sewage manager swears, can be drunk, although I have never tried it. This brand new sewage works does a wonderful job. At the other end, however, the dirt and muck are pumped into the river just 300 yards further down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that unless the river boards have real powers, we will never be able to do this job. It is more than 10 years since the principal Act was introduced. At that time, those of us who were members of local authorities were trying our little best under common law to clean up the rivers for which we had responsibility, but common law, the only power available to us, was difficult to operate. One could only claim rights as riparian owner and ask that the person further up the river should pass on the river in as good a state as he got it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What argument was that, however, when, right at the beginning of the River Calder, the National Coal Board, without making any effort to clean or to do anything about its effluent, was pumping it into the river, affecting the whole course of the river until it met the Clyde? At Garrion Bridge on the Clyde, the waters are fairly clean and there are trout,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
but in the stretch from there to the Hamilton Road bridge over the Clyde, effluent for which local authorities are responsible is being pumped in without any effort to clean it or do anything about it. We are only playing at the problem if we do not recognise these facts. River boards have had 10 years to get something done, but nothing has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I heard someone in Paisley say that the salmon were running up the Cart. I believe that if they had legs, they could have run up the Cart. That is about the only way they could have got up it. In fact, during the recent election I had the misfortune to have a committee room above the Cart. When leaning out of a certain window, one got an appreciation of the kind of sewer that the Cart really is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do not let us fool about with this problem. The Bill, I am sorry to say, will not do what is required to be done. Industry would not ruin itself by putting in two or three settling tanks. Can anyone who has flown into Renfrew Airport over the north of Glasgow and looked down at the River Kelvin as it passes two factories tell me that what is happening on that river could not be prevented? I do not believe it. It is a question not of technical or scientific "know-how", but of will. We will never clean up our rivers or cure this national disgrace until we give river authorities real power to prevent it and until we insist that industry accepts its social responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was most refreshing to hear the knowledgeable and highly sensible contribution from my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome my hon. Friend's contribution to our deliberations in Room 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also found the contribution of the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) refreshing. It was certainly forthright. I was only sorry to hear him having to describe the Clyde as little better than an open sewer. I remember being told by some of my friends who know a bit about London and this area that before the Thames water reaches the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
sea, every drop of it is used three times. When you next brush your teeth, Mr. Steele, it is worth bearing that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not too sure that I would willingly take a swig out of the Tweed at Berwick where it reaches the sea. I certainly would not do that in the Clyde. I was for a short time on the Tweed River Purification Board when I was a member of Roxburgh County Council. As a result, I learned that there was a real need for the legislation which is being introduced today. I therefore welcome it whole-heartedly. Some people suggest that this legislation is grossly overdue and that we should have produced it some time ago. That may well be so but, on the other hand, there are possibly some advantages in delay. The first is that by having time to study how the previous legislation has worked, we are in a better position to produce more sensible and more comprehensive legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example of this is the way in which three years ago the English went ahead with passing legislation such as we are aiming to produce now. As a result, we are now able to produce more comprehensive legislation. I understand that the present Bill more or less embodies the guts of two English Measures, the Clean Rivers (Estuaries and Tidal Waters) Act, 1960 and the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961. We are producing rather tidier legislation as a result. We have learned from the mistakes and pitfalls into which the English have fallen. This will be valuable in the implementation of the future Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another advantage in delay is that everybody in Scotland has seen that this Bill was on the way. As soon as legislation was passed in England it was clear that it would come to us as well, sooner or later. Time to think about it has been very valuable when so much stress must be laid on the importance of cooperation in the implementation of the Measure. I was pleased to hear the Minister of State acknowledging that cooperation must play an important part in future. My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) spoke about the time when the Bill should become effective. It is a matter for serious deliberation. We want to avoid the danger of pushing it too fast for people to be able to react to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Early in October the Institute of Sewage Purification published a useful summary of past legislation on the pollution of rivers and water generally. It was sent to Members of Parliament, among others, but this was at a time when there were no Members of Parliament. It was during the election campaign. I suspect that some hon. Members may then have had their minds rather heavily occupied with the more mud-slinging aspects of party campaigning and that purification was not necessarily the first thing in their thoughts. This is a valuable document which deserves serious study. It draws attention to the fact that the legislation which we are now considering must be regarded as merely a part of a whole series of pieces of legislation dealing with all aspects of problems of water, rivers, abstraction, resources, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I do not stray out of order if I seek an assurance from the Under-Secretary of State who is to reply to the debate that the Government and the Scottish Office are giving serious consideration to all these other aspects relating to water, because they are all closely inter-related with the problems which we are discussing in connection with this Bill. There are, for example, certain aspects of trade waste and effluent not covered by the Bill. The Hill Watson Report of 1954 was an extremely good report produced by Scotsmen on Scottish conditions, but I understand that it has been acted upon so far more in England than in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of the abstraction of water, a question which in due course must logically flow from this Bill. It is a considerable problem. If large quantities of water are taken from the head of one river and removed to another catchment area, the quantity of water available to do the purifying and dilution of impurities lower down the river is reduced. There is also the question of public health generally. We may have to have another public health Act dealing with the cleanliness of rivers. There is the question of flood prevention which, I believe, must be treated more on a river purification authority basis than on the basis of authorities in whose area there are sections of the rivers being regarded as authorities controlling flood prevention. The river boards are res-
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
ponsible for purification and the same should go for flood prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of water resources, the English produced the Water Resources Act, 1963. We have not got round to it yet but we must seriously tackly it in conjunction with this Bill, perhaps on the lines of a water conservation Bill by which we can best adapt English legislation to the Scottish situation and machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point which hinges on the Bill is the question of boundaries for which purification boards are responsible. We have great difficulties, for instance, with the Tweed in that most of it runs through Scotland, yet a whole section of the catchment area south of Berwick comes under the Northumberland authorities who are perhaps not quite as interested in what goes on beyond their boundaries as the Tweed river boards would be if they were responsible. This is something which should be reviewed at an early date, if not in conjunction with this Bill then in connection with future legislation on rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems likewise arise with the Solway Firth. I hope that the Under-Secretary will do his best to gain some measure of sensible control on a geographical basis rather than on a basis of a national boundry which runs through the rivers. The South Esk, for example, flows through Scotland and eventually goes into the Solway and the Tweed. In some respects it is regarded as an English river and this produces unnecessary complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important point, on which comment was made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns, concerns the farming community. If we are to have the fullest co-operation which we all want to see in future it is essential that farmers, among others, should be told as clearly as possible what is expected of them. Silage effluent must be considered seriously. I am sure that if all farmers were aware that silage can do considerable damage by pollution they would be prepared to co-operate, particularly in view of the fact that silage effluent is a valuable fertiliser when properly cleaned, mixed and sprayed on the land at the right time. If farmers were made aware of the ways in which they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
can help and of their responsibilities, it would go a long way towards ensuring the success of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, for one, will do my best to support the Under-Secretary in the passage of the Bill. We on this side of the Committee will do our best to make sure that it is as good a Bill as it can possibly be. I am sure that we shall all give a great deal of time and thought to every possible way in which we can improve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will have the support of both sides of the Committee in the aim which he stated at the conclusion of his speech, when he said that the purpose of the Bill was to recover and retain Scotland's national heritage of clear and sparkling rivers. That image prompts two questions. Firstly, will the Bill achieve that purpose? Secondly, how far did the 1951 Act help to achieve the purpose as we see things today?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1951 Act created the river purification boards. Their purpose was to control the river from its source to the sea and to try to keep its water clear. I asked my hon. Friend when he was speaking what improvements had taken place in the purity of river water and he named those rivers which he knew had improved. Unfortunately where I live, and during the course of my travels throughout Scotland, I have never seen the evidence which my hon. Friend has seen. I have seen evidence to the contrary. Rivers which I know well are dirtier today than they were before 1951.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the pattern was varied and I pointed out that some rivers had become worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make it difficult for my hon. Friend I think I quoted him fairly. I wrote down his words. I think that he spoke of an overall improvement, but I say that within the overall improvement I have seen rivers and streams which are now worse than they were before. I attribute that to the fact that the boards took far too long to create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For nearly five years I asked the Minister responsible when the boards would be in operation. Finally, I gave up the job. In 1956 or 1957, the final
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
question I asked on the subject was when the river purification boards would be in full working order. That was nearly six years after the introduction of the Act and the boards were still not in full operation and in some cases not even created. That is one of the reasons why progress has been retarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The boards may not have done as much as my hon. Friend would have desired, but the then Secretary of State for Scotland was very late in appointing them and that was not the responsibility of the boards. I remind my hon. Friend that, once established, the boards had the difficult duty of ascertaining the cost of bringing about combinations of local authorities so as to establish combined sewage purification works, which took a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was not giving me his usual acute attention, the attention which I deserve from one whom I respect very much. I said, as clearly as human words could convey my thoughts, that I asked the Minister responsible what he was doing. My hon. Friend must have missed that. Of course, the Minister was responsible. The creation of the boards was within his power, but, like a good Tory Minister, he had all the excuses in the world about the difficulties he was finding in getting these people together. He said that that was what was causing the delay. It is not for me to go back in pointing out one of the reasons why the Act did not operate as it should have operated, but one of the reasons was clearly slowness of Ministerial action. I hope that putting it definitely like that will satisfy my hon. Friend as much as it satisfies me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Secondly, the 1951 Act established new codes of control with byelaws which had to be confirmed by the Secretary of State. In that we made a totally wrong approach, because we defined cleanliness in terms of minimum pollution instead of in terms of the purity of the water. That provided all sorts of escape routes for industrialists and others who did not want to incur the expense—and farmers, too, who incur expense mostly when the Government pay it for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
At that time, industrialists said mat if they had to purify their trade effluent before it entered the river, they wanted to know whether they would be charged with the cost; so they asked whether they could not discharge trade effluent and waste water through local authority sewerage systems. Having no answer to that question, the then Government established a committee under Sheriff Hill Watson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally, I have asked what has happened to that committee. Has my hon. Friend now found out anything about it? I know that he is not responsible, but perhaps in due course we shall hear what was recommended by this committee which was set up to deal with the serious problem of whether industrialists would pay for the discharge of their effluent through the sewerage systems of local authorities, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston has already said, were often already overused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not far from where I live there is a sewerage system for what is almost a whole new town but which was constructed to get rid of the effluent of the small village of Thornliebank. It is already overcharged, and yet industrialists in the area want to use that system to get rid of their own trade effiuent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the specific aspect with which I should like to deal, if I can catch your eye later, Mr. Steele.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend always has his eye on the main chance, but I object to being used as a tool in his advancement in catching your eye, Mr. Steele.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tidal waters are being brought within this legislation, for half a mile up the Clyde and half a mile up the Forth. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) had some nasty things to say about the Clyde. As one who lives very near the Clyde, I thoroughly endorse what he said. But he forgot to add that Glasgow Corporation does a great deal, more than he realises, to keep the Clyde clean. The difficulty lies in the fact that the 1951 Act gave us very little power to control authorities in the environment of Glasgow. I take Busby as an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cart flows near my door, not too near, fortunately. That is the Black
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Cart. Hon. Members know that there are two Carts, the Black Cart and the White Cart, although the White Cart is as black as the Black Cart, so black that it does not deserve to be called "White". It leaves Kilbirnie Loch a pure, scintillating river in which one can catch very nice trout, but by the time it reaches Renfrew one would be choked before one drowned in it, because of its muck and dirt. From Busby down to Renfrew Bridge the Black Cart presents the darkest outlook that any potential suicide looking over the bridge could possibly see. He would be not drowned but lost in a sea of mud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what happens under the present Act. Control is non-existent. Can my hon. Friend give some assurance that the Bill will be more effective in curing the problem of pollution and preventing our rivers from becoming noxious streams as they enter our industrial cities? As many of my hon. Friends know, some of the nicest fishing is to be found further up the Cart, but by the time it reaches Busby, eight or nine miles outside Glasgow, the Cart is polluted as the Clyde is polluted until it reaches the sea. At present, control of tidal waters is not a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made it perfectly clear that I accept my hon. Friend's aim. It is an excellent aim. What we want to know is whether my hon. Friend has the machinery which will enable him to carry out what he and all hon. Members want to do, which is to have rivers worthy of Scotland. The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) sought to solve the problem of the Tweed by saying that a bit of that river was in England, but he forgot to say that that bit of England belongs to Scotland. We ought to think not only of the fact that it is in England but of our historic rights over it to keep it clean as it flows through that part of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who took part in the debates on the 1951 legislation will appreciate that this is essentially a Committee Bill. We all have very pleasant recollections of the Committee meetings that we had and the long speeches then made—longer than some of those being made in this Second Reading debate. The Second Reading debate then ran for two days. I hope that everyone will have an opportunity to speak on this Second
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Reading, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) who is so properly worried about the use of rivers by the paper industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that there is no solution to the problem of getting rid of that un-savoury element which clusters on the surface not only of the rivers in his part of, the country, but of the River Kelvin which flows through Glasgow. Scientists now say that sort of effluent can be treated to get rid of pollution. We shall have much more to say about the Bill later, but I conclude now by congratulating my hon. Friend on the way in which he has introduced the Bill this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to begin by congratulating the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State on his new office. I have often crossed swords with him not only in this Committee, but also when he was a spokesman for naval affairs. I always found him a very fiery opponent. Obviously, like a well-bred horse, he is best when in harness, as we have seen today, and I wish him well in our future debates on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, one of the last Bills with which the party opposite was concerned when last in office related to the prevention of river pollution. That was in 1951. I am glad that, on their return to power, the first Bill introduced by hon. Members opposite should also be on what we all regard as this very important matter. However, it is worth pointing out that on both occasions hon. Gentlemen opposite followed the lead given from this side of the Committee. I understand that much work on the preparation of the Bill was done under the administration of my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), and it may be forgotten that the parent Act of 1951 followed a Private Member's Bill introduced by the then Member for Galloway, a Bill of which I had the honour of being one of the sponsors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I approve most heartily of the efforts to prevent pollution—and this Bill is an example of those efforts—I wish that the results of the improvement were a little more visible. Technically, perhaps, pollution may be less than it was before. I am not competent to judge whether, technically, that is so, but I can see very
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
few, if any, visible signs of improvement in the river that I know best—the River Ayr.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is what is seen that really counts. Some people seem to think that as long as a river is not so polluted as to prevent the fish living in it, that is all that counts. I agree that fishing is very important. It is a sport that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) and I well know is enjoyed, in our part of the country at least, by ordinary folk. It is not a pastime or sport reserved only for rich people. But a river that is sufficiently clean to support fishing can still be polluted in the sense that it lacks the bright, clear and sparkling qualities of the really pure stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what we want to work towards rather more vigorously than we have done in the past, not only for the sake of those people in the area who have to look at the river—or even smell it, which is worse—every day of their lives, but also because of the increasing importance of the tourist industry to Scotland's economy. People will not be attracted to a country that has dirty and ugly rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I frankly admit to being rather disappointed by the results of the 1951 Act. I thought that that Act was designed to prevent new pollution, and after it had been passed there would be no new pollution. Unfortunately, Section 28 of that Act allows pollution if the purification board consents. It specifically provides that consent must not be unreasonably withheld, which opens wide the door to all sorts of new pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened seems to be that when a big development which may pollute the river is about to take place, the board is afraid to withhold consent, perhaps because it thinks that to do so may damage employment in the district—something about which people are always sensitive—or that it will delay the work, or make it so costly as to prevent the development. The board does not wish to accept responsibility for holding up or, perhaps, denying the area a development that would otherwise come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of this was the establishment in Ayrshire of the great new coal pit at Killoch. That development was allowed to proceed, although it resulted in a flood of what I can only describe as the most disgusting black water I have ever seen coming from the coal pit via a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
little stream into the Ayr, discolouring the river, and littering its banks with coal dust instead of the golden sand that formerly was there. It seems monstrous that, in these days, such a condition should be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the very sort of thing I had hoped the 1951 Act would prevent. Such pollution is the sort of anti-social action to which the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) referred. He seemed to think that only private industries, interested in profits, would cause that, but public industry is equally guilty. Indeed, it is harder to get at, because it is so big. I can only speak from my own experience, and other hon. Members may have different experience of the rivers they know, but I think that the real culprits are not the members of private industry at all, but public concerns like the National Coal Board, as in this case of the new pit at Killoch. Strangely enough, the Milk Marketing Board is also a big culprit because its effluent is most damaging to river life, as it uses up all the oxygen in the water.

When this sort of pollution is being created, not by private industry seeking a profit—and we can understand that, even if we do not sympathise with it—but by public industry which is supposed to have a social conscience, how are we to make progress?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the purpose of speeches on both sides of the Committee was to welcome the broad purposes of this Bill, but the hon Gentleman seems to be taking the opportunity to attack public industry. Is he not aware that my hon. Friend specified the Coal Board and, since he tells us that all this is happening in public industry, will he tell us who, until recently was in political control for 13 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am giving the hon. Member or the Committee that impression. I was trying to say that though one can naturally expect private industry, which is concerned with profit for its shareholders, perhaps to take an irresponsible and anti-social attitude—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That is the line hon. Members opposite always take, and one of their reasons for attacking private industry, but here we find public industry behaving in exactly the same way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Tory Party asks it to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter that involves our whole sense of values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite frankly, because of that, I do not expect a very great deal to come out of this Bill. In fact, my feelings are very much the same as those of the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). This Bill is certainly a step in the right direction. It will probably help to reduce pollution somewhat, but I do not think that it will result in making our rivers really clean—certainly not if my experience in Ayrshire is any guide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for my fears is that the river purification authorities will almost certainly not be any more tough in the conditions they impose on existing pollution—they have a certain discretion here—than the boards have been under the 1951 Act in dealing with new pollution. I recognise that that is partly because in such matters it is necessary to proceed in a practical way—one cannot be too idealistic, and that often results in hardly any progress at all being made—but the reluctance to be tough may also be partly due to the fact that the composition of the boards represents interests which may not be as anxious as they might be to see the rivers really clean, because it could mean extra expenditure for local authorities, for industry, or even for farmers. These are the people who, I understand are most strongly represented on the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I am afraid that we shall not make as much progress as we would like to make unless, of course, the Minister of State prods the authorities on a bit. I do not know to what extent he can do that, or will do that. Perhaps, in addition to prodding them on, he could give them some financial inducement, because I think that without some sort of pressure or inducement there will always be a tendency to make exceptions. That is a real danger, because as long as there are exceptions we shall never get our rivers really clean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want is a new approach and a real determination to see that our rivers are clean. In the old days, it was the streets of our towns that were the receptacle for sewage and garbage of all kinds. I believe that in Edinburgh—I do not know whether the same was true of Glasgow—the people pitched filthy water on to the streets, merely crying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
"Gardez l'eau"—"Look out for the water"—before discharging it on to people's heads. That was all taken as perfectly reasonable and sensible. After all, what were roads for if not for collecting the garbage and effluent from people's houses? Although I do not know, I imagine that when this was prevented there would be a terrible hullabaloo, and talk of the prohibitive cost of making people have drains in their houses. We have advanced in respect of roads, but our rivers are still regarded as a cheap form of sewer. One can find everything in them—old bedsteads, rubbish, sewage and trade effluent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions about the nature of effluent that this Bill and the parent Act permit to go into a river will obviously clean it, but just as people are not allowed to put effluent, however treated, from their houses into the street, so I wonder whether people should not be prevented from putting effluent, however treated, into the rivers. I realise that now the hon. Gentleman has responsibilities on his shoulders he will regard such a suggestion as being rather radical and revolutionary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am very interested in the hon. Gentleman's proposals. I am particularly interested in his condemnation of appointments to the boards made by his right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State. I thought that a rather fascinating part of his speech. I also wondered who he would propose to put on the purification authorities, because the majority of the representatives on the present boards are local authority people, who are responsible to the ratepayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point, because I am not certain that this whole approach is not wrong. That is why I say that my suggestion may be considered rather revolutionary and radical. I do not believe that we will get our rivers clean while effluent goes into them on anything like the present scale. It is the amount of effluent quite as much as the degree of cleanliness that is the trouble. Because of continual abstraction, there is not sufficient clean water left to take away the effluent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then perhaps the hon. Gentleman will support my suggestion that the courts ought to lay down, not minimum standards of pollution but standards of purity for river water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that something even more radical than that is not required, but what I would like to see is the hon. Gentleman's advisers thinking about the possibility of preventing any effluent at all from going into our rivers. I recognise that it is not something that can be done straight away, but it may be the ultimate answer. I should like the hon. Gentleman's advisers to think about the creation of a drainage system that, instead of taking effluent into our rivers—and that is what happens now; although it may go through the sewage works, it finishes up in the rivers—would dump three or four miles out to sea, or perhaps even further, where it could not contaminate the beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We bring water a long way from its sources to industry, and I cannot see why, in the same way, we should not dump industrial and other effluent miles out at sea. I recognise that this would be expensive, but when one is living in an industrial age, as we are, the quality of life in an industrial country deteriorates unless the community is prepared to spend some of the wealth that industry creates for it in restoring the amenity which industry destroys in creating that wealth. This applies particularly to rivers. It cannot be a one-way movement; we must restore to nature part of what we take away. Otherwise, the surroundings will not be worth living in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, while I welcome this Measure—perhaps the Committee thinks that I do not welcome it—and while I think that it is better than nothing, I urge the Minister of State not to be content merely with this Bill, which at best can only modify a thoroughly unsatisfactory state of affairs. I should like him to recognise this Bill as an additional stop-gap and not the answer to the problem. Then he should get down straight away to seeing if there are ways and means, perhaps on the lines I have suggested, of preventing rivers from being used as sewers and so that they can be a delight to the country instead of the abomination which many of them now are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister of State on his maiden speech in his present position. I think it is a great advance that we have the Minister of State available in the Scottish Grand Committee instead of one hidden in the cloistered recesses of another place where we are not in touch with him. I wish my hon. Friend many good opening speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased that additional powers are being given to try to create cleaner rivers throughout Scotland and cleaner estuaries around our shores. I must admit that I have doubts about the Bill accomplishing a great deal. I am nevertheless certain that we should all try to do everything in our power to improve it in Committee. I am certain that there is a great deal of good will in the objectives of the Bill. I hope the hon. Member for Pollok—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hillhead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always get mixed up about seats which are likely to be lost. I hope the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) will forgive me in not following too closely his contribution, but I agree with him in the proposition he put that more money should be spent in segregating sewage and other noxious effluents and not putting them into streams and rivers. He will know that Ayr County Council has spent large sums of money and created a completely new sewerage system, taking in the Garnock Valley and depositing the effluent in the sea at Stevenston. This has made a complete change in the river. The conditions for angling are quite unrecognisable compared with those before the scheme was carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am prepared to admit that there may have been some improvement arising from the main Act of 1951, many of our rivers are still a complete disgrace and there is still great destruction of flora and fauna. I ask my hon. Friend who opened this debate and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, if they are sure that enough power is being given to river boards for them to prosecute when prose-
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
cution is necessary. From my close study of the problem and my contact with angling clubs in my constituency, this appears to be necessary. There are many angling clubs throughout Ayrshire, indeed throughout Scotland, which have plenty of proof of pollution. It costs them many hundreds of pounds—it must be many thousands throughout Scotland—because of the destruction of trout in the rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Periodically whole stretches of rivers have their angling resources destroyed. It takes three or four years for a recovery to take place. This is a very terrible problem for angling clubs in my constituency. Most angling clubs in Scotland are comprised of working class men who contribute what they can from their wages. They feel very strongly about the destruction of resources in this way. Perhaps action could be taken to some extent to obviate the destruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Section 28(4) of the main Act there are stipulations laid down about conditions of effluents put into a river. Are they operated in such a way that they can be varied according to the different conditions in a river? In winter most of the conditions in our rivers are not too bad. There are periodic spates which effectively clean the river and help to clear out the effluent which has been deposited, but in the summer months, during periods of drought, there is a worsening of conditions throughout the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases there are stipulations about compensatory water from reservoirs upstream to help during conditions of drought, but that is not always possible. River boards should be armed with powers so that during drought conditions they can take effective action to protect and safeguard fish life. Whether it is trout, salmon or sea trout is immaterial when a river is running low because of drought. Obnoxious effluents ought not to be allowed into the streams at those times to the extent to which they are allowed in periods when they do not cause so much destruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extraction of water, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Hillhead, is a problem which should be looked at. There may be a compensating flow of water, but that is sometimes difficult to arrange in periods of drought. There may not be compensatory water available when it is most needed. There should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
be a far more rigorous application of provisions about compensatory water from reservoirs upstream. I do not know what checks are made and what action is taken when agreements are broken, as I am sure they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of our rivers are quite unable to cope with the volume of obnoxious effluent which is poured into them. I should like the Under-Secretary in reply to tell us to what extent consideration is given before allowing more obnoxious effluent to enter a river in addition to the volume already allowed. Would there be some control by the river board, or the planning authority, about the siting of a particular industry, or allowing domestic effluent to enter a river? It should be laid down that this effluent should be conveyed in some other way, possibly through sewers, so that it should not enter the river at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A whole host of trade effluents enter our rivers and estuaries, and many of them are most obnoxious. There is effluent deposited from nationalised industries. It is quite wrong that tons of coal dust should be swept down into the lower reaches of a river, often causing flooding because the deposit silts up the river. It also causes destruction of flora and fauna. I see no reason why there should not be settling tanks into which the coal dust could be drawn before it leaves a colliery. We would then get a far cleaner flow of water. It is appalling to see the condition in which lesser streams enter main rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the criticism about the Milk Marketing Board. I have seen the effect of that in the River Ayr, but there are other organisations which can be criticised. Breweries are very bad in this respect. Theirs must be a most potent effluent. Possibly other hon. Members know more about this than I do, but when I see the sparkling products of some breweries I think that the residue which they get rid of must be very noxious. I hope it will be recognised that there is a whole range of effluents which should not be deposited in our rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if a more explanatory memorandum could be made available in connection with Schedule 3, which says, in paragraph 7:
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A line drawn from NH84755680 near the fishing station to the seaward end of the east pier at NH88885753 and thence to the Nairn-Auldearn parish boundary at NH89915747."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To save a lot of time in quoting all the estuaries which are affected, may I say that if it is the wish of the Committee, we will provide hon. Members with maps of these estuaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very good. To make it even simpler, can my hon. Friend show us the areas in Scotland which are not covered? We are told what is covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will see from the maps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring in particular, of course, to rivers. If we knew what, if anything, was being left out, it might be much clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should not only pay great attention to the question of pollution, but should link it, if possible, with the necessity to conserve water. If we have proper conservation and money spent in this direction by the Government, I am sure that this will help enormously in the allied question of pollution. We do not do nearly enough for conservation and, consequently, we get a far greater volume of complaint about pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to know from my hon. Friend when he replies to what extent the main onus for expenditure in connection with the Bill is to be carried by local authorities. While I know that there is provision in the Bill for general Exchequer grant, this is a drop in the ocean. We will not get the success in these measures that we should if all the time the Government merely pass these things on to the laps of local authorities and expect them willy-nilly to increase their rateborne expenditure to comply with the provisions of the Bill. There is a limit beyond which local authorities cannot go in rates. The implications of the rate burdens are sufficiently evident to anyone who takes an interest in local government. I should like to know that through the Bill there will be real help for the local authorities and that they will not be merely saddled with the financial onus and told that they will get something small back in general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Exchequer grant. We can, perhaps, improve the Bill somewhat in Committee and I shall be prepared to take an active part to that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is any Member of the Committee who does not agree with the general intent of the Bill, but there are a great many practical difficulties in connection with it. In pointing some of them out, I am trying to be helpful to the Minister rather than destructive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing that occurs to me is that the river pollution authorities or the river purification boards are a misnomer, because they are not purification boards or authorities at all. They have no powers to act in any way except to give or to withhold consent and to instigate prosecutions. If we are to achieve anything by legislation of this type, we must give these boards or authorities power to act by way of purification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote an instance from my constituency. The River Don flows into the sea just north of Aberdeen. It is a pure river until it reaches the tidal reach. At that point, at the Bridge of Balgownie—which is probably shown more on postcards than any other scene in Scotland except Balmoral Castle—it begins to become extremely offensive. In fact, the question which I was asked more than any other at the recent election was what I would do about the smell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cause of that smell is that the river, carrying down with it a certain amount of pollution, meets unsavoury water coming in from the sea. At low tide, a certain amount of very undesirable material is deposited on the banks, although until it reaches that point the river is adequately pure. Obviously, this is not a matter for any one local authority, because the pollution from up river comes from, perhaps, half a dozen local authority areas. It seems to me that at that point the river purification board should have power to deal with the disposal of any undesirable material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, nobody has any responsibility for this difficulty because, the local authorities are mostly small ones and the Government do not seem to undertake any responsibility. I should like
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
to know what action the Minister of State is prepared to take to give river purification boards real authority to deal with a situation of this kind and what financial contribution he will make, because this seems to me to be a national affair and not a matter for any small burgh or even a county council to undertake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The lion. Member is speaking about the River Don, with which I am conversant. Is he not aware that the relevant board has for many years been endeavouring to get the Government, and in particular the last Secretary of State, to take that matter in hand with a view to purifying the river?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course that is so. The difficulty, however, is that until that point, the river is comparatively pure and inoffensive, but it becomes offensive when it reaches the tidal waters. That is not a matter for any one local authority. The two local authorities concerned at that point are Aberdeen County Council and Aberdeen Town Council. It is a joint matter for them, but the pollution is caused not necessarily by them but, perhaps, by a number of factors further up river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a national or river matter. The river purification board should be given authority to deal with it and to raise finance, whether by requisition, Government grant or otherwise. I ask the Minister of State to give great thought to this and to give power to the boards and constitute them as real river authorities to deal with such situations where the local authority is not the appropriate authority to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my first point. It is important because cost comes into it. The cost may be very great. It may entail the formation of a trunk sewer for a considerable portion of the river. This is beyond the means of any local authority. Indeed, it would not be possible to apportion it to any local authority. The Minister of State must think deeply about this and say how far he is prepared to contribute towards the cost. This is a desirable aim. It is a matter not for one local authority, but for general contribution either from taxation or from the whole area of the river.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is suggesting, I understand, that sewage should be the subject of 100 per cent. Government grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say 100 per cent. Government grant. However, there comes a point on any river where the responsibility is that of the central Government and not necessarily of the small local authorities which cumulatively cause the pollution without in any one case producing an undesirable effluent. It may be a matter of 100 per cent. grant or it may not. I shall come to local authorities presently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purification of sewage is a serious responsibility for any local authority. I know of one small burgh with a population of about 800 which is promoting a sewage purification scheme costing £50,000. I understand that the Secretary of State has agreed to give a 30 per cent. grant, but even at that it becomes a heavy expenditure for a small local authority. If one takes all the local authorities concerned in a river, cumulatively the cost may amount to a substantial sum which may have a serious effect upon the national economy. The Secretary of State, therefore, has a grave duty to advise and, possibly, to control river purification boards, because if a board acts in an unreasonable way or even too vigorously it may have an effect on the national economy, as well as the economy of the area, which cannot be justified in any year. I do not know what thought the Secretary of State has given to this matter, but I suggest that it requires very careful thought. Otherwise, the effects upon local authorities may be completely beyond their means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pass now to the question of trade effluents. I believe that the paper industry, with which I am closely connected in my constituency, has gone a great way to improve its effluents in its own interests, because a great many of the polluting matters passed formerly by the paper mills into rivers are worth recovering. I am, however, advised that there is an irreducible minimum which comes from a paper mill and which cannot be dealt with practically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It then becomes a question of whether a local authority is bound to take trade effluents into its sewers. This has been done successfully on the Aberdeenshire
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Dee, a perfectly clean river, where the paper mill in question has reached a suitable agreement with the local authority, which accepts the efflulent and takes it to the sea in its sewer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, no obligation on local authorities in Scotland to receive trade effluents. That is not the position in England and Wales. In England, under the Public Health (Drainage of Trade Premises) Act, 1937, industry is given certain rights to discharge its effluent into local authority sewers. Naturally, the local authority has the right to make a proper charge. It seems to me that such an arrangement would be complementary to the Bill which is now before us. Lord Hill Watson in his report recommended this in the case of Scotland, and it seems to me that if we are to achieve success in legislation to secure pure rivers, similar legislation must be introduced in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we reach the Committee stage, I ask the Minister of State to consider introducing into the Bill something similar to the provisions of the English Act of 1937 to enable proper arrangements to be reached between local authorities and traders on the river banks. This matter is extremely important, especially concerning smaller firms. The big firms usually do not find much difficulty in putting down their own purification plants, but a small firm with a strong effluent may find it almost impossible to do so. Something of this sort is not only desirable, but strictly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is to ask what standards will be laid down for pollution. What will be considered to be pollution? A great many firms are purifying to the extent that their effluent is not harmful to either fish or vegetable life. Is that standard to be maintained or will a higher standard be imposed? I am advised by a paper mill in my constituency that to impose a higher standard than is now produced would involve expenditure of no less than £140,000. For any one factory, no matter how big, to contemplate expenditure of that nature to produce what it regards as an unreasonably high standard is not practical politics, as the Minister of State will probably agreee. Guidance must be given not only to industry, but to river purification authorities, about the standard of purification required in these cases.

We have in the paper-making areas ground for being apprehensive. The 1951 Act used the word "reasonably" throughout. I am extremely concerned to find that in the Second Schedule to the Bill, those "reasonable" provisions are being cut out. I should like to know from the Government why the following words appear in Schedule 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 22—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>in subsection (4) the words '(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)' shall be omitted;"</p></blockquote>
and why the Bill then proceeds to omit those words in a great many cases. It seems to me that this will give powers to the river purification authorities to act unreasonably. I hope that the Government will give an assurance that these provisions will not be imposed unreasonably but that the practical difficulties will be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member envisage a situation where the standards may vary from river authority to river authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well happen, and that is why I am asking the Government to declare the standards which they will lay down in these cases. It seems to me that the standards must be reasonable, at any rate until such time as tank sewers are provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that in practice local authorities and other bodies may be asked to reach a certain first stage and later when it becomes practicable to go further and achieve a greater degree of purity? Is not that the common practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but the 1951 Act made it clear that the thing must be operated reasonably and the present Bill takes out the provision about consent not being unreasonably withheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there is the provision that the authorities are now enjoined to state their reasons in writing, and since full appeal procedure is provided it is clearly still reasonable. This is a Committee point, but a valid one. I hope that I have explained it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is as it may be, but I ask the hon. Gentleman when summing
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
up to give some indication of these standards of reasonableness which will be applied because, as I have pointed out, these requirements may mean a big sum for an individual factory. A sum of £140,000 is a substantial figure for any private firm, whatever it may be for the Government. If standards are to be high, what contribution will the Government make? We in Scotland, and especially in North Scotland, suffer great disadvantages compared with our competitors in the South. I am told by the paper mill which I have already mentioned that its extra transport costs to the South of England amounts to as much as £50,000 a year. Therefore, if any undue burden such as that proposed in the Bill is laid upon these firms it may make their whole operations uneconomic and as a result we may lose industries to the South. I hope that the Under-Secretary will keep that in mind and will give us some guidance about what is required of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which I admit is a Committee point but is an important one concerns the procedure laid down in the Bill. It is provided that every person discharging effluent into a river must apply for consent in the terms of the Bill itself. This seems to me to be a most cumbersome way of dealing with the matter. The river authorities will be flooded with a tremendous number of applications for consent from little innocent effluents. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> That is what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say "innocent".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a septic tank which purifies the effluent before it flows into a stream. I believe that the effluent is as pure as it is possible to make it and the local sanitary inspector seems quite satisfied with it. Must I apply to the river purification authority for consent to continue to discharge that effluent from my private tank into the stream? This is apparently what the Bill provides. If that is so, where is this matter to stop? The river authority may well be inundated with thousands of applications of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the Bill seem to be far too stringent. I ask the Minister of State to consider modifying them to provide for the initiative to come from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
river authorities where they consider that the effluent is undesirable. It should be up to them to select the effluents and deal with them where they consider them to be undesirable. This seems to me to be the only practical way. I am told that there is a tremendous scarcity of engineers to deal with these things. If we are to deal with them all at one and the same time we shall have an impossible task. I am told that local authorities advertise for engineers at high salaries and attract them away from other authorities. This is a long-term business. The best people to decide about the length of the term are the river authorities themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me sensible that instead of calling upon everyone who is responsible for discharging effluent to apply for consent, we should leave it to the river purification authority to deal with those effluents which it chooses as and when it can. I suggest a procedure analogous to that which applies to the control of advertisements for planning permission where consent is granted more or less automatically for a short period—in the case of advertisements it is five years—and the person concerned does not have to apply again unless he is challenged on the ground that the advertisement is undesirable. The same might apply here where the effluent might be regarded as unexceptionable until it was challenged at the end of a period. These are all practical difficulties. Now is the time to raise them rather than in the Committee stage so as to give the Government time to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite in extending our congratulations to you, Mr. Steele, on assuming the office which you occupy and to my hon. Friend the Minister of State for his excellent first appearance on the Government Front Bench this morning. I confess that among the many reasons why I desired a change of Government was the fact that sitting where they now sit hon. Members opposite will soon find that when the sun begins to stream through the windows it has a most blinding effect on one's thoughts and ideas. I longed for the day when we would be able to transfer to this side of the Committee and give the then members of the Government some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
medicine which we had had to endure in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) mentioned a question which he was asked during the election campaign. I am sorry that I was not with him, because I might have been able to give an answer. He was asked what would be done about the smell from the River Don. I will tell him in all humility that I have read that Beatles' breath is now being bottled. Possibly he could have bottled the smell from the River Don and sold it with picture post-cards of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Committee has shown abundantly clearly a recognition of the fact that wastage of so much of our river water through pollution is greatly to be deplored. We are asked why, since the passing of the 1951 Act, the pollution still continues. Various financial and practical difficulties have been cited but I want to highlight one particular aspect of the matter. Apart from any reason given by hon. Members opposite about storm damage and septic tank difficulties, I think that the greatest factor has been that we have too many overloaded sewage works. Many of them are of insufficient capacity. In some instances they deal with as much as two and three times the flow for which they were originally designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sewage flows are tending to increase not only because of the construction of new housing schemes and the connecting of larger volumes of sewage and trade waste to the sewers but also because of the tremendous rise in the domestic use of water due to the changing habits of the people and the higher standard of living. This means that sewage works must be correspondingly larger and therefore more expensive to construct. This is where I am inclined to agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeen, West that money can be a great factor in helping to solve the problem of river pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that local authorities are anxious to approve capital expenditure on this score, but this was reduced by the Government because they would not allow the local authorities to embark upon the tremendous capital expenditure which would be involved in bringing sewage purification plants up to the standard required to meet the need. This parsimonious attitude on the part of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
Ministry towards sewage disposal is probably the biggest single factor today contributing to continued pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authorisation of some of the schemes already suggested by local authorities would be a major step in the battle against pollution. There is little doubt that there is much unnecessary pollution by imperfectly treated sewage which could be avoided by the extension and modernisation of overloaded sewage disposal works. I would ask the Minister of State to look at how far the Government, by increasing grants to local authorities, are prepared to make a practical contribution in this direction. If the Government did that, they would take the greatest possible step towards a solution of this problem. Other ancillary methods provided for in the Bill would also contribute, but I re-emphasise that this is the greatest single contributory factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the fact that firms coming into various areas should consider from the public interest the siting of their new factories. It is unfair that local authorities should be saddled with the introduction of new factories on sites so far removed from the sewage system when this could have been avoided if it had been properly considered in the preliminary planning stage. Small local authorities are likely to be saddled with heavy expenditure on sewage purification plant in these cases. We should watch
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
the situation to see how far we can avoid difficulties created by very much-needed industrial concerns being sited in places away from the sewage system when this could have been avoided if the guidance and expert advice of local authorities had been sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which requires consideration is the time taken by the making of an application for consent, the report made on it, the right of the individual to appeal to the Secretary of State, and finally the hearing before the Court of Session. This is an important factor because as long as a firm does not vary the contents of the effluent which it discharges it can keep on discharging it for a very long time while the matter is going through all these processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
