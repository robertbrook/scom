<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered Class IV, Vote 13 (Roads, &c., Scotland).—<i>[Dr. Dickson Mabon.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good roads are undoubtedly the key to a modern industrial society, and certainly all of us who travel round Scotland cannot fail to be impressed by the enormous improvements which have been made to Scottish roads in the last few years. To take just a few cases which I know about personally, there has been the Prestwick by-pass, which in my experience has reduced the time it takes me to get from my part of the world to Glasgow by as much as 20 minutes. There has been the dual carriage way work on the A.75 connecting Glasgow with Carlisle. This is a most important route for Scotland because so much traffic from England to Scotland, and vice versa, uses this road. Indeed, a recent census has shown that 75 per cent. of Scottish industrial transport to England actually goes through Carlisle. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) made a good point the other day, although it was a point made in the wrong debate and about the wrong country—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the wrong vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—when he said that the road which leads south from Carlisle, particularly the section round about Kendal and Penrith, should be improved because it was most vital to Scotland, and I hope the Secretary of State will be able to use his influence with his colleagues to get this section improved. There are many other major improvements. There have been the improvements o the A.80, the Glasgow-Stirling road; the A.9, the Edinburgh-Stirling road; and the A.8, Glasgow-Edinburgh. Some of these are now up to motorway standard and all of them form the main arteries for the road com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
munications of Central Scotland. Indeed this amounts to a major modernisation.<br><br>
In addition we have seen several other great developments. There have been the two Whiteinch tunnels under the Clyde, the Tay Bridge, which is now nearing completion, and the Forth Bridge which is the fourth longest suspension bridge in the world and a great achievement for Scottish engineering.<br><br>
The last few years have not only been fruitful in achievement, but there, have also been many contributions to thought on traffic matters. I have in mind such Reports as Buchanan on "Traffic in Towns", the Hall Report on "Transport Needs in the Next 20 Years", Warboys on "Traffic Signs", Geddes on "Transport Licensing" and last but not least the Beeching Report on the modernisation of the railways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not forget the Kilbrandon report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that is another Vote.<br><br>
The conclusion which our Government came to was that a great expansion of the road programme was needed, and this indeed we have seen, because the spending on roads has approximately doubled since 1960. The Socialist attitude, though, has been much more equivocal. They welcomed the Buchanan Report and the Warboys Report. As far as one can see they are not very enthusiastic about the Geddes Report on transport licensing. They were certainly violently opposed to the Beeching Report before the election but after the Election they seem to have adopted Dr. Beeching's policy, like so many other policies from the last Government, and, indeed, they have made some amends to Dr. Beeching by making him a lord quite recently.<br><br>
I would like to ask in the first place, now that the Socialists have formed a Government, whether they still follow the will o' the wisp of an "integrated transport policy", which proved to be so beautifully unclear during the last Election. For example, to many people it meant that the various forms of transport and their timetables would coincide; for instance, we should find that buses and aircraft seemed to meet and that the canals and railways also coincided. This was quite unexceptionable, but to other people it meant different things.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
To Mr. Gordon, my Socialist opponent in Galloway, it meant that branch lines would be kept open, and indeed he had a pledge to the effect that the Dumfries—Stranraer line would be kept open. That was apparently a pledge by Transport House which was subsequently dishonoured after the Election.<br><br>
To other people it meant that the goods traffic would be directed from the roads back on to the railways, and certainly in the last month or two we have begun to see a movement that way, when one thinks of the great increases in petrol prices and in licence fees which have been imposed by this Government, but I think if anyone examines the question carefully he will find there is not much scope for returning goods traffic to the railways. I recently read in the <i>Observer</i> an article by Lord Beeching, who is certainly no protagonist of road traffic, in which he pointed out that 90 per cent. of the carriage of goods is local, fine-scale distribution which the railways are and always have been quite unable to perform. As for the last 10 per cent., a big proportion of that is already going by the railways.<br><br>
I think, too, however much we may be personally annoyed about heavy lorries going slowly along the road and not being able to pass them, they are not really the cause of congestion on the roads.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McInnes. I would just like to ask you whether the Liberal Party is represented on this Committee. Is it not unfair that it should be excluded? I cannot see anyone here from the Liberal Party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Liberal Party are not present, then they excluded themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that road congestion is not caused so much by heavy lorries on the road as by the surfeit of motor cars at the entrances to towns and at other bottlenecks. I wonder whether the Under-Secretary has any thoughts on this question? Recently there have been pronouncements from certain trade unions, particularly the N.U.R., which is affiliated to the Labour Party—very strange pronouncements such as that motor cars will be licensed and controlled
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
and people should only have a motor car if they can get a licence.<br><br>
Another point I would like to turn to is the question of tolls on road bridges. Before the Election we saw in <i>Signposts for Scotland</i> the following statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is unjust that … tolls should still be imposed on essential bridges and ferries in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
Further down in the same pamphlet one saw
<br><blockquote><p>"Tolls must, therefore, … be abolished wherever their imposition is likely to prove a handicap to plans for industrial expansion."</p></blockquote>
I well remember reading before the Election an account of an Adjournment debate in which either the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) or the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs (Mr. Gourlay), both of whom are in their places this morning, pointed out that three industrial developments had been lost to Fife because of the tolls on the Forth Bridge. What is the position now? We seem to have complete silence from the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not followed as closely as he might what I have been saying, and said during the Election, on this point. In my Election programme I made the point that no matter what the Labour Party manifesto said I would still fight for the abolition of tolls. In this Parliament I have put pressure on the Secretary of State for Scotland for the abolition of tolls, and when the year is up the opposition to them will be intensified. We shall not rest till they are abolished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged for the explanation given by the hon. Gentleman but what we are interested in is what the Labour Party is going to do about tolls and not what the hon. Gentleman thinks about them. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to give us some firm information. I am sure his hon. Friends would be equally interested to hear it.<br><br>
On that same subject, is the Tay Road Bridge going to have tolls? Then again, what about Erskine Bridge, which will form such an important communication in the Glasgow area? Is it to go ahead at all? I read in the roads Report that it is to be a bridge 1,000 ft. long and 180 ft. high, and the highway authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
in Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire have both agreed as to the necessity for it and the financing of it, but so far they lack the approval from the Scottish Office.<br><br>
What, too, are the Government's plans for new traffic routes and motorways? If we turn to page 58 of the Report we see there the beginning of a most interesting account of the various stages in planning a new road, and in the first paragraph we see that the projects which are just entering into the roadmaking machine seem to be mostly by-passes, such as the Gretna by-pass. I think they were mostly schemes which were already there when the hon. Gentleman and his hon. and right hon. Friends arrived at the Scottish Office. There seems to be no mention of the Ayr by-pass anywhere, and yet during the Election Mr. Eddie, the Socialist candidate in Ayr, stated that the arrival of a Socialist Government would "clear up this mess immediately", and in this he was supported by an extremely distinguished resident who, unfortunately, since he has arrived at the Scottish Office seems to have come down to earth rather badly when considering the Scottish road programme. I refer, of course, to the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
A most pressing problem is that of the inner ring road in the City of Glasgow. It is pressing mainly because of congestion in the city, which has in fact been improved very much over the last year or two by studies of traffic engineering which have been undertaken, but also it is pressing because Glasgow redevelopment is being planned and is proceeding at present and if one is going to redevelop a city one may as well redevelop the highways when the buildings are redeveloped, thus saving a great deal of trouble later on.<br><br>
The scale of the roads in the City of Glasgow is really somewhat daunting. I was reading a description of them by a firm of consulting engineers who pointed out that 47 miles of roads within the city boundaries are to come up to motorway standards. There are to be eight miles of what are described as expressways and 22 miles of existing road will be raised to expressway standards. I understood that the first phase of these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
schemes was going out to tender this year, but as far as I can see there is no mention of this anywhere in the Scottish Roads Report at all.<br><br>
Other pressing problems, of course, are to be found in the City of Edinburgh, which, clearly, will need the orbital by-pass to the city from the Forth Road Bridge. I am glad to see the Government have at least proceeded so far that they have started on the traffic signs, so at least something has been done about this essential road. Other pressing problems surely must be the communications from Dundee to the South. We are building the wonderful new Tay bridge, but as far as I can make out nothing is being done to ensure the main communication artery between the Tay and Forth bridges.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I come now to the question of expenditure on roads and the classification of roads. The rate burden is extremely heavy and is likely to rise. When a trunk road or motorway enters a city boundary or the boundary of a large burgh, instead of being eligible for 100 per cent. grant, the grant is reduced to the same as for a class 1 road, or 75 per cent. It has been urged for many years that equating a large burgh with an English county borough is not entirely fair, because a large burgh in Scotland often has a smaller population, and it is not right to compare a place like, say, Dumfries with an English county borough like Darlington, Middlesbrough or Luton, which obviously are much bigger places and have much larger resources. The argument has always been that the burgh receives a good deal of benefit in trade from passing motor traffic.<br><br>
When building motorways and expressways through cities and burghs, surely the whole purpose of those roads is to stop people halting their cars and shopping in the cities and towns. The whole idea is to get traffic moving on. Surely we should reconsider this situation and, where there are expressways and motorways, give the same grant as we do to county councils for a trunk road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, but I should like to raise a point of order. There is a draught coming in behind me, Mr. McInnes, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
is bound to freeze the freedom of expression which, I hope, will ensue in this debate. Can this be attended to?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will see what I can do about the draught.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another point which the Government might consider is the War-boys new proposals which have been accepted for primary routes. This is largely a question of signs, because in future roads are to be signposted in a certain manner to make it much easier for a motorist to find his way through towns and conurbations and past junctions and road crossings. These specially signposted routes are to be known as primary routes. As far as I can see, there is little difference in the definition between the new primary routes and existing trunk routes. When, say, a primary route is a class 1 road, would it not be possible to transfer part of the expense and treat the road as a trunk road for purposes of grant? Both these suggestions would help slightly to reduce the burden of rates on authorities in Scotland.<br><br>
I turn from new roads to the question of existing classified roads. From the table on page 96 of the Road Development Report, it is interesting to see the priority which has been given to trunk roads over the last few years. Doing a calculation from the figures, I find that about £9,500 has been spent on each mile of, trunk road or motorway but that for classified roads the figure is only £850. Abount one-eleventh of the expenditure on roads is going to classified roads.<br><br>
I am sure it is true that with the increase in the number of motor cars the increase in speed and also the increase in the weight of traffic we are in danger of our classified roads cracking up completely under the load. This is particularly true in rural areas. One sees, for example, that the number of vehicles last year rose by 8 per cent., but in a rural county like Kirkcudbright the increase in traffic was no less than 19·2 per cent. We also know that the speed has increased, and quite often these days, in places where there have been rail closures, one sees large car transporters moving down a classified road. All this is bound to affect badly the state of the classified roads.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
As long ago as 1962 the last Government carried out an inquiry among all the road surveyors in Scotland to ascertain the cost of bringing the classified roads up to the proper standard in maintenance and minor repairs. All the road surveyors made detailed calculations and the answer came out that it would cost something like £5·8 million a year for 10 years. To many of us who are used to large sums that figure may not be particularly frightening, but I believe that the present Government have been quite unable to accept this figure, and we see in the Estimates this year that the figure granted is only £4·4 million.<br><br>
Is that to be the sort of figure which the classified roads get for maintenance and minor repairs over the next 10 years? If so, it is entirely inadequate and a farce. The Estimates were put forward at 1963 prices and today we see prices creeping up inexorably. Indeed, since the Government came to power they have gone up by 1d. in the £ every month. This programme is quite inadequate and is likely simply to be a farce.<br><br>
We have the Warboys signs and the Government have decreed that the new signs are to be in position by 31st December, 1967, which is about two and a half years away. These signs will cost an absolute minimum of £2 million throughout the whole of Scotland. The estimate for grant in this year's Estimates is only £150,000. To take one Scottish county alone, however—Stirlingshire—the cost of these signs will be £205,000 just for one county. That figure of grant surely must be pitifully inadequate. It is not possible for the Under-Secretary to expect the counties, by increased efficiency, productivity or whatever he likes, to take on their backs this very large burden. Indeed, I think that the programme will take, not 10 years, but much more like 20 years at the present rate.<br><br>
The policy, too, of the Scottish Office of concentrating on the heavily trafficked roads, from which I do not entirely dissent, will have a deleterious effect on the unclassified roads, which total no less than 11,500 miles in Scotland. They form the lifelines of the agricultural and forestry community. I suggest that the Government should revive a most useful little Act called the Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Act, 1955. Very little
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0234">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
money was involved in it—slightly over £1 million, I believe—but it proved extremely valuable in upland areas in Scotland where we have so much of this country.<br><br>
Another point on the same line concerns the Forestry Commission, which, being a nationalised body, is likely to appeal much more to hon. Members opposite—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say on behalf of the Committee how glad we are to see the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) coming to take part in our proceedings this morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Though late.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Forestry Commission is building considerable lengths of road for the purpose of extracting timber, quite often in beautiful scenery, like the 13 miles alongside Loch Shiel, in Inverness. This, I understand, is built entirely from forestry funds. On the other hand, there seems little reason why the tourist should not be allowed to use this road, particularly when the trees have grown up a certain extent. As hon. Members know, we have no National Parks Committee in Scotland. It seems to me that there would be point in giving a Government grant to assist the Forestry Commission in the provision of this sort of road—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three more of them to come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say much about the Highlands. With due respect to the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie), who, unfortunately, is not present, we all miss very much the annual contributions to our debates from Sir Jack MacLeod, who used always to keep us going on the Balgy Gap and the Bailey bridge at Conon Bridge and other problems which he found in his constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Look what happened to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is happening about the Bailey bridge at Conon Bridge now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
that we have a splendid, dynamic, radical Government with Liberal support? Is the bridge to be replaced? As far as I can see, the Under-Secretary has enough money to build the bridge but not enough the build the road connecting up to the bridge.<br><br>
I should mention the crofters' road programme. It is interesting to see that 700 miles of road have been completed in the Highlands. Adding up the scheme in the Blue Book, it appears to me that over £3 million is being committed to these roads. I am glad, too, to see that the approach roads to the pulp mill at Corpach are being strengthened and improved, but is it not madness to do nothing about the swing bridge over the Caledonian Canal at Banavie? This will cause a complete bottleneck. I understand that the Inverness County Council has put up a scheme for improving this bridge but that on each occasion it has been turned down by the Scottish Office.<br><br>
I do not know whether it is worth mentioning the Glenfeshie road. I know that the Under-Secretary is most interested in it. I hope that he will be able to tell us something about it and whether he is likely to have enough money to complete this necessary scheme.<br><br>
I should like to give the Under-Secretary two quotations. They are a year apart and we all know what happened in the course of that year. The first quotation is from his right hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. Strauss), who was then shadow Minister of Transport and was speaking, no doubt, with the full authority of the shadow Cabinet. Writing in the <i>Scotsman</i> of 7th December, 1963, the right hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Labour proposes a dynamic expansion of the road programme."</p></blockquote>
On 22nd December, 1964, the noble Lord, Lord Lindgren, now Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and a member of the Government, stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no possibility at present of augmenting the road programme in hand."</p></blockquote>
That is a most remarkable contrast.<br><br>
I end by giving hon. Members opposite a quotation from the Crowther Steering Committee to the Buchanan Report:
<br><blockquote><p>"Regarded in its collective aspect as 'the traffic problem' the motor car is clearly a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
menace which can spoil our civilisation. But translated into terms of the particular vehicle that stands in our garage (or more often nowadays, is parked outside our door, or someone else's door), we regard it as one of our most treasured possessions or dearest ambitions, an immense convenience, an expander of the dimensions of life, an instrument of emancipation, a symbol of the modern age. To refuse to accept the challenge it presents would be an act of defeatism."</p></blockquote>
We feel that the Socialist Party, with its integrated policy of transport and other out-of-date ideas, will lead to defeatism in the traffic problem in our country.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the final sentiments and one or two other remarks which the hon. Gentleman made, and which he no doubt had to do to encourage his own side in their desperate plight, I ought to congratulate the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) on a good and thoughtful speech. I will try to answer some of his points and perhaps later on I may be able to respond to those I do not acknowledge now.<br><br>
I do not propose to embark upon a dissertation about the Buchanan Report, the Geddes Report or about Beeching, for the reason that these are matters probably best ventilated in the House. So far as the Scottish Office and their connection with closures is concerned, we work closely with the Ministry.<br><br>
We have one great difference between what was the practice of the last Government and that of the new Government. In the Transport Act debates of 1962 we argued long, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele) that the S.T.U.C.C. should have the right to consider the case for closure not only on grounds of passenger inconvenience but on grounds of economic and social considerations. We were denied that. The Government voted us down. In that Act the remit to the S.T.U.C.C. is still as circumscribed as it has been under hon. Gentlemen opposite. It would take a new law to alter the remit. What we have done is to make sure that every proposed closure goes to the Scottish Economic Planning Council where automatically it is considered in an economic and social light. I have heard one or two members of the S.T.U.C.C. complain that their remit does not allow them to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
take obvious considerations in mind but confines them to considering the case strictly on passenger hardship. This is the first consequence of succeeding the previous Government. We have tried hard to make sure that the proposals that have come up have been dealt with through this method.<br><br>
When we succeeded to office, of the 51 Scottish proposals in the Beeching plan for closures, 50 had been published. Of the 50, 32 decisions had been taken, that is 63 per cent. of Scottish closures had been decided by the previous Government. Under the previous Government in England the pace of closures was only 40 per cent., so it shows how far under the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) closures took place in Scotland compared with England. Since October we have considered five cases and still have some under review. It is not an easy matter to deal with. We have every consideration of the Minister of Transport, himself a Scot. We are confident that with the advice of the Scottish Economic Planning Council and the new attitude of the Government to closures, the damage which might eventuate from Beeching will not take place. That is not to say we do not accept a great deal of what the good doctor, whom the Queen so recently ennobled, and quite rightly, for his services, did, or that, within his terms of remit, he did his job reasonably well. I cannot deal with a number of points about the integration of transport for these are matters for the Minister himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves this part of his speech, he spoke about inquiries being made about closures. What inquiries are being made about the damage inflicted on various industries in north-east Scotland, such as the fishing industry, through being deprived of the means of transport which they have enjoyed for generations? Will he take steps to see that these industries in the north of Scotland and the transport to and from them are adequately protected?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought the hon. Member was going to ask a question, but it is developing into a speech. In any case, the debate this morning is confined exclusively to roads.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt my hon. Friend's questions are good ones but they could be dealt with in the debate which we are to have, I am glad to say, on the regions. I take his point. It is a fair one.<br><br>
Now may I come to the substance of this morning's exercise? I had a delightful experience crossing Strome Ferry this year when I met the former hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty, Sir John MacLeod who regaled me with wonderful stories of his election meetings particularly about the Conon Bridge. I know he misses his friends in the House and very much wanted to be remembered to us all. I found him entertaining about that bridge and have seen it myself. It is a natural desire of Ministers to see all these particular problems that we hear about in debates for ourselves, because it is surprising what intense understanding it gives to Ministers when they are offered advice.<br><br>
This year, the Estimate that we are considering shows an increase of about £5·6 million from slightly over £24 million to slightly under £30 million. If hon. Members study the diagram on page 51 of the Report they will see that this is the biggest annual increase so far, while in relation to the previous year's figure it is the biggest for six years. I am pleased to note that if one were to draw the new increase on that diagram it would go off the page because it is so large.<br><br>
In more detail, £5·2 million of the increase is on new construction and major improvements, of which trunk roads and motorways are to get £3·6 million and classified roads £1·6 million. In addition, as the hon. Member rather grudgingly recognised, there is an increase of £0·5 million on maintenance and minor improvements, and on the remaining subheads taken together a decrease of £100,000, mainly because of a once-for-all payment last year to the British Transport Commission arising from the guarantee under which improvements were made to the Forth ferry service about ten years ago. This year I am glad to announce that the Secretary of State is launching a 10-year programme of maintenance and minor improvements. The 10 per cent. addition to the provision for "works" under the subhead which provides for grants on the maintenance of classified roads is important because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
it has enabled him to do so. The increase in the provision for maintenance is slightly larger than the figures appear to indicate because last year's payments include certain special items.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's new 10-year programme is to give local authorities a long-term financial framework in which they can plan systematic strengthening and minor improvement of their roads to meet the needs of modern traffic. The old system, which we inherited from our predecessors, worked entirely from year to year and tended to lay stress on day-to-day repairs and superficial improvements. This new programme provides £48 million in grant over the next ten years. We shall review it from year to year, although knowing the size of the programme at the beginning. The implied average programme of £4·8 million a year will not necessarily be achieved each year, but in 1965–66, the transitional year, we have offered local authorities £4·54 million. I am surprised the hon. Member described that as farcical but of course may be he has a point. If our figure of £4·5 million is farcical, what does he call his own figure last year of £3.95 million or the preceding year of £3·75 million? The hon. Member ought to constrain his criticism if he ignores completely the record of our predecessors.<br><br>
If I may turn to the full programme, all works on roads take time to plan and organise and since responsibility was transferred to the Secretary of State in 1956 there have been almost ten years of planning. At first there was a programme of sorts announced at irregular intervals and for varying periods but in 1960, after about five years of this, our predecessors, I think rightly, decided that a rolling programme covering five years ahead should be adopted. It took them a long time to accept the principle of planning. Indeed 1960–61 is almost a watershed year in Conservative thinking and in their abandonment of rule of thumb methods and acceptance of the principle of planning.<br><br>
Each year the Government review the programme for the next five years and project it one year ahead. This is my difficulty at the moment. The decisions are taken usually in July and are reflected in the White Paper on Public Expenditure published in the autumn. Therefore, on behalf of my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0237">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
Friend, I am somewhat circumscribed in this debate in what I can say. For our part we are determined to drive on with the job of rebuilding Scotland and reshaping its economy. Till decisions are made later in the year, it is right to make sure that the programme of our predecessors is continued and improved upon. I add this proviso however. We are no more impressed with the breadth or depth of their planning in this field than in any other. The programme they announced in 1963 bore the same marks of hasty improvisation as the White Paper on Development and Growth in Central Scotland to which it was linked. We are recasting this roads programme, like the White Paper, to fit into the economic plan against the broader background of Scottish needs as a whole and in the light of studies of the regions outside the central belt about which we are to have a debate later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do appreciate the hon. Gentleman's difficulty, that he has not been able to complete the July review and give it to the Committee, but when he says he is changing the whole policy behind this, surely these new principles he is working on could be given to the Committee so that we could examine them today—not in detail, of how much goes in each direction—but what the new policy is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think one can recite recasting certain principles. I think the hon. Member for Galloway made the point, that we were developing the schemes that were there. I remember when I first came to the House that I found it confusing to find out what was happening to the roads of Scotland with the constant succession of plans which were indefinite. Even with this rolling programme it is not easy to appreciate what is happening. The schemes are those going on building, that is, the schemes there so far as Ministers are concerned not all the paper preparations for schemes. They all depend on money. It is not what we promise to do, but what the Government do that is important. This is the essence. If the party opposite had come back to power in October it is conceivable and possible that they would have slowed down the rate of building in order to save money. Retrenchment has often been Conserva-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
tive policy. That course of action was open to us, but on the contrary we are seeking to fulfil even better the schemes which were on the ground when we arrived in office. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be satisfied if I try to signify the pace at which we are seeking to satisfy his programme and perhaps later on when he sees the White Paper how we are to recast this in specific terms.<br><br>
I was talking about roads and the close connection to economic development. I would have liked to have said a good deal about that in relation to a number of places in Scotland but I want to talk about Glasgow urban roads. It is important to link roads and industry but it is important also that we link roads with city development, and Glasgow, with all respect to Edinburgh, is our greatest city and the one which needs development urgently.<br><br>
I am glad the Secretary of State so recently decided to agree to the first part of the inner ring road. This has long been promised and perhaps illustrates the point I am trying to make that promises are one thing and fulfilling them is another. We have now given sanction to what the right hon. Gentleman arid his hon. Friends opposite have been promising for years. We are also urging Glasgow Corporation to look at the second stage, which is the next stage that Glasgow will wish to carry out—the Carnoustie Street bridge for which they are seeking Parliamentary powers. It is up to Glasgow to go ahead and do its work in that matter.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
We also sanctioned in October money for the work on the southern approaches to the Clyde tunnel. At the same time, the technical details of the scheme for the northern approaches are being worked out. This involves a considerable sum of money and it is not right for right hon. and hon. Members opposite to think that they must have all the credit for the tunnel. A great deal of work remains to be done. The Government have still to complete reviewing the road programme and public investment as a whole, taking into account what the last Government did not do. The full range of the country's needs and the resources available to meet it have to be taken into account.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0238">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
The hon, Gentleman mentioned the Glenfeshie road. I had a most useful meeting recently with Inverness and Aberdeen County Councils, at which the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) and the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) were kind enough to be present. The County Councils, when pressing for the road—quite fairly, they put a time limit—agreed that the road, if it were fitted into the Government's programme to be started within the next two years, would carry 75 per cent. grant. If the road is not put within the programme for the next two years they will want to renegotiate the grant terms. That is a sensible position for them to have taken up. I cannot promise that the road will be in the programme within the next two years; it will cost more than £2 million, but one of the parting gifts of the Highland Panel was a list of new roads suggested by the county councils, including 34 roads at a total cost of about £15 million.<br><br>
Amongst these is the Rannoch Moor—Kingshouse new road which has many supporters and much to be said for it. In the Highlands, too, we ought to find some way of fitting in the Strome Ferry by-pass, about which I met the Ross County Council. Other projects proposed include the by-pass for Conon Bridge, the East Fife regional road costing possibly £6 million to £7 million, and a virtually new road from Grangemouth to the Bathgate—Livingston area. There cannot be room for all of these, and as soon as we have the necessary information we must decide whether the present programme must be adjusted to let some of them in or whether we can afford any as extras. We must, however, also not forget that we have to give some priority among schemes not directly concerned with development and growth to those designed to relieve traffic congestion.<br><br>
Unfortunately there are limits to the amount of this sort of work that any Government can authorise. Local authorities may want to draw up their long-term plans involving vast sums of money in the hope that these will be made available for urban roads within the next ten or twenty years. To be realistic, however, they should first rely on quick results by using existing streets with improvements at bottle necks and difficult junctions. That means that traffic management
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
measures must also be vigorously applied in order to get the best use of the road space which is already there.<br><br>
London is the most striking example of what can be achieved in this way, but there is one notable example in Scotland. Traffic in central Glasgow used to move even more slowly than in central London. The comprehensive scheme of one way working and restrictions on waiting and loading which the Corporation has adopted has raised the mean journey speeds on the roads concerned from 9·8 to 12·4 miles per hour, despite a 10 per cent. increase in traffic. Similar schemes have been introduced experimentally by, for example, Dundee, Airdrie, Hamilton, Kirkcaldy and Stirling. Edinburgh is preparing a scheme of waiting restrictions to be applied to the main radial approaches to the city centre and both Edinburgh and Glasgow, which have already designated street parking places at which charges are made, are considering large extensions to these schemes. We want to see more of this being done and my right hon. Friend will ask that full use is made by the local authorities of highway management techniques before they come to him for grants on schemes of highway improvement in towns.<br><br>
A valuable side effect of more traffic management is likely to be a reduction in road accidents. Two-thirds of our accidents happen on roads subject to a speed limit and a high proportion of them, particularly accidents to pedestians, are due to the presence of parked vehicles in the streets. Cutting down street parking will not only improve traffic circulation and give the bus services a chance, which is highly important, but will save pedestrian lives.<br><br>
The subject of road safety will be in the minds of many hon. Members, particularly after the grave accident figures at Easter. Last year was a bad year. Casualties in Scotland totalled 30,527, an increase of 10·9 per cent. over the previous year. The number of people killed, 754, was 42 more than during 1963. Unhappily, this was in line with the trend for Great Britain as a whole. The increase in road deaths affected nearly all classes of road users except motor scooter riders and car drivers.<br><br>
What are we doing about this? Much more than appears on the face of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
Estimate. First, there are all the varied activities of local authorities through their road safety committees and with the very active support of the police in education and training, local road safety campaigns, dipped headlight campaigns and so on. These are assisted by the Exchequer through the general grant. Then there is the contribution of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, working closely with the local authorities as the Government's main agent in road safety propaganda. It receives a direct grant from the Minister of Transport on behalf of all three roads Ministers, as well as the grant borne by the Scottish Roads Vote which meets the administrative cost of the Society's organisation in Scotland.<br><br>
Hon. Members will recall that the Government sponsored, at the end of last year, an intensive and costly publicity campaign on the theme "Don't ask a man to drink and drive". How far this succeeded in its aim of changing public attitudes and whether it is worth repeating we should be able to judge when we have seen the Road Research Laboratory's report on Christmas accidents.<br><br>
Apart from education and propaganda, my right hon. Friend's main responsibilities in road safety are for speed limits and pedestrian crossings. We have had some criticism of the speed limit policy. This year we are continuing and extending the experiment begun last year with weekend 50 mile per hour limits between the beginning of July and the end of September. There was a fall last year in injury accidents on the 50 m.ph. lengths while there was a rise on other trunk roads, but the improvement was not evenly spread over the experimental mileage, so we are continuing experimenting this year on a bigger mileage—126 as against 81 last year—to see if more conclusive results can be obtained before we consider making any of the limits permanent.<br><br>
There has been some criticism of this experiment by drivers who think that they are so good that no restrictions should ever apply to them. This attitude is selfish and foolish. The limits are being tried in the majority interest, at weekends only—when there are a lot of less experienced drivers on the road—and only on roads
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
where the police judge speed to be a factor in a high proportion of accidents.<br><br>
Last year, on 81 miles of speed limited roads at 13 summer weekends, there were 13 fewer accidents than the year before. Deaths were cut by four, serious injuries by seven, and slight injuries by 25. We have to find out whether these results were a fluke or whether, as experience all over the world suggests, we can count on an accident saving of this order to justify the restraint on drivers and the extra patrolling which the police forces concerned have to do to enforce the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend taken into account the possibility of restraining drivers by fitting a mechanical restraint to the car engines of those who have had one or two or three accidents and by this means diminishing their speed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not considered that although I have heard it suggested. The National Road Safety Advisory Council is ideally fitted to make that kind of assessment. In this Committee we are lucky in having my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele) who is a member of the Council, so my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) has direct access to the Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt, but does my hon. Friend realise that I have brought this matter to the notice of the Minister of Transport, and that he replied that it was mechanically impossible? That is entirely wrong. I have authority for saying that it is mechanically possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to the Under-Secretary that there should be some form of mechanical restraint upon the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the female equivalent of "ungallant" but I think that that intervention by the hon. Lady was ungallant.<br><br>
There is also, of course—and both sides will welcome this—the presence of Jim Clark, our Scottish world champion driver, on the Advisory Council. I think that we are all very glad of the Scottish contribution to the Advisory Council.<br><br>

Of the programmes on the ground when we took office, we are going ahead as fast as we can to try to get them completed. In autumn this year, we shall see the completion of the Bonnybridge by-pass and the western end of the Harthill by-pass motorway; of two schemes totalling 10 miles on the trunk road to Kyle and of the crofter county schemes in Glenkinglas, in Argyll, and Corriehallie, in Ross-shire—another eight miles.<br><br>
Next spring we should complete the 5½mile scheme south of Ecclefechan on the A.74, the Chapelhill diversion on the A1 and the Loch Ainort scheme in Skye. Next summer will come the Tay road bridge and next autumn and winter the six miles of the A74 from Beattock up to the Lanark county boundary and the nine-mile first stage of the Hamilton by-pass motorway. So much for what we were left with.<br><br>
Starts this year are on a bigger scale than completions. Counting trunk road schemes alone, between now and the end of the financial year, we expect to start about 19 miles of motorway, six miles of dual carriageway and 10 miles of Highland trunk road reconstruction. The motorway schemes are the Harthill to Newhouse section of the A8, on which work is just beginning; the second stage of the Hamilton by-pass which is out to tender; and the Renfrew and Polmont by-passes for which the order procedures have still to be completed. This is a matter we are actively considering and I am also in close conversations with the Joint Erskine Bridge Committee of the Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire County Councils and I hope we shall be able to make an announcement later.<br><br>
Major classified schemes which will be starting include the Clyde tunnel south approach and Townhead interchange in Glasgow, large schemes on the A8 in Port Glasgow and the A735 in Coatbridge, the Highland new road schemes at Ormidale, in Argyll, and Trondra, in Zetland, and two large schemes in Cumbernauld new town and about 30 miles of crofter county schemes in the North-West.<br><br>
This is not bad for a Government only eight months in power. The Committee can rely on the fact that, in next year's Estimate, we shall have much better results to report and certainly much better than our predecessors.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. hon. Friend sits down, could he answer about tolls? He was asked specifically by the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) when he would make a statement on them. We in Fife feel strong about this. If he omits this from his speech, as he has done, it might be misinterpreted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend, but it was my intention to omit it, because I had about 24 pages of notes still to deliver had I had the time. My hon. Friend is quite right. He has never taken the same viewpoint on this as the majority of his party and certainly as the party manifesto. We did not, in the manifesto, agree precisely with his attitude, although I respect his view. The attitude of the Labour Party is that we dislike tolls and must ensure that they do not inhibit economic development. We said in the manifesto that if it was clear that there was any such inhibition—not necessarily a decrease—we would look at the question. The experience in Fife is the reverse, however. Far from the case of the bridge stopping industry, industry is sweeping into Fife on a remarkable scale. The Government's policy was explained clearly by the Minister of Transport in reply to the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Marten) on 8th December. My right hon. Friend said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My policy is that tolls should be charged on expensive new river crossings, such as the Severn Bridge, which will provide expectional savings in cost and time to a clearly defined category of road users."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th December, 1964; Vol. 703, c. 186.]</p></blockquote></span></p>

In that he is following exactly the advice given in this Committee and to the House of Commons by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) when he was Secretary of State for Scotland. Speaking as a Fifer and, the same as the hon.

have from the beginning of the week to the end—getting across the bridge with my motor car and any number of passengers for 2s. 6d., compared with what used to be the position with the ferry, when the charge was 6s. or 7s. with an extra charge for passengers, and the delays which occurred—and the possibility that sometimes one could not get on to the ferry.<br><br>
May I now turn to my own constituency? Although the subject I shall discuss is largely a constituency matter, I think it also important to Scotland as a whole. I should like to devote my remarks to the A1 road which goes south through East Lothian and then to Berwickshire. The A1 road has a tremendous prestige. It is not only the main road from Edinburgh to London, I should call it the main road from Scotland to England. I wish to direct the attention of the Under-Secretary of State to this matter. I am sure he will appreciate how much attention it deserves.<br><br>
I should like to say how grateful I am to the Minister for having come to see the road on the eighteenth of last month, when I had the pleasure of welcoming him there. I must not go too far. Were I to say that his visit made up for the failure of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to come at an earlier date I should be misleading the Committee, because my constituents have, for a long time been looking forward to a visit from the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If you will allow me, Mr. McInnes, to quote a little. I should like to quote from verses written by one of my constituents who, I may say, is descended from Robert Louis Stevenson. He has put into verse some of his thoughts upon the subject of the Secretary of State and the attention paid to East Lothian. I will start with the first two lines, in order to start the thing off, and resume at a later point:

<br><blockquote><p>'The road improved before for me.'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Why should the Secretary of State</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Come to Dunbar a'tempting fate?"</p></blockquote>
I am very glad that the Under-Secretary of State did come to Dunbar. He did not risk his neck in my poor motor car but was kind enough to invite me to the safety of his official vehicle, and we drove down the Dunbar by-pass. Really, it is a shocking road to be part of the A.1 between Edinburgh and London. It is very narrow, tortuous and twisty all the time and has more than one crossroad—as I think my hon. Friend has had occasion to know before now. There is a double white line on the road and one cannot overtake another vehicle. If in the summer traffic one is behind a slow moving vehicle, a long queue is formed.<br><br>
This is not a local problem. I ask the Committee to believe that it has its effect on the tourist traffic in Scotland. Tourists go where the roads are good. They do not want to drive behind a caravan and so they turn to go by a different road and so this important part of south-east Scotland is squeezed out of their route. There is a good deal of heavy traffic that I should like to see directed to the east of Scotland but it is switched to the west. Dr. Beeching threatened to downgrade the railways between Newcastle and Edinburgh and it is important that we should have good road communications. I listened with attention to what the Under-Secretary was saying and I hope that the National Economic Planning Council will look after the interests of south-east Scotland.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
I know that the Committee will appreciate how vital it is that the road is of a good quality and able to cater for all the business and tourist traffic coming that way. It is not only at Dunbar that we want a by-pass. As the Minister said, we also require a by-pass at the town of Tranent where the street is very narrow and the traffic is busy. The road there is unsuitable for the volume of traffic which uses it.<br><br>
The hasty catalogue given by the Under-Secretary of State of the many completions of roads included the important Chapelhill diversion on the A1. That was due to the work which was started under the previous Administration—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Anstruther-Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—for which my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and the then Under-Secretary of State must have the credit.<br><br>
Among the starts on new roads I did not hear mention of the A.1. I may have missed it and I shall have to read the OFFICIAL REPORT tomorrow. I was bitterly disappointed not to hear it, especially after the Minister was so kind during our conversation in Scotland a fortnight ago.<br><br>
I come on further south—still on the A.1—to Berwickshire. A great deal has been done there. The Chapelhill diversion has already been mentioned and much was done at Grantshouse by the previous Administration. I have a specific question to put to the Under-Secretary of State. After seeing me he went south to meet the convener of the Berwickshire County Council. I should be flattering the Minister if I read out the personal comments of the convener about how happy he was to meet the Minister. The convener wrote to me and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I asked Dr. Mabon—if he could sanction the starting of road improvements near Renton on the A.1 road. It is about two miles of twists and turns. We"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the county council—
<br><blockquote><p>"own nearly all the land, about 85 per cent., that is affected. It would cost £165,000 and we are raring to go. All plans are ready. He told me to forward the facts to him and he would see what could be done. Can you encourage him? Please make him say, 'Yes'."</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
The convener overrates my influence with the Secretary of State, but if it is a help to the Minister I think that I could put an absolutely cast-iron case to him that when making plans for finances in July—after all, that is this month—there is a really strong argument to justify the inclusion of the expenditure of £165,000 on this road.<br><br>
There are other hon. Members who wish to speak, so let me not delay the Committee longer, except to echo the words of appreciation expressed by the Minister that Jim Clark, the great racing motorist, has been able to join the Safety Council. Jim Clark, as hon. Members may know, is a constituent of mine. It is hard to think of a constituent of whom one could be more proud. I may add that his father had a farm at my home at Wester Kilmany. Jim Clark was born within a quarter of a mile of my own house and lived for the first 20 years of his life there. If anyone would like to say a word of appreciation of Jim Clark no one could be more delighted to do so than the Member for Berwick and East Lothian.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that I should follow the right hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) in view of his concluding remarks and the tribute he paid to Jim Clark: he will know that the person coming second to Jim Clark is Jackie Stewart, and he is a constituent of mine.<br><br>
I am tempted to follow many of the remarks which have been made this morning particularly those made by the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) who quickly left the roads and went on to the rail, and his challenge about tolls. I have come to realise that the choice lying with local authorities is either to have a bridge with tolls or no bridge at all. Experience throughout the world today is that it is either a bridge with tolls or no bridge at all. I should not like to get into the same position as the people of Fife, who clamoured for the Forth Road Bridge and agreed to tolls and then, having got the bridge, they bring deputations to try to get rid of the tolls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot allow this. The economic circumstances
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
in 1947 when Fife county agreed to that were entirely different from what they are now. Does not my hon. Friend recognise the complete inconsistency of Government policy? There is a bridge in the Cromwell Road on the way to London Airport: it is a bridge though it crosses land instead of water. No suggestion of a toll is made in respect of that bridge. It is this complete inconsistency which I find incomprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not enter into an argument about this matter. I said that the experience of the world is that one has a bridge with tolls or no bridge and that is the choice we have to make.<br><br>
I wish to make my position clear. I think it would be unfair to ask the rate payers of Cumbernauld to pay Is. in the £ in their rates for a bridge over the Clyde—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I must get on with my speech, because there are other hon. Members who wish to speak, and I must make my remarks as short as possible.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend said it was difficult to measure progress with regard to roads, and I could not agree more. In previous speeches in this Committee I have tried certain exercises in an attempt to find out exactly how one could measure this particular progress. In my first exercise I took as my text "promise and performance", and here I looked at the Government's programme, took the starting dates which had been given and the dates when it was expected that the job would be completed, and I found over the year that the starting dates were gradually pushed back and also the dates when the job was expected to be finished. So I found there was a great deal of delay and I must confess I was much amazed at the remarks of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Galloway when he spoke about the wonderful progress on the A.74. He does not know that I have a letter on my file which I treasure—</span></p>
<p>The CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that 17 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room, and 17 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I was rather amazed at the remarks of the hon. Member for Galloway about the progress on the A.74 because I have a letter in my file which I treasure, which I got from the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1945 and in which he indicated that there would be a lovely four lane highway between Uddingston and the English border in 10 years' time. That is now, 1965, so we are just about five years behind on that particular issue.<br><br>
The other exercise which I did was rather more involved. I took the actual amount of the estimate each year and then later on I took the accounts to find out how much had actually been spent. Here again I found that expectation and realisation were two entirely different things. However I gather this has been improved over the years and I would like my hon. Friend to give us some indication as to whether in fact the amount that is estimated is actually spent, because clearly the Committee will recognise that when we give an estimate of the amount to be spent in each particular year and that amount is not spent then obviously the work has fallen behind.<br><br>
Another exercise which I undertook in this Committee was to compare the time taken on similar contracts in England and Wales as compared with Scotland, and much to my surprise I found that major contracts in the South were in fact being carried out much more speedily than they were in Scotland. It may be that the situation here has improved, but I would like to know from my hon. Friend whether in respect of present contracts as compared with what is being done in the South the general performance is reasonable and adequate. It is true, and I think we all recognise it, that there is only a certain amount of money available, and therefore the real problem which my hon. Friend has to face is the question of priority and the principles upon which he is going to decide which job shall be done.<br><br>
My own view on the priority system is that the Erskine bridge should have been in the plan before the Tay road bridge. I believe all the estimates and all the calculations and the traffic census would show that this is reasonable. Quite frankly, I do not want to enter into arguments with my hon. Friends from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
Fife again but I think this should have been done.<br><br>
On this question of priority I discovered that there was in the programme a two mile diversion on the A.814 at Faslane. I realise that this appeared in the programme not because the present road at this point was inadequate—in fact this particular road is the straightest and the widest part of the road between Helensburgh and Arrochar. Therefore it was not a question of the road itself being inadequate, but, of course, the reason for this two-mile diversion is that the Government decided to have the Polaris base in Faslane and this particular section of road will be enclosed within the security arrangements at that point. I would like to know whether in fact anything more is going to be done there.<br><br>
Let us consider for a moment what has happened to this once quiet, peaceful and restful area. First of all there is the B.P. deep water oil terminal, and we have Metal Industries Limited at Faslane, but may I say these people are not the worst offenders, because the real problem in the Gareloch and around this area is the intrusion of Government Departments. We have the Army training ground, where we have tanks and troop manœuvres; we have the Post Office with a cable station for the loading of the deep sea cables, and then we have the Ministry of Fuel and Power with the oil terminal and storage depot. We also have a large N.A.T.O. base in this area. We have the Third Submarine Squadron with all that is associated with it. And now, of course, we have the new Polaris base, in which we are going to have offices, schools, housing estates, and so on. Yet the road to Faslane and Garelochhead is still this narrow winding road from Dumbarton through Helensburgh and up the side of the Gareloch. Even at the moment, as the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), who, I understand, has to travel this road pretty frequently, would agree this road is overloaded, and the traffic census which I see in the Appendix to this Report indicates that. I would like to know what plans the Government have and what priority is being given because of the new developments which will take place there.<br><br>
Associated with this is the first stage of the Alexandria by-pass, which was not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
included in the comments of my hon. Friend this morning. Before anything can be done on the Dumbarton-Helensburgh-Garelochhead road we must have the first stage of the Alexandria by-pass complete. The Report, at page 58, paragraph 3, deals with the difficulties which have to be faced before we get to this particular stage, but I find the Alexandria by-pass is still in paragraph 4. Therefore it is a long way from being completed. I would say to my hon. Friend that this is not very encouraging. One reads in paragraph 3:
<br><blockquote><p>"These consultations may take many months."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5 says that
<br><blockquote><p>"negotiations … may take many months".</p></blockquote>
There is a long list of problems in paragraph 8. In paragraph 9 it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Land acquisition can only be started when the design of a new road is far enough advanced to determine the limits of land which must be acquired."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 11 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tenders are sought when it is reasonably certain that entry can be obtained."</p></blockquote>
This is all very disappointing, because I devoted a whole speech one morning on a roads debate to this particular problem, in which I said quite frankly that all these delays associated with the acquiring of land and the fact that one could not do one thing before another step had been undertaken, and one could not acquire the land before certain other formalities had been observed, and one could not invite tenders until the line was decided upon. I said that any Government had to look seriously at this aspect of the matter. But I also said that if in fact nothing could be done then it was quite clear that we had to have more forward planning and we had to reach the stage when all these things could be done ahead to ensure that the work would be carried out. Therefore the first Report coming from my hon. Friend containing this long list of problems is in fact disappointing. I would rather have had something to tell us how the problems were going to be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say in defence that it is always a good doctor's exercise to give the diagnosis first of all, before prescribing treatment?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steele</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid my disappointment is that I gave the diagnosis in a speech some considerable time ago.<br><br>
Anyhow it is clear that something must be done about this, and I am happy in the thought that my hon. Friend has still to make his decisions; that we can make our case clear this morning and the decisions will be made in July.<br><br>
I hope my hon. Friend will have a look at this particular problem with regard to the by-pass of the road up to Garelochhead because with the increasing tourist traffic and the industrial traffic it is essential that we should do a little forward planning. When the new bridge at Erskine has been completed and attracts the traffic from the west side, this particular road is going to be a real problem. Therefore I would like to have an assurance that this matter is being looked at with a view to forward planning.<br><br>
Associated with the Alexandria by-pass is the problem of the Strathleven industrial estate. For many years we have had serious complaints about the lack of bus services to this particular estate. At the present time the bus company refuses to take the services into the estate because of the dangerous condition of the access. I understand that the authorities concerned are considering an interim arrangement which will cost about £12,000 for a new access which would enable a bus service to be available to the people on the estate, and I trust my hon. Friend will give sympathetic consideration to this being done.<br><br>
Finally, may I say that I took the opportunity to read a speech which I made in the House in 1954 and it sounds better today than it did then, but one of the points which I made will be of interest to you, Mr. McInnes, because I drew attention to the fact that the Ministry of Transport had planned and built the continuation of the Alexandria Parade road, the A8, as a very fine four-lane highway to get away from all the development and to enable motorists and others to use this road with freedom.<br><br>
I said at the time that I was very much afraid that the planning people in Glasgow would use this splendid highway as a street, and this is what has happened. Over the years, they have had to impose a 30 m.p.h. speed limit on it. Many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
accidents have occurred. The development should have been planned with other arterial roads to serve the housing estates on either side.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
We need to have a lot more planning of what has to be done. With the building of the Erskine bridge, I envisage a lot of new developments. I believe that the Paisley "buddies," the Greenock people, and all on that side, will use the Erskine bridge to get to Stirling and the north, because this would be more convenient than going through Glasgow. I also see that the West people when going south will use this road to get on to the A.74. We should, therefore, be considering with the Erskine bridge, the problems of Paisley and the new road from there to help my hon. Friend's constituency of Greenock through to the A.74, which is the main artery to the South, irrespective of the remarks of the right hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray). I hope, therefore, that the Department will consider this. If it does not do it now, all the local authorities in the area are going ahead with their housing schemes and other developments and a line will be much more difficult and expensive the longer we put it off. I hope that we may get from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary an indication that this kind of forward planning is in his mind and particularly the new four-lane highway which I should like to see from Erskine bridge right through to the A.74.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like, first, to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) on his opening speech, his first from the Front Bench. We listened to him with interest and we look forward to hearing him often again.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister that the Estimates for next year are up by £5½ million. I have no objection to this provided that the Government are satisfied that it is not overstraining the economy. There are so many things we want to do, including education, that we must have priorities. I wonder whether the Under-Secretary can tell us that these priorities are being worked out and that a careful watch is being kept on our resources, because we have to remember the taxpayer, whether as a company, an organisation or an individual.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
I do a certain amount of motoring in Scotland and in the Whitsun Recess I went to the north, up the east coast and down the west. It is only fair to congratulate the former Secretary of State Lord Muirshiel and his successor my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) on the programmes which they initiated and completed. I do not want to inject a party note. I wish the Government well in their programme, which appears to me to be reasonable.<br><br>
I thought that the road, certainly from Inverness, Wick and beyond, was good, and there was an impressive road from Ledmore to Ullapool and from Ledmore to Kylesku. These deserve a certain amount of praise. I am not sure that we advertise these achievements sufficiently. Certainly driving on those roads is paradise compared with motoring on some of the English roads, especially in respect of surface, scenery and congestion.<br><br>
In the programme which the Government are carrying on, could they please press to complete the Edinburgh-Glasgow road? This is extremely important. It is a major highway but it is still unsatisfactory in a number of places which I will not enumerate. From the viewpoint of tourism and of Highland development, what is the possibility of giving attention to the roads around Bettyhill, which are not much good, and to the stretch from Ullapool southwards?<br><br>
I do not want to make a party speech—I know that other hon. Members wish to take part in the debate—but I should like the Under-Secretary to answer certain questions. In page 74, item D, of the Estimates, there is an item of "Equipment". What exactly does this comprise? When tenders for roads are put out, to what extent does the Scottish Office require the contractor to use British-made equipment or better still, Scottish-made equipment? If something could be done along these lines, it would be a good way of helping Scottish firms.<br><br>
On the question of road safety, which the Under-Secretary mentioned, does Scotland make any special effort on its own or does it work entirely with the Ministry of Transport? What information, advice or tips can be picked up from American or Continental experience? If we could make Scottish roads accident-free, it would certainly be a tremendous feather in our cap.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
This next item is only a small one, but on page 75 of the Estimates, under "Miscellaneous Services", there is an item of "War terminal expenses" of £150. I am not trying to catch out the Minister, nor do I require the answer this morning, but this is a curiosity and I should like to know what it is.<br><br>
My last point concerns traffic in Edinburgh. Anybody who knows that city will have marked the tremendous increase over the last few years. My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway touched upon this. If the Hall Report proves to be correct and traffic doubles by 1970, the position will be serious indeed. I welcome the Forth Road Bridge, of course, but it is increasing the traffic in and around Edinburgh. The Secretary of State has told me that his office will help the Edinburgh authorities on any traffic problems, but may I be told what decisions have been reached or what discussions have taken place? What exactly is happening, if anything, about ring road? It is extremely difficult to find out. I should like some advice about this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member agree that at present the ring route, so-called, is neither a ring nor a route?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is pretty deplorable and we will need one. I should like to know what is proposed.<br><br>
In the studies of Edinburgh traffic, may I once more make a plea that we do not overlook the suburban railways. In America, suburban railways are being brought back to relieve traffic congestion in cities, and in Toronto new lines are being established. Edinburgh has suburban railways. I do not mind if the Caledonian station is reduced in size, but it would be crazy to do away with it entirely, as it is well placed centrally.<br><br>
It is a tremendous asset and we shall need it in the future. What is happening here, and what discussions is the Minister having with the Edinburgh authorities and with his right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) in what he said about not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
neglecting the suburban railways. In Glasgow, we are following that policy with success, and also with profit to British Railways, because now that diesel traction has been introduced and travelling facilities for passengers have been improved, the attraction to the travelling public has been immensely increased and people have responded. Suburban trains in Glasgow, particularly in the morning, mid-afternoon and evening, are very well patronised.<br><br>
I offer my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary my congratulations on the speech which he has just made. I was interested particularly in two points which he dealt with, but I liked the comprehensive nature of his speech and the general plan for Scotland which he outlined, particularly concerning the Highlands. We have just finished the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill. We all recognise that if the new industrial outlook that we want to see in the Highlands is successful, a modern road scheme is essential to the success of the industrial future of the Highlands.<br><br>
This morning, to temper the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis), I extracted from the Kilbrandon Report, which the hon. Member seemed to have forgotten, this quotation drawing attention to the fact that
<br><blockquote><p>"trunk roads stop short at the mainland shore. If it is accepted that road transport is to develop and particularly if road and ferry are to become the normal means of access to the Outer Hebrides, then it would appear logical and appropriate that certain of the major islands should be included in the trunk road system."</p></blockquote>
During all the period when the Tories were in power, 1 never at any time heard the hon. Member for Galloway putting forward that suggestion.<br><br>
Again, the Kilbrandon Report tells us:
<br><blockquote><p>"It cannot be too frequently stated that if the Highland road system is to catch up with the development of road transport, and still more if road transport has to expand to fill the vacuum left by any contraction of rail transport, then substantial capital expenditure is needed on these main roads and at a much higher rate of progress and investment than is contemplated at the moment."</p></blockquote>
That moment was in 1962–63. Therefore, that quotation somewhat subtracts from the opening speech by the hon. Member for Galloway in that he failed to recognise the failure of the Tory Party when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0248">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
in power to meet the needs of Highland transport; and to stand the condemnation which is inherent in that criticism from the Kilbrandon Report that the Tory Government were not even thinking of increasing the amount that they were spending in the Highlands as late as 1963.<br><br>
I was attracted, as all hon. Members were, particularly to what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said about accidents and road safety. While I did not gather the full import of the intervention by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes), I was reminded when he was speaking of a development in air travel that we long argued about whereby it was advocated that every aircraft should carry a great parachute on top of it, so that in the event of difficulty and a sharp and unexpected descent, the parachute would open and everybody would land nicely and easily.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Listening to my hon. Friend, I thought it might be similarly applied to the motor car so that every car would have attached to it a parachute at the back. That parachute would open at certain speeds and the greater the speed became, the wider the parachute would open and so retard this type of driver who paid no respect to road safety. I do not know whether or not it was Heath Robinson who patented the idea, but evidently industrialists were not impressed and it has never been taken up.<br><br>
Nevertheless, one cannot look lightly on the behaviour of drivers on the roads today. The individual with a car is controlling a loaded weapon. And if anyone destroys human life with a loaded weapon then he is held up for charge. Whether the loaded weapon is a revolver or a car, we cannot dissociate them in their equally disastrous effects.<br><br>
I know one part of the road south of Glasgow very well. Every Saturday afternoon there goes up on that road from Glasgow to Kilmarnock in great letters "50", both ways, and I sit in a car using that road and with "50" in front of us cars regularly overtake. They must be doing 60 and 70 miles per hour with the "50" staring them in the face; but apparently ignoring the warning sign for their own safety and the safety of other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
road users. The sooner we get down to putting on the roads of Scotland a mobile motor force—I will not call it a police force—that will patrol our roads regularly, particularly trunk roads and charge those who violate the safety regulations that the Minister imposes for the benefit of traffic or other road users, and deal with them on the spot, the better. If their crimes became too frequent then the issue of debarring some of them from the roads must be faced.<br><br>
I am not ignoring the fact that other road users, like those who progress on their feet, have also to respect the laws of the road. I see in Glasgow people using road crossings to which they have the right of access, but everyone who uses a road crossing ought to use it at the appropriate time. He ought not to step off the pavement suddenly without giving warning to approaching drivers that he is about to use the crossing so that they may have some idea of what his intentions are.<br><br>
I offer my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State my congratulations on his speech. I have here the Estimates and in Appendix I I am told in the "schemes in progress" include the M.8 motorway from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Is this something new? Because it is not so long ago that I travelled on the road from Edinburgh to Glasgow and it was not a motorway? It does not look as if there is space available to build a motorway. It may be some new scheme has been started between Glasgow and Edinburgh which I have not been told about. There is not the space for a motorway in the sense that we understand the letter "M" and see it employed in England. Perhaps my hon. Friend could tell me whether this is a motorway. I want to endorse the point made by my hon. Friend and reiterated by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele). Both referred to the fact that here is a difference between estimated expenditure and actual expenditure. An example is provided by this scheme where the current estimated cost is £2,334,000 and probable expenditure, we do not know if it is actual at the moment, is £1,410,000. One could give many examples of that.<br><br>
I am sorry the hon. Member for Galloway is no longer with us because I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
wanted to direct his attention to one or two things he said. He took immense credit for what the Tory Party, when in power, had done for roads. According to Appendix I taking the period 1962–65 for new construction and major improvements the previous Government authorised two schemes of motorway construction. Since they came to power, the Labour Government have authorised three schemes. That is in the Estimates Report. In the last three years of Tory power they authorised two schemes and the Labour Government in the short period of nine months have authorised three motorway schemes and the record on trunk roads is much the same. I would congratulate the hon. Member for Galloway if he had still been here. I hope my congratulations will be conveyed to him through the appropriate channels of the party opposite.<br><br>
He referred to, and I welcome his interest in Glasgow, the Whiteinch Tunnel, commonly known as the Linthouse Tunnel. To save any argument and to satisfy honour on both sides of the river, we sometimes call it the Whiteinch-Linthouse Tunnel. I think the hon. Member for Govan was the first Member to raise this, way back in 1950. The Tory Party came to power in 1951 and in spite of six years of continued pressure on the Tory Government to go ahead with this scheme, it was 1957 before the preliminary steps were taken to proceed with Linthouse Tunnel. That was a long period of pressure for something that was of such importance to Govan, particularly because of the number of road accidents taking place in Paisley Road and Govan Road through the immense amount of traffic passing through to George Fifth bridge. That is why I follow my hon. Friend for Dunbartonshire, West in suggesting that Erskine Road bridge was a priority necessity in Glasgow. There is no doubt but that the Linthouse Tunnel has absorbed an immense amount of traffic, but the general increase in traffic between 1950 and 1965 has been so heavy that the two streets which I have named in my division are still too crowded. I believe that if the Erskine Road bridge had been given the priority from the western Scotland point of view that it should have had, then that would have been a contribution to lessening
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
the danger of accidents in the southern part of Glasgow.<br><br>
I now want to refer to the Carnoustie Street bridge and the inner ring road. Anyone who knows Glasgow realises it is very nice to talk about doing these things. The Whiteinch-Linthouse Tunnel is not just a case of making a tunnel. It involves a housing problem in addition. At the moment the housing problem associated with the approaches to Linthouse is still troubling the Corporation, and the same is true of the Carnoustie Street bridge; and the inner ring road. In the part of my division that covers these two the housing problem involved is serious.<br><br>
I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) because I have a C.O.I, engagement today and must go immediately as I am welcoming some people from abroad. So I hope he will forgive me if I read his speech tomorrow in the OFFICIAL REPORT. In view of these things I will cut short the other half of what I intended to say and give way to what I hope will be the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston).<br><br>
12.30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start my remarks—although like everybody in the Committee I could talk a great deal longer on this subject than we have time to do today—by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) on the very good start which he made in speaking from the Front Bench.<br><br>
I should also like to congratulate the Scottish Development Department on the excellence of the Report it has produced and the attractive layout. We can congratulate the Scottish Departments as a whole on the way in which they produced their Reports. Of course, they have some rather attractive things to say this year, which, perhaps, helped.<br><br>
I would apologise to the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) because he got squeezed out of the debate, but I cannot feel I can congratulate him, because, after the considerable fuss his party has been making about these Committees, none of them had the courtesy to come in for the opening speech, and then to expect to speak in the debate is something which we do not normally expect in this Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I cannot give way at the moment. I may give way later at some point.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State presented a number of problems fairly and clearly, and I should like to pick up some of them and perhaps develop one or two in the few moments I have. But, quite honestly, I find it a little nauseating, slightly boring, when hon. Members opposite—and the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) was just as much at fault as the Under-Secretary of State—say at one and at the same time that of course they had a most appalling mess left to them in Scotland—something which neither I myself, nor, I believe, the Scottish people, accept—and claim wonderful progress during their eight months in power, when as the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele) explained very clearly, every single one—every single one—of the roads claimed by the Under-Secretary of State as being part of the eight-month programme was planned or started by us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read out a list—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Starts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Starts—and if he will check he will find that every single one of them was started or planned during our time in office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the right hon. Gentleman will give way now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry. I have not much time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Half an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not half an hour. Unlike the hon. Member for Govan, who overran his time, I shall try to give the Under-Secretary of State a full opportunity to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the right hon. Gentleman does not give way the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) cannot remain on his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly trying to make a party point, but it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
wrong to talk about nothing having been done and then claim the credit in these eight months for things which were organised and planned or in most cases actually started under the previous Administration.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway said, obviously we have to think of our road programmes in terms of the development of the areas concerned. Hon. Members have spoken today about the great projects which have been started or completed in the last year or two—the Forth and Tay bridges and the Clyde tunnel, for instance. Hon. Members have expressed doubts, perhaps quite natural doubts, as to whether these were the most important things. If we were looking back at it now, I think that perhaps the tunnel, which has been extremely useful to Glasgow, was perhaps a good deal more expensive than expected and perhaps not the ideal thing to do. It is possible that, if the Erskine road bridge was ready when the Tay road bridge was ready to start, it might well have been that that would have got the benefit because it was ready. These are problems which the Under-Secretary of State will find arising in his time, too.<br><br>
Purely for my own interest, I would ask him to tell us how the traffic across the Forth Road Bridge is going. I know that the Department in my time made an estimate of what it thought the traffic would be and we were told pretty bluntly by other traffic experts that we were wrong. I should be interested to know the result.<br><br>
It is true that, as the years progress, we have to use our road programme as a most important part of the whole development of the country and this inevitably means—and it brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Govan—that from time to time the Government of the day must make up their mind as to the priorities needed at any particular moment. Therefore, I accepted—as Member for a Highland constituency I regretted it very much—and agreed to the policy which my predecessor started in 1960–61—I think it was—of deliberately spending more of the available money and resources on building up the infrastructure of central Scotland, because that is the heart of Scotland. As money is not unlimited
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
I thought he was right in that case to do it.<br><br>
I am certain that the Under-Secretary of State has it in mind that one of the important things in the development of Scotland over the next decade will be the use, and ease of access to and egress from, our ports. Now we are building this new port at Leith, developing it for big deep-water operation. I hope that some of the new thinking which is going on on the Clyde may develop. The hon. Gentleman himself represents an area with considerable port interests and he will, of course, judge between these projects entirely impartially—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—although, as he said, some have natural advantages.<br><br>
This is a serious point. In the South very often the ports are themselves not perhaps very up to date but the real trouble is access to them. I hope very much that in our thinking about how we are to spend what is always a limited amount of money on our road development, these other important items will not be overlooked.<br><br>
Then there is the wider problem of the Highland roads—wider and sometimes wilder—and I understand the hon. Gentleman's pleasure at his trips to the Highlands to look at the problems: it is good exercise during the Recesses. We have here a very distinct problem—it was there in my time in office and it is there still today—of how to reinforce the roads over which the timber to the pulp mill goes.<br><br>
These roads are to some extent, often in outlying places. Many of them are not only too narrow but in addition have an inadequate bottom to them to carry the heavy loads which are the only economic ones for getting the timber to the pulp mill. I know that these schemes were started last year and we have made a beginning on them, but I would make this plea which I think a fair one. As these programmes are built up, they will put a considerable burden on the counties involved. My own county, I know, is expecting to have to spend a great deal of money for this purpose and that this will rise steeply through the years.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
The County of Inverness will also have fairly heavy expenditure but will have the benefit of the much increased rating which the pulp mill and the housing and so on will bring. I hope that the Government will look at the problem, and if it is bringing undue hardship on any areas, will take some steps to try to help them.<br><br>
I would like to say a word about the Glenfeshie road. I think this may be the time when it ought to come into the programme. A few years ago it had no particular attraction apart from just opening up a new track. At the moment, however, it is linking up big tourist developments—in Aviemore area—and also providing an access road to the pulp mill, so that it is fitting in with the main aspects of Highland development.<br><br>
The last thing I would say specifically about Highland roads is that, whether we like it or not, we have got to accept that, for a number of years ahead, we shall continue to have long stretches of road of single track. It may be that one of the solutions to the problem of such roads—generally acute only for a month or two in the year—is to enlarge the conception of the passing passes into passing lanes in some places—say for half a mile, or whatever would be the appropriate length—so that there is a bit of double-track road which would avoid a build-up of traffic behind big lorries, perhaps carrying very important things like timber, fish and so on and people would not suffer so much frustration.<br><br>
The debate has been very interesting from the point of view of our thinking about these problems. I wonder sometimes whether we do in certain areas of Scotland spend too much on roads. That may be a rather odd thought to put in a debate in which almost everyone is asking for more, but I was impressed and very much interested by the description which the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West gave to the Committee, particularly because I know most of the things which he talked about The hon. Member described his constituency and said Government Departments were the worst offenders, because they had brought a great many new things into his area and, of course, the roads—I do not entirely disagree with him—are not yet ready to carry all this new development.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
This is a typical example of the way the Government have spent money—in his case, a very great deal—to bring industry into an area and then the roads have to be improved afterwards. I am sometimes worried whether we spend too much money on putting roads into some of the Highland areas and not enough on getting people there first. I know that one can argue the chicken and the egg, but I hope that the Highland Transport Board and the new Highland Development Board will look at this problem carefully because money is limited and it is sometimes best to get the jobs first and the roads afterwards.<br><br>
If the Committee wants a good example of this, a quick look at the position in the Faroe Islands is enlightening. There they spend practically nothing on roads—of course, they have the sea around them—and they are one of the few areas which have really developed because all the money has gone on this type of thinking. We must not compare unlike with unlike, but there is a thought there which I think we should ponder.<br><br>
Assuming that we get so much money, are we spending it in the right way? The hon. Member compared contract prices and contract delivery dates and completions in England and Scotland. I think we inevitably tend to suffer because our scale of work is on the whole smaller than the scale of work in England, but do we not sometimes deliberately chop it up too small? Are some of our schemes in some places too patchy because we are trying to be fair? Everyone has demands, and all are asking for money. Are we not handing it out in too small parcels? When the Under-Secretary of State does come to speak of the new policies there are things we should like to hear about.<br><br>
I notice in the Report that, in the last three years, only eight miles of the 30 mile an hour speed limit roads have been put up to 40 miles per hour. I believe that this is wrong. There are a great many areas—I will not specify them, but we all know them—where there are great twin-track roads into cities and which still have a limit of 30 m.p.h. I think that is not improving safety. What it is doing is adding to the frustration and making motorists feel that the limits are not sensible.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, the Under-Secretary will look at a problem which is causing a lot of trouble, and will go on doing so, on roads through agricultural areas where stock—cows, sheep, and so on—are free to wander. He knows of a particular case in my county but there are similar cases all over the Highlands and in the Borders and Lowlands. I think that the Government should formulate a firm policy and let people know what they are doing about this matter. Attractive as I am sure it would be to the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) that farmers should fence all the roads, it would be an enormous task and the Government should have a clear and stated policy. When I was Minister we came very near to a firm policy.<br><br>
I ask the Under-Secretary of State to look with sympathy, in all the pleas for extra money, at the congested district scheme. I know that is a small one, but I believe that just as we are trying to use our road policy for industrial development so we ought to spend more money—and we are spending some—on preventing active depopulation. I think a litle more is needed there.<br><br>
The last two things I would ask him to think about is, one, whether in Scotland we are training a sufficient number of traffic engineers—if that is the right expression to use. These people will be vitally necessary in the future and I hope that we shall make certain Scotland has a good share of them when they are needed.<br><br>
Lastly, on the question of the speed problem, I wonder whether he would consider—I do not know whether it is altogether a good idea—the possibility that at weekends, say, from Saturday lunch-time to Sunday evenings, L drivers might be banned from trunk roads. I do not think that would result in great hardship. As I go along the side of Loch Lomond, as I do regularly on Sunday evenings, I have, over and over again, seen long queues of vehicles behind an L-driver travelling at what for him was the right speed, but a speed which has resulted in a queue of vehicles forming behind him. It is a small point but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
perhaps the road safety people would look at it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clear up one point before trying to answer the many points which have been put to me. If I do not take up some of these points during the 12 minutes left for me in which to reply I hope that I may be excused. I will write to hon. Members on the matters which they have raised. I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) for curtailing his remarks. We are all victims of circumstances.<br><br>
The point I wish to clear up was, in a sense, cleared up for me by the right hon. Member. I have interrupted him, quite improperly, as the result of emotion. I referred to the question of starts. I think it fair to say that a Government may prepare schemes, but a new Government when they take over their options. They may take up what has been prepared or they may stop some schemes and go on with others. This means that new schemes must be prepared. A new Government do not have to go on with all the preparations which have been made by a previous Government. When the right hon. Member referred to numbers he was, in a sense, giving me my point. We are entitled, as the right hon. Gentleman would have been had his Party been returned to power, to look again at the options and decide on which to pursue in the light of certain principles. I apologise for the speed at which I read out the list at the end of my first speech. I gave credit for the completions started under the previous Government and I ask for a little credit for this Government for having continued these schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For not having stopped them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For going as fast or faster in completing them than did the previous Administration. We do not know what the right hon. Gentleman would have done had he been in office. He would have had to consider the balance of payments deficit, with all its economic repercussions, the change of climate in the Treasury which inevitably faces Ministers in such a situation, and so on. I was trying to give credit where it is due and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
at the same time I was appealing to the Committee to give credit to this Government as well.<br><br>
The situation is best illustrated by the remarks of the right hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) who is in the difficult position of having to represent two counties. One of these counties, Berwickshire, is well ahead with its preparations. When I visited East Lothian I found that the county had not perhaps got as much money as was merited, bearing in mind the priorities, between, let us say, Berwickshire and East Lothian. I do not wish to become too much involved in this, but I think it fair to say that whatever might have been the decisions of the previous Government, which are not for me to defend, Berwickshire was always there and ready to get money if it could be provided by the central Government. East Lothian has its problems. We cannot take away the problem of the by-passes and not only the Dunbar by-pass. I agree that is in a very bad state and something ought to be done about it quite soon, although the priorities must be sorted out. There are the problems of the Tranent and the Musselburgh by-passes, and where the radial road will be in Edinburgh. The question of the road in Edinburgh must be settled before deciding the lines of the Tranent and Musselburgh roads.<br><br>
There are not only the social priorities, but physical priorities and traffic priorities, which makes the roads department of the Scottish Office one of the most difficult—I say this in the best sense—in which to make decisions. All kinds of pressures are exerted, and it is not necessarily right that the correct decision is made simply by giving in to quite legitimate pressures from deputations. We have a saying in Scotland, "The greetin bairn aye gets fed first". It is a good policy which I can recommend to other hon. Members. There are hon. Members more experienced than I who have done this better than I shall be able to do. They should insist on priority for their areas, because who else is there to do it if they do not? But in central Government one must look at the options from a different point of view.<br><br>
I must tell the right hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
already done a little in relation to the road he mentioned. We have dealt with Belton ford which he mentioned in the quotation from the interesting poem to which he referred. I hope that another scheme near Tranent will start this summer on these substandard lengths of road. I can hold out no hope of works on a bigger scale, but I am looking into some of the suggestions that were made to me and I will see, after the Belton ford cross-roads scheme is finished, whether other sections of the Dunbar by-pass could usefully be tackled progressively, without incurring the very high cost of the whole original scheme.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) asked whether we could have a renewal of the Agricultural (Improvement of Roads) Act, 1955, which he knows his right hon. Friend decided in 1962 not to renew. We will look at this. Again I do not wish to hold out any definite hope. The hon. Member's right hon. Friend made his decision in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that time, and we may come to the same conclusion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) in what I thought was a very good speech—if I may say so without appearing to be patronising—made a point which the Scots do not sufficiently emphasise and which it would be to our benefit to emphasise more. It was that Scotland is a paradise for motorists, despite all the deficiencies of our roads. It is a delight to motor in Scotland. I am a motorist, although I do not get much time for motoring these days, and I enjoy motoring in Scotland rather than in any other part of the United Kingdom. If we had more tourists on the roads, we might have better traffic figures and if the traffic figures were better, we might get more money. We should impress on the English the fact that we should not be wasting United Kingdom money if it were spent on the development of roads for tourism. I think it right to point out that not all our roads are as bad as is made out, even in this Committee. We should try to attract our fellow citizens from the South to come to the North. I will not take up some of the minor points which the hon. Member mentioned. I will write to him.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
We are much concerned about the position in Edinburgh and discussions are progressing with the Corporation. We should like to do a full traffic census, perhaps next year when the road bridge will have had its maximum impact on the city. Already we find that most people who travel in the direction of Edinburgh wish to enter the city and not to by-pass it. Although that pattern may change with the development of other road extensions and the system may alter, we must find out what is the present position before building the ring road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Tay road bridge is open a large amount of heavy traffic from the North-East will require to get through Edinburgh quickly. I hope that the ring road will be ready in a year or two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That, I think, is being too optimistic. We must take the traffic assessment of the A1 which is not as heavily trafficked as the A74. There may be a change in the pattern as a consequence of the opening of the bridge, and this may affect the traffic figures. The whole point is, where does one start? In this case we have to decide by relying on the traffic assessment. I cannot answer the point about the Forth Road Bridge with figures at the present time. I have given Answers in the House on this subject. I think that the experience of the summer will tell us whether the original estimates were nearly right. We should wait until the bridge has been used more heavily in the summer in order to get the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman do his best to keep the railways?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter which involves overall transport planning in Edinburgh. There is a survey going on with the west of Scotland and we hope to have a similar survey in relation to Edinburgh.<br><br>
On the question of the Alexandria by-pass I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele) on yet another good speech. When preparing for this debate I read all his speeches. I remember the one about expenditure, and about how close the Department got to matching estimates with actual expenditure. I went
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
over the figures with the officials and the record is remarkable. Here we are making a Departmental criticism about whether or not the officials can get close to their own estimates. They do very well. I say that in their presence and I congratulate them. We hope that the proposals for the Alexandria by-pass on the A.82 will be dealt with soon. The work on the first stage begins in 1967 and we may complete both stages by 1970. I am advised that that is the position. I am willing to look into this matter again and talk it over with my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Regarding the Ayr by-pass, the hon. Member for Galloway will be delighted to know that the Secretary of State has undertaken to discuss the need for this with the Ayr Town Council at the earliest opportunity. Meanwhile a box junction
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
arrangement, of the type to be seen in Oxford Street in London, is being introduced where the temporary route crosses the Ayr-Girvan railway to prevent traffic from blocking the crossing.<br><br>
Regarding the Warboys signs, provision has been made in the 1965–66 Estimates for extra expenditure amounting to £143,000 for trunk roads and £188,000 on classified roads. It is unlikely that the expenditure on classified roads will reach this figure. This is not only an exercise in spending money well but also in persuading local authorities to co-operate fully—</span></p>
