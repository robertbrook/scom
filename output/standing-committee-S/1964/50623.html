	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Regis-stration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet tomorrow at half-past Ten o'clock and at Four o'clock.—[	<i>Mrs. Hart.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. Copies of it are available in this Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(THE REGISTRAR GENERAL.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose, for the convenience of the Committee, that we take, with the first Amendment, Amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 17, leave out "without prejudice to that generality".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 17, to leave out "without prejudice to that generality" and to insert "subject to that general duty".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a number of Amendments, and so have hon. Gentlemen opposite. Some of the Opposition Amendments have drawn our attention to points in the Bill that needed examination. We are very grateful to hon. Gentlemen opposite for that, even though we have put down Amendments which are slightly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be clear if one looks at the subsection which is affected by the Amendment now before the Committee, that if one left out altogether the words "without prejudice to that generality" without putting something in their place one would not quite cover all the contingencies which it is necessary to cover. The "generality" referred to—I agree that it is a rather awkward word—embraces every function conferred upon the Registrar General by any enactment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The effect of the inclusion of the phrase is that the Registrar General is not to avoid, negative or prejudice the exercise of his other statutory functions. In other words, in the exercise of his power in the latter part of this subsection he is still subject to the general duty set out in the first part of the subsection. In this context, the phrase might be best translated as "subject to that general duty". If the words were entirely left out, the subsection might be read as conferring unlimited discretion upon the Registrar General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is to get the right sort of safeguarding phrase. The one used in the Bill is most commonly used in narrating a particular power already covered by the preceding generality, but here we confer an additional power. On further consideration, "subject to that general duty" seems advisable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of crossing swords with the Under-Secretary or of breaking the spirit of amiability with which the proceedings have opened. I am grateful to her for what she has said about our object in putting down Amendments. The present Amendment is typical, in that it is to simplify the Bill. I must confess I have a suspicion, despite the hon. Lady's persuasive arguments, that the phrase we are proposing to take out is draftsman's legal jargon. I am not convinced that there is a great deal behind the words, even those which the hon. Lady suggests should be substituted. They are better than the words which are in the Bill. I would think it not impossible to strike a blow for brevity and to leave out the words altogether, but I shall not press our Amendment on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest, for the convenience of the Committee, that we take with Amendment No. 4, the Government Amendment, No. 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 19, to leave out "utility" and to insert "service and efficiency".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of no great substance, but I am all for using in legislation words which one uses oneself. "Utility" is not a word which many of us use
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
in our everyday conversation, whereas the phrase we suggest, "service and efficiency" covers what the word "utility" implies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of a letter which was brought to me to sign, during the last Government, when I was an Under-Secretary of State, to send to the hon. Lady, the present Under-Secretary of State, concerning one of her constituents about whom she had written to me. The draft which was given to me had a phrase in it which I shall always remember. It was, "As this case is not ambulant", it would be impossible to do what the hon. Lady wanted done. I said to the Scottish Office official, "Do you really at your breakfast table in the morning say to your wife 'Are you going to be ambulant around the shops?' Why on earth cannot we say, 'This case cannot walk?'".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the feeling I have about the word "utility" in this phrase. The words we suggest do precisely what that word does, and in a more natural and less stilted manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the sentiments of the hon. Gentleman and would wish that at least twenty words I can think of might pass from all official language and for which one can always find something better and simpler. I share his approach to the general question of simplified language in official communications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a slight difficulty here in using the word "service" because it would mean that we should be using the word "service" in two sentences, and in the same line. We think that this would lead to difficulty and that "service" should not go in. We are very glad to agree about "efficiency". We have thought about the word "utility". Certainly, "usefulness" is a nicer word but the other word goes a bit further. Having carefully weighed the use of the words we feel that our Amendment is slightly better than that of the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member wish to withdraw his Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for pointing out the two uses of the one word. That makes her Amendment very much better than ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment made:</i> In page 1, line 19, after "utility" insert "and efficiency".—[	<i>Mrs. Hart.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose, for the convenience of the Committee, that we take with Amendment No. 5 Amendment No. 6, in page 1, fine 22, to leave out "general abstract" and to insert "summary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 22, to leave out from "containing" to "of" in line 23, and to insert "the numbers".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had our attention drawn to this point by Amendment No. 6 in the name of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), but we have found difficulty in accepting his Amendment, although we could see the point of it. It is difficult to accept the expression
	<br><blockquote><p>"a summary of the number of births, deaths and marriages"</p></blockquote>
because it is not clear what "the summary of a number" means. The Opposition is quite right in proposing that the expression "general abstract" should be left out. It goes back to the 1854 Act and it is not in ordinary use today for statistical tables. We can get along quite well without it, if we substitute "numbers" as proposed in my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we have taken a step towards improving the Bill and have inspired the hon. Lady to do better still. I have no desire to press our Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now propose we take together the next two Amendments, No. 7 and No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 1, to leave out "year last preceding" and to insert "previous year".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a more natural way of describing the process. I do not propose to go to any length in argument advocating this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we looked at the Opposition Amendment we found that neither the words originally in the Clause nor those in the Amendment would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0815">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
quite right. They might be troublesome in practice. The Amendment brought to light the fact that we needed to make an alteration here. It is largely a technical matter of printing the Registrar General's report, which is a volume of 400 pages, mainly of statistical tables. It is a complicated printing job. It is usually possible to get the report published before the end of the year following the year to which the tables relate, but printing has run into the next year on two occasions in the last 12 years and that could happen again. The purpose of our Amendment is to allow for this situation, so that even if the report is not quite ready till a later stage, it will still be possible to lay it before Parliament and have it published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment made:</i> In page 2, line 1, leave out "last preceding" and insert "to which the report relates".—[	<i>Mrs. Hart.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to enter into much discussion on this Question, Mr. Lever. This is a very technical Bill and I think the purpose of the Clause is well understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>Clause 2.—(REGISTRAR GENERAL'S STAFF.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose, again for the convenience of the Committee, to take together Amendment No. 9 and Amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 14, leave out subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Would we be quite right in taking those Amendments together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is any objection whatever to taking them together I am quite happy that they should be taken separately. It is a highly technical Bill and I gather the hon. Member wants them taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Lever, I am quite happy to have them taken together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 6, after "General", to insert "to act on his behalf".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall be able to persuade the hon. Member that the two Amendments do go very closely together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I thought that here we really could cut out quite a substantial part, amounting to two and a half lines, which is not insignificant in a Bill, and by inserting five words achieve precisely the same result, because, as hon. Members will see, subsection (3), which we are proposing to omit, says that virtually anything that the Registrar-General may have to do or have done before him or by him may be done by the Deputy Registrar-General. Therefore it seemed not unreasonable to insert in subsection (1) that the Registrar-General may appoint a Deputy Registrar-General to act on this behalf. This would cover all that subsection (3) states may be done by the Deputy once he is appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can well understand the motives which inspire the hon. Gentleman, but in fact there is a difficulty here. It is a simple one and I think he will appreciate it. Other Acts empower the Registrar-General to do various things, but they do not empower a person acting on his behalf, so the effect of this Amendment would be to provide in this Bill something which is not provided for in other Acts of Parliament which also empower the Registrar-General—for example, the Census Acts and the Marriage Acts. I agree the object would seem to be simple, namely to shorten the Clause, but the effect would in fact be different. If the Amendment were accepted the functions of the Deputy would be in some doubt, whereas subsection (3) makes these functions absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Amendment which the hon. Gentleman proposes the Registrar General would have to issue some authorisation to his Deputy to act on his behalf, and the Amendment does not make it clear whether the Deputy is to have a general power so to act or whether he is to have a whole series of specific powers. The Clause makes it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
clear that the power to act is a general one, and we think there is advantage in saying so in the Clause itself. Also, to be logical one would have to amend in a similar way the Census Acts and the Marriage Acts and all the other Statutes which involve the duties of the Registrar General, and giving him the power to appoint somebody to act on his behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this reason we prefer the text of the Clause. In fact the effort made by the hon. Gentleman to shorten it would on this occasion seriously change the sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 18, to leave out from "Act" to "General" and insert "a".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Again my hon. Friends and I did not altogether see that it was essential to have words such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"premises which shall be known as the General Register Office".</p></blockquote>
and that we could quite easily have said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be maintained for the purposes of this Act a General Register Office of Births, Death and Marriages in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
With regard to Amendment No. 12, I think it has precisely the same effect as subsection (3) in the Clause. There is no change in the meaning at all, but I believe our Amendment is an improvement in the drafting and gives a more positive approach to what the Registrar General and the Secretary of State for Scotland may do. That is the sole purpose of it. I personally believe it is an improvement, and I hope that on this occasion we have managed to do the right thing and that the hon. Lady will be able to agree with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to Amendment No. 11 there is a difficulty, for a reason which I think the hon. Gentleman will appreciate. He proposes to leave out here the reference to premises. That could readily be accepted if this were the only reference to premises in this Clause. In fact, in subsection (3) as it now stands, and in the new subsection (3) which the hon. Gentleman would propose there is a reference to "any other premises", which would lead to a certain awkwardness.

In regard to Amendment No. 12 this alteration involves no change of meaning at all, and I think it is, perhaps, a little more elegant. Therefore we would be happy to accept it as an improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is only one small point and I am sure I shall be able to get the hon. Lady to agree with what I have to say. The original Bill, before it went to another place, had in this Clause the words "a General Register Office in Edinburgh", and this restriction was removed in another place in order to allow latitude—at least I suspect this was the reason—to allow possibly, the extended offices or premises to be placed, may be, in one of the new towns in Scotland. I was tempted to insert the words "in Scotland" and to delete the words "in Edinburgh" but I came to the conclusion that, being generally in favour of taking words out, these were perhaps superfluous. I wonder whether, merely for the sake of the record, the hon. Lady would say that the premises are quite certain to be in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do give that categorical assurance. I do not think any Government at any time would have any intention of removing the General Register Office away from Scotland to any other place, and I think it would be monstrous if any such proposal were made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that quite a logical conclusion to reach? Unless this is written into the Bill, it might be moved over the Border, as many of our offices have been moved in the past, and so precedent shows that unless it is stipulated quite clearly in an Act of Parliament where a particular office shall be situated it can very soon move in the wrong direction. We would all deprecate it if this office were to come to London, such as has happened with the principal offices of the Board of Trade, and Health and various other Departments. If there is any problem appertaining to Scotland and connected with trade and commerce it is now necessary to come to London. So unless it is stipulated that this office should be situated in Scotland it may happen in the not far distant future that it will find its way down to London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would merely explain for the sake of the record that both the hon. Gentleman's Amendment and the Government Amendment have the same object, namely to fill a gap in subsection (3). Without amendment it might have been argued that the Registrar General would have no statutory authority to obtain money to pay his staff. The hon. Gentleman is happy to have our Amendment, and we think it makes the position slightly clearer, and, of course, it is more exactly in the terms of the Money Resolution. We are, however, grateful for having had our attention directed to the point, which needed to be included in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if again I could ask the hon. Lady to clarify one word in this Clause. In subsection (1) there is reference to the officers who are appointed by the Registrar General. Could the hon. Lady tell the Committee what people these officers include? Obviously they are his personal assistants, and, I imagine, the district examiners. Is everybody who works in the General Register Office included under this heading? Does it included, for example, the Secretaries, typists, and doorkeepers? If so, I have my doubts about whether the right way of fixing the salaries of these officers is by allowing the Treasury from time to time to direct or determine as is laid down in subsection (1). Could the hon. Lady answer that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that everybody working for the Registrar General,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
with the exception of the doorkeepers, is included in subsection (1). The subsection says
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be paid to the Registrar General and to the officers appointed by him such salaries or remuneration as the Treasury may from time to time determine."</p></blockquote>
This is what generally happens throughout the Civil Service as a result of negotiation. The money comes from the Treasury. It is the Treasury which has the main control of the Establishments Branch of the Civil Service, and it is always as a result of negotiation and discussion that salaries are determined by the Treasury. I do not think we need have any concern about this matter. I am not clear about the distinction between the doorkeepers and the secretaries and other employees. I do not know why their salaries should not come within the subsection, but if the hon. Gentleman is particularly concerned about this point I will make inquiries and find the answer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see here a possible balance of payments difficulty.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It probably depends how successful the Registrar General is in selling his wares. If everybody in Scotland suddenly decides to make the statistical report or the annual report a best seller which is full of fascinating and interesting information, his profits that year will be quite considerable and the gap between income and outgoings will be less. In general, he has to cover the expenses of the service which he provides. He has to cover much of the cost of the statistical research which goes into preparing his report and all his tables. The receipts will come from sales, but these will be minimal. No accurate answer can be given to the hon. Gentleman, but I think that he will agree that the Registrar General should be regarded primarily as what might be called a service industry rather than a profit-making industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to us that this Amendment was a way of saying in one word what is set out in a more elaborate form in subsection (6), which reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"A scheme under this section may contain such incidental, consequential or supplemental provisions as may appear necessary or proper for the purposes of the scheme …"</p></blockquote>
I did not find much difficulty in thinking that the word "appropriate" would cover the intention of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the object of the Amendment is to shorten the Clause, but, in our view, something would be lost by accepting it. The difficulty is that the word "appropriate" is, more or less—it is a question of balance—equivalent to the expression "necessary or proper" but is a little less precise and informative. "Necessary" means a bit more than "appropriate". The Amendment proposes to omit the words "for the purposes of the scheme", again for the sake of brevity, but there is some point in making it clear that any supplemental provisions contained in a scheme are limited in scope to the purposes of the scheme alone. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
have considered the matter and appreciate why the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that "appropriate" would hardly entirely fulfil the function of the word "necessary".

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause breaks new ground in the alteration of the registration districts. This was a field in which formerly the sheriffs used to operate. I should like to raise one point on subsection (1). Presumably the meaning of this is that a local registration authority in one county may take over the registrations in an adjoining county if there is, for argument's sake, no town nearby and it would be more convenient so to do. I imagine that this is the object of the reference to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"two or more adjoining local registration authorities"</p></blockquote>
considering it expedient to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of thing which I have in mind is this. The constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) runs closely down in a very rural area to the town of Kelso, in Roxburghshire. In that area of Berwickshire there is barely a hamlet or community. I therefore take it that the Bill would enable Kelso to take over the registrations of that part of Berwickshire for administrative efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point on which I should like elucidation is how the finances of this operation will be adjusted between the two local authorities. This could be a matter of dispute, even though it might not amount to much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman thinks that there might be difficulty about finances. What the subsection says is that authorities which are prepared to get together and form one registration authority would prepare and submit to the Secretary of State a scheme for that purpose after consultation with the Registrar General. The scheme would deal with all these sorts of points. The financial arrangements would be part of that scheme and would be adopted by agreement between the local authorities. There are precedents which have worked quite satisfactorily. I think that the short answer is that there would be agreement and that on the basis of the agreement a scheme would be worked out which embodied all these financial details and the matter would then go smoothly forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(in this Act referred to as 'senior registrars')".</p></blockquote>
We suggest this Amendment only because the district and assistant registrars are treated in this way, and we cannot see why the senior registrar should be left out in the cold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to accept this Amendment. It is a drafting Amendment which is an improvement in the cause of consistency. What the hon. Gentleman has said is quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The object of the Amendment is to make clear that in exercising all the functions which registrars have under a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
number of Statutes the registrar will be subject to the restriction or the directions of the Registrar-General. The most notable example is the Marriage (Scotland) Act, 1939, which deals with the conduct and registration of civil marriages. There are also a few Statutes which place the duty on registrars to issue special certificates for specific purposes—for example, the Family Allowances Act, 1945, and the National Insurance Act, 1946. I hope that the Committee will agree that the Amendment is a necessary improvement and that it will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 5, line 42, after "authority" to insert "after consultation with the Registrar General".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard this as an Amendment of very much more substance than any other Amendment which we have so far considered. In another place, an effort was made to have the words "with the consent of the Registrar General" inserted. That attempt failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clause is drafted, the remuneration and allowances paid to district registrars are entirely a matter for the determination of the local authority. I can well understand the feeling of unease among many of the district registrars in Scotland that there may be wide discrepancies as between a local authority in Aberdeenshire and one in Berwickshire. If there is no contact between the two, it could be that registrars doing the same kind of work in two different villages at different ends of Scotland could have widely differing salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obvious bridgehead is the Registrar General, who must be well acquainted with the salary scales being paid. I can well appreciate the feelings of local authorities in being told that they must get the consent of the Registrar General, because, obviously, they would then be having to depend on the approval of a third party for the way in which they spend their money. I think, however, that to say that they should consult the Registrar General is eminently reasonable. I do not believe that they could or should feel prickly with indignation about this, and if the hon. Lady can see her way to accept this, it will do
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
much to allay some of the anxieties which district registrars have been expressing on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that this is a much more substantive Amendment than any we have been discussing. Perhaps I should say at the outset that I am proposing to accept it, because many of the points the hon. Member has made are right, and we have been considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing so I want to put the record straight on a point, because since the consideration of principle of the Bill we have been able to obtain more information about arbitration between N.A.L.G.O. and the local authorities in Scotland. We take this new information into account in believing that we would be right to accept the Amendment. We just did not have complete information, at the time, of the exact workings of the machinery within N.A.L.G.O. and as between N.A.L.G.O. and the local authorities. In replying to the debate of the Committee on 27th May I said that appeal to the industrial courts is open in the event of deadlock in negotiations under Whitley machinery. This is quite correct, but at present, and this is what we did not realise, there is an understanding between the two sides in Scotland that extends only to references on matters of pay and conditions of service which are of general application to all local authority employees. It does not extend to references concerning particular classes of staff. This information, I am sorry to say, was not available to us at the time. Therefore I am anxious to put the record straight on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another fact which enters into our desire to accept the Amendment. That is that there are some practical advantages in the local registration authority consulting the Registrar General before determining the salary of a post or the appropriate negotiated scale for it. The Registrar General may be able to give advice to the local authority or information about comparable work loads in other parts of Scotland, or he may be able to give help about the future work load which might be expected in a particular district. All these are points which the local authority might wish to take into account in considering the salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The position will now be, with the Amendment, that it will bring the consultation with the Registrar General into the determination of the salaries of individual posts or a group of posts, but without involving him in either Whitley negotiations as to scales, or in the sphere of the Industrial Court. It therefore seems a fair and workable way of dealing with the situation, and I am glad to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>",or any person who, but for such service of his as may be so specified, would be such a person, officer or servant as aforesaid,".</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is designed simply to bring the compensation subsection into line with the compensation provisions in Statutes passed in recent years. The Local Government Act, 1958, is one example. Its purpose is to ensure that compensation will be payable to any registration staff who may have been called up for National Service. It is merely bringing this piece of legislation into line with recent legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 22, in page 6, line 25, to leave out "may be prescribed for that appointment" and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Registrar General may from time to time determine".</p></blockquote>
This Amendment removes the need to prescribe qualifications which would thereby become manadatory. It will give the Registrar General discretion to modify what he thinks to be the desirable qualifications for a registrar in any case where that is necessary. The essential qualifications are that a registrar should be of good character and be able to write legibly, and he should preferably not be under 21 or over 60. Obviously because of the nature of the job we do not want them too young or old. The difficulty is that about 860 of the 925 registrars are part-time, and many of them are in sparsely populated rural areas with only a few registrations a year. In this kind of area it can be difficult to find registrars in the recommended age group, and it is inevitable that in some cases retired people over 65 may be the only ones suitable or available to carry out the work. Many
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
of the existing part-time registrars are retired people over 65, such as retired schoolmasters. By leaving the determination of the qualifications to the Registrar General without the necessity to prescribe mandatory qualifications, he will be enabled to approve the appointment of people of this kind where he thinks that they are completely suitable and where no one else is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I ask the hon. Lady to elucidate one point in subsection (1)? What precisely will be the difference in the duties which an additional district registrar will have to do compared with those of an assistant registrar for any registration district? I presume the duties will be more or less the same, but that the rank or grade is different. But whether this is so, I do not know. There is an obligation on the local registration authorities to consult the Registrar-General about appointing an additional district registrar or a senior registrar, and they have to inform him of whom they appoint, but they do not have to consult him about appointing the assistant one: they only have to tell him. If, as I would have supposed, the duties and responsibilities are going to be very much the same, it seems rather strange that there should not be consultation about each appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the rather wider subject of the dual control as between the local registration authority and the Registrar-General. We did have a very good discussion on the negotiating powers, and the hon. Lady has touched on this and the ability to go to arbitration. I would only repeat that I am firmly convinced that things are much better now under dual control, or, perhaps, I should say even under dual control, than they were when there was the third interested party in this, the sheriff. All the same, we still have a situation where registrars are to be appointed and paid by the local registration authority, with the step forward since Second Reading that the Registrar-General is going to be consulted on salary. We are going to have the registrars supervised by the Registrar-General. We are going to have them dismissed by the local registration
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
authority, again after consultation with the Registrar-General. We are going to have some of their equipment coming from the Registrar-General, unless the hon. Lady is going to accept certain Amendments we have down about this, and some of it coming from the local registration authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Second Reading the hon. Lady founded her argument in favour of this very largely on the situation and the views expressed in England. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is in England and Wales no similar demand for centralisation of control. This seems extraordinary, but it is related to the question of salary negotiation and the success of achieving methods of salary negotiation. … What we can best do is to give this revised system of share control a fair trial, see how it goes and see whether any similar demand for centralised control emerges from England and Wales."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 27th May, 1965; c. 44.]</p></blockquote>
As a result of that statement, I received a somewhat indignant letter from one of the registrars in Edinburgh, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am reliably informed by the Hon. General Secretary of the National Association of Registration Officers, England and Wales, that a very firm suggestion on their part has been made to the Minister of Health to the effect that there should be a centralised control of the registration service in England and Wales, and that in fact this was one of the recommendations included in a Petition which was presented to Parliament by that Association last year."</p></blockquote>
In view of that there would, with all respect to the Minister, seem to be a discrepancy between what she told us at Second Reading and what the views of the registrars in England appear to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that point aside, it seems to me that in view of the Petition which evidently has already been presented to Parliament it is clear that in England a move will be made sooner or later towards centralised control. It would be a thousand pities that this or another matter on which we shall be touching later, the system of registration of births, will in two or three years under English legislation move into a position slightly ahead of the position to which the registrars of Scotland would like to move, and because of the fact that at that particular time there will be no Scottish legislation, we shall have to wait a further spell of years till we have another Bill of this kind. Therefore I do sincerely ask the hon. Lady if she can somehow take steps to see that we can slip easily into line
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
on this question of centralised control, if the move in England and Wales does take place in that direction, and thereby fulfil what, I am in no doubt about, are the wishes of the big majority of registrars. Admittedly there is the problem of the part-time element, but I believe that there is a strong desire on the part of many district registrars in Scotland that there should be more control by the Registrar-General over their affairs. I hope that the hon. Lady will be able to ensure that, if England and Wales go in that direction, we shall be able to do so, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in the appreciation expressed to the Under-Secretary of State for having gone, as far as I can see, a long way, if not all the way, towards meeting one of the points which were represented to me and others by the registrars of Scotland concerning arbitration and salary negotiating machinery. I am very grateful for what she said on Amendment No. 20, to page 5, line 42, and I think that it will be very much to the satisfaction of the registrars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our consideration of the principle we discussed at length the question of dual control and centralised control. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has put the case extremely well and I shall not repeat it. We must watch closely what is being done in England at present, because we may well be able to learn a useful lesson from the discussions taking place between the Ministry of Health and the registrars. At Second Reading, I pleaded that we should try to bring into the Bill a permissive provision under which centralisation of control could become a possibility at a later stage, perhaps without the need for cumbersome legislation. I do not know whether this is a practical possibility, but I should certainly regard it as desirable. I referred on that occasion to the difference in the situation between the scattered rural districts and the large urban conurbations of Glasgow and Edinburgh in particular. Clearly, centralisation of control is in many respects desirable in the big cities but, perhaps, not so desirable in the country districts. In my view, we should have some permissive phrasing in the Bill which would make it possible for us to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
achieve what we hope to achieve eventually without the need for cumbersome legislation later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the gratitude which has been expressed by my hon. Friends to the hon. Lady for her co-operation on our Amendments. One point arising out of the Clause is the question of arrangements to be made when a registrar is absent. From a reading of the Regulations in the registrars' manual, it seems that, should a registrar be absent—apparently, this applies only on death—the sheriff has to appoint an interim registrar. What about holidays? In rural areas, the registration offices of adjoining districts may be miles apart, and it may not be possible for the next-door registrar to be responsible. What is the procedure during absence on holiday, perhaps for a fortnight or three weeks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, although registrars are, as we know, extremely helpful at all times, there may well arise the question of the balance of convenience struck as regards a marriage at an unusual time or on an unusual day when the registrar himself might well be elsewhere. What is the arrangement here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the points in reverse order as they were put. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) asked what happens when registrars are on holiday. The answer is that an assistant registrar takes over if the registrar himself is absent, and arrangements always have to be such that there is an assistant registrar who can take over when the registrar is ill, away on leave or absent for some other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, I was asked about the balance of convenience between client and registrar, as it were. I confess that I do not have the answer to this question because no cases have been brought to my attention of marriages which could not take place at the time when the parties wished them to take place. If the hon. Gentleman has cases of this kind in mind when there was inconvenience because of the time, perhaps he will let me know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) asked about the possibility of permissive legislation. To have permissive legislation here,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
enabling us to have a transition, as it were, from dual or shared control to centralised control, would require great complication. The Bill would have to be enormously complex to provide for that. I think that we need not yet look to that point arising, because we are all quite clear that, for the time being, we should let shared control have a go and see how it works and how it satisfies the various interests concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) asked what were the duties of the various kinds of registrar and, in particular, what were the duties of the additional district registrars. They have exactly the same duties as the district registrars. In a very large registration authority area in which there is a great deal of work there may be a number of staff some of whom are additional district registrars. For example, in Glasgow there are 14 registrars, in effect; one of them is a district registrar and the other 13 are additional district registrars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, the hon. Gentleman asked why the Registrar General did not need to be consulted about the appointment of assistant registrars. The answer is that the assistant registrar is subordinate to and works under the supervision of the district registrar, and it is only the senior officer under whose supervision the more junior officers work whose position really merits the need for consultation with the Registrar General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the detailed points, as it were, and I now turn to the major point which the hon. Gentleman raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, it would be a mistake if the Committee were to attempt in any way to move into the affairs of England and Wales. I certainly should not wish to do so. I have noted what the hon. Gentleman said, and I am sorry that I did not have any information about the petition from the registrars in England and Wales to the Minister of Health when we considered the Bill in principle on 27th May. I am not sure that it was necessary for me to have known, except that I should not have said quite what I did had I known. But what is of relevance to the Scottish picture is what the Scottish registrars say, not what the English registrars are saying to the Minister of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The hon. Gentleman will recall that I said that there did not seem to be any demand from the registrars in England and Wales or from the local authorities. I was mistaken as regards the position of registrars in England and Wales because I did not know about the petition of eighteen months ago. I should not want to enter into discussion of that petition or of the relationship between the registrars and the system in England and Wales. In effect, it means that what I said on the previous occasion about there being no similar demand for centralised control in England and Wales applies primarily to the local authorities. I understand that there has been no move from the English local authority associations for a change, whereas, as I said earlier, one of the three associations in Scotland, the Association of the Counties of Cities, was in favour of centralisation of control when it was consulted on proposals for legislation. This is the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our consideration of the principle, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) inquired about the position of registrars as regards political activities, and I promised him that I would obtain further information. The answer is that their position is unaffected by the Bill. Like all who hold positions of profit under a local authority, they are precluded from nomination for or election to their local council, but there would not seem to be any bar to a registrar becoming a member of the council of another local authority in the area in which he happened to live. It is only on his employing authority that he may not serve. Perhaps I may add that, as a class, registrars are not in any way disqualified under the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, from membership of Parliament, so they have a fair degree of freedom in political activity, which was the issue upon which my hon. Friend was anxious to have reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 57, in Clause 32, page 20, line 31, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and a suitable fireproof repository or strong fire-resisting boxes for the safe custody of the records";</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 58, in line 32, after "registers" to insert "boxes".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Lever. The effect of this Amendment is to make a change in the proposed ownership of the actual containers holding the records. I say in passing that I much prefer the Government's new description in a later Amendment of "fireproof safes or cabinets" instead of "strong fire-resisting boxes". But the Bill as it stands provides that the Registrar General shall supply the registers, the certificates, the schedules, the notices, the forms and all the other documents which may be necessary for the district registrar. The local registration authority, under the Bill, is to provide the containers into which the registers, certificates, schedules, notices, forms and other documents will go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendment is to bracket the containers with the things which will go into them. I do not suggest that this is an Amendment of earth-shaking importance, but I suggest that the change would be desirable for three reasons. If the Registrar General is to supply the safes and cabinets, it would tend to standardise the equipment available, and I think that this would probably be useful. It would group all the, so to speak, moveable property under one head. In addition—I readily admit that this is an argument which attracts me—it would bring the Registrar General slightly more into control of affairs in this connection. As things stand, it is a slightly untidy arrangement. I do not put it higher than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several Amendments on this point. Taken together, their effect would be to transfer from the local registration authority to the Registrar General the responsibility for providing, in the local registration office, suitable fireproof storage for the records in the custody of the registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
In considering the Amendments we have to look at the present statutory position, at the nature of the local problems of storage and at what the Bill does to solve them. Under the 1860 Act, responsibility was placed upon the local authority for providing.
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fireproof safe or other place of deposit"</p></blockquote>
if so directed by the sheriff after he had received a written request from the Registrar General. The Bill leaves responsibility with the local registration authority, but omits the direction of the sheriff, that part of the Act having long since fallen into disuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Registers are preserved in one of two ways. In most registration offices, including those in shops, houses or premises occupied by part-time registrars, the present place of deposit is a safe, or two safes, or a safe and a fireproof cabinet. Where the office is part of local authority premises, there may be a safe or safes, or the local authority may have constructed a fireproof repository as part of its premises. Overcrowding is unusual in this kind of repository but is very often found where there is a safe. An additional safe or fireproof cabinet may cost anything from £100 to £250. In the smaller shops or cottages in the rural areas it is sometimes difficult to find space for an additional safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local problem therefore is not one of providing every registration office with an additional safe but rather of dealing with the overcrowding problem where it arises. There are a number of ways in which this can be done. For a number of years the Registrar General's Office has been taking in the older local registers and rebinding them in groups, so that they were not so bulky. A lot of this is going on, and will give added space. Local authorities can provide additional safes, or, as an alternative, can make use of the powers given to them for the first time in Clause 9 to provide an area repository, or more than one. Such a repository would be of considerable advantage in relieving local safes of the registers which run say, from 1855 to 1890, which are part of the storage problem. This method may in the long run be a great deal less expensive and troublesome than the provision of additional storage space in local offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The Amendment proposes that the hundred year old responsibility for fireproof storage for local registers should be transferred from the local authority to the Registrar General. I would put forward, as reasonable, several objections to such a transfer. First of all is the practical difficulty. Increasing use is being made of the local type of repository. It would be difficult to place upon the Registrar General the initiative and responsibility for providing these, whereas they are part of the local authority's building. The choice between providing an additional fireproof safe or cabinet and establishing an area repository should be taken by the local authority, because it has a closer knowledge of its registration offices and its own ideas for the preservation of the local historical records, in which there may well be a great deal of local pride. Many local people, inside and outside local government, look on the older registers of births, marriages and deaths as among the most precious local records. I do not think that anything should be done in the Bill to discourage this kind of local pride and local sense of history in wanting to preserve the written documentation of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be different views among local authorities about this matter, but there has been no request for an Amendment of this kind from any of the three local authority associations. I do not think the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has made out a case which is as strong as the case for keeping the Bill as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the Under-Secretary of State intends that there shall be a fairly liberal interpretation of the expression "fireproof safes", and so on. These can be very expensive and cabinets can be very large and I should like to know who is to pay for them. We must bear in mind that under the 1860 Act the first duty of the registrar in the event of fire is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to use every exertion to remove immediately the box of records to a place of safety"</p></blockquote>
The smaller the box compatible with security, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be a great deal of flexibility here. The main requirement is that these things should be fireproof and it is a question of finding the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause deals with an entirely new undertaking, the setting up in Scotland of area repositories. Can the hon. Lady tell us what sort of building she envisages the repositories will be? Are there likely to be many local authorities wishing to take advantage of this Clause? It is possibly to these local repositories that any overflow of registers may very properly go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause with which we have just dealt referred to fire-resisting boxes. Is it the intention that the repositories mentioned in the Clause we are now discussing will be adequately equipped with fire-resisting apparatus? I am thinking in terms of sprinkler systems, and so on. We all agree that fire-resisting boxes should be provided but it is still more important that the premises should be adequately equipped to resist fire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. It is imperative that these repositories should be made as fireproof as modern techniques provide, because these are historically valuable records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
As to the kind of repository, it might be an existing strong room which the local authority decides to use for the purpose, or a local record office, or local library. There are all kinds of ways in which repositories can be provided; nothing specific needs to be laid down. The Registrar General will have to approve whatever is done, so we can be sure that he will be satisfied with the location and suitability of the repositories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know how many of them there will be but in the Bill we are providing for the possibility and we shall encourage local authorities. We shall wait and see, and later on we may find that several local authorities have plans for suitable repositories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of fees to be accounted for it seems to me there is a point to be made that in this respect surely the district registrar, because of the duality of control which we know exists, is operating to quite a considerable extent on behalf of the Registrar General,
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
and not only on behalf of the local registration authority. I know he is employed by the authority but whether that ceases to make him operate to a certain extent on behalf of the Registrar General I am by no means certain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he is operating at all on behalf of the Registrar General what happens with regard to Clause 4(2)? Under that all the fees received by or on behalf of the Registrar General have to be paid to the Treasury. In Clause 12 all the fees collected by the district registrar go to the local registration authority. I think there might well be an ambiguity here. Unfortunately my hon. and learned Friend is not able to be with us this morning. Had he been here I might not have felt it necessary to raise this in the Committee, because he might have been able to explain it to me, and, as the hon. Lady knows, I am anxious to waste no time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interpretation of it would be that this is an illustration of the shared control. Where in Clause 4 we are talking of sums received by or on behalf of the Registrar General we are not referring to the kind of fees which are paid to the local registration authority for matters carried out and services rendered by the local registrars who are employed by the local registration authority. I think this is the distinction to be made, that the employing authority for the local registrar who receives fees is the local registration authority, and therefore it is to that authority that he must pay the fees he receives. Any sums received by the Registrar General could be of various kinds. For example, they could be fees for carrying out searches, for issuing certificates, and so on. In short, there are two services, two kinds of fees, and, therefore, there has to be a separation between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we go to the General Register Office and ask for a search to be made, a fee will be charged, and accounted for to the Treasury; but supposed we ask for a search to be made, say, in the district registrar's office. Although I accept that he is employed by the local authority I am still not entirely convinced that he is not working on behalf of the Registrar General. He is doing the same work in devolution, as it were, as the Registrar General is doing at the centre, and it seems to me there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0828">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

is a certain implication here that he is working on behalf of the Registrar General. I think this is a point which, perhaps, the hon. Lady might look at, and if need be, amend at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing Amendment merely to find out why the Registrar General should "otherwise direct". It deals with the registration in Scotland of a birth if it took place in a vehicle, aircraft, ship or motor car, or, I suppose, a railway train on the way to Scotland. The registration shall take place in Scotland unless the Registrar General should otherwise direct, and all we would like to know is, what can cause him to direct otherwise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer to this is that the Registrar General must be given discretion to deal with any exceptions in the light of the circumstances and in the light of the parents' wishes, as exceptions to the general rule that the place to which a new-born child is brought will be deemed to be the place where the birth occurred. Suppose a birth takes place in an ambulance, and the precise registration district where the birth occurred is known. Where, for example, the birth look place in an ambulance travelling between Leeds and Glasgow, and the birth occurred on the English side of the Border, it would obviously be desirable, if not necessary, for the Registrar General to direct that the proper place of registration is in England. This will interest the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the birth occurs at sea, or in an aircraft on its way here, the birth would actually fall to be registered in the Marine Register Book or the Air Register Book kept under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and the Civil Aviation Act, 1949, respectively. To register these in the Scottish registers would be duplication and would be unnecessary, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
certified copies of entries in both registers are sent to the Registrar General and extracts therefrom can be issued by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, sometimes the Registrar General will be giving his directions in a general way, as for example in regard to the Aviation Act; sometimes he will be doing it to meet the parents' wishes in cases where there is a doubt as to what the entry shall be and where he wants to be able to exercise the discretion in the light of knowing what the parents themselves would prefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty here because I understand my Amendment to Clause 14 will not be called because this is solely a Scottish Bill. I had rather hoped to bring out this precedent of the Civil Aviation Act, 1949, because it seemed to me to be about my only loophole for doing something about the great problem of the Border counties and of people being born in England and wishing to be registered in Scotland. The current Handbook points out that under the terms of the Civil Aviation Acts people born in an aircraft fall to be registered by the Minister of Civil Aviation. If the usual residence of the child's parents is in Scotland a certified copy of the registration of birth is sent to the Secretary-General's office, from which office an extract may be obtained on payment of three shillings. This seems to me to open the door, so that people who are born in a hospital in England, or even in an ambulance in England, whose usual residence is in Scotland, could in fact be registered in Edinburgh. I realise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Member is anticipating that Amendment No. 38 will be ruled out of order. He is correct in so anticipating, but it might be more in order if he were to make the contribution he is about to make on a Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. I would allow it there, as being a reasonable matter for discussion on that Question, but I cannot properly allow it on the Amendment we are at present discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Clause 14 stand part of the Bill, because I know the hon. Lady has been doing her very best to find some way to help me in this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important Clause because it breaks new ground. In making the registration of a birth possible in one of two places I am in no doubt at all that it is going to cause great convenience to many people who live in the remoter areas. In particular I dare say the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) may well feel this will be of substantial benefit to those of his constituents, let us say, from the western part of Ross-shire, who have to go to Inverness to have their babies and who can then register the birth back in the village in which they live rather than as, at the moment, they have to do in Inverness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now reopen a point which I mentioned at Second Reading, namely, what is meant by the term
	<br><blockquote><p>"ordinarily resident at the time of the birth"?</p></blockquote>
For example, if a woman has been in rooms for three months, is that her ordinary place of residence? Or if a couple, let us say, moved into a new home three weeks before the birth, is that their ordinary place of residence? It seems to me there could be dispute about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second point which I think could present difficulty is, if a registration can be effected in two places, how is it absolutely certain that it will be done at all? One of two things may happen. Either the mother and the father may, with the best intentions in the world, think that the other will register the child, each in a different district. The father, having had a conversation with his wife in the Simpson Hospital in Edinburgh, may say, "I will register the child in the registrar's office nearest to the Simpson on my way home this evening." He might forget to tell the mother that he had done it, and the mother might register the child when she got home to the ordinary place of residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
This is not a matter of great difficulty because I suspect that a duplicate copy would probably get caught up when it arrived in the General Register Office and the two duplicates were under scrutiny. On the other hand, suppose that each parent thought that the other had registered the child. The mother might think that the father had done it in the Edinburgh registrar's office and therefore did not bother about doing it at home and the father, being absentminded, might forget to do it, with the result that no registration is made. What then happens?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State could confirm this point. In Clause 49 there is at least the suggestion that the matron supplies to the local register office a list of the babies born in the hospital. There could probably therefore be coverage in that way. But suppose that the baby was born not in one's own home but in the home of friends. In that case there is not a matron to supply the local register office with the details. It is possible that no registration will take place. What happens then?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, it seems to me that difficulty will arise in later life when, say, a boy is going into the Armed Forces and the birth certificate, as so often happens, has been lost and nobody can find it. Therefore, the parents say, "We must get another". At the moment, there is no question about where that birth certificate is: it is in the register office in the place where the child was born. But, under the new legislation, this can be in one of two places. It may well be that 18 years afterwards the parents might have to scratch their heads to remember, not only in which of the two places they had registered the boy, but where they were living when he was born, particularly if the father is in a job which involves his moving about fairly often—and there are many people who change their homes every three or four years. This is a practical difficulty about which we must think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) mentioned the Civil Aviation Act, and I am sure that he will develop his point if he catches your eye again, Mr. Lever. I should like to return to the matter which we mentioned at Second Reading and to which the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Lady the Under-Secretary of State has shown herself extremely sympathetic, namely, the situation which will obtain under the new legislation in the Border counties. May I give three examples of what can happen? Take, first, a baby born in Berwick-upon-Tweed of parents who live there. It can be registered in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Land's End, Dover, or anywhere else in England or Wales where the parents might care to do it. That is the law of England, and I realise that I must not expand on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, say that a baby is born five miles out of Berwick, in Eyemouth, of parents who live elsewhere in Scotland. That baby can be registered either in Eyemouth or wherever the mother's ordinary place of residence is in Scotland. Thirdly, take the baby born in Berwick of parents who live in Eyemouth. That baby can be registered in only one place, namely Berwick-upon-Tweed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a quite distinct anomaly. I repeat that there are many people who want their babies to be registered in Scotland. They make great efforts to have them in Scotland so that they can be registered in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no lack of good will on the part of the Under-Secretary of State in trying to solve this problem. However, during the debates in another place on this matter, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland founded his objection on what he described as "difficulties", not impossibilities. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us look at what we should have to do if the Amendment were accepted".</p></blockquote>
This was an Amendment to try to regularise the two registration systems. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot say this would be applicable only to parents living in Berwickshire or Dumfriesshire. There could be a variety of other circumstances in which it might well be possible for somebody who lived in the Shetlands and who had a child born across the Border and wished to have this declaration system"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the English system—
	<br><blockquote><p>"applied. In order to make it possible of implementation we must make direct declaration forms available to every one of the registration districts throughout the whole of Scotland—and there are 950 of these. It would be very confusing to them, because many of them would have these forms and would have no occasion to use them from one decade to another … There are 1,500 registration districts on the English side of the Border, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
each of these would require instructions to accept a declaration form from Scotland, which would not necessarily be the same as the forms they have (though it might be possible to make them the same). Copies would have to be kept in every one of the 1,500 registration districts, and the arrangement would require statutory authority covering both countries. … I rest my case, not on the impossibility of altering English law in this Bill of our own (because while it may not be the best way to do it, it can be done)"—</p></blockquote>
I am doubtful about whether the noble Lord was right in saying that it could be done under this Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probably it could have been done in that place, but not in the Scottish Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may well be right. The noble Lord continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but on the fact that we would have to go through all this cumbersome procedure in order to deal with something like 100 cases in the course of a year. Even though the number is so small, I would not have resisted it if it could be accomplished with any sort of reasonable machinery, but to go to all this extraordinary bother for this comparatively small number and in an area where the districts are not very difficult is the reverse of reasonable. It would involve the Registrar General and myself starting a battle with the Registrar General in England in order to get his agreement, which would mean his enlisting on his side the English cohorts, and I do not think the game is worth the candle".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>House of Lords,</i> 25th February, 1965; Vol. 263, c. 996–7.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady echoed this very much at Second Reading. She said that she would discuss the matter with her colleagues. Has she done so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I want to say on the Civil Aviation procedure is that it is perfectly possible for the Ministry of Aviation to transmit these records to the Registrar General in Scotland. I repeat what I said earlier, that we must try to ensure that when the time comes, as I am sure it will come, there is legislation ensuring that the English and Scottish systems are synchronised. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries gave one or two examples at Second Reading which apply perhaps more to what I would describe as the absurdity in the registration of deaths in the Border counties. I think that in this day and age we should provide ourselves with equipment to enable us to fall into line and get rid of these rather ridiculous anomalies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of cooperation in the Committee, I am told
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
that it is better to raise the point that I wish to raise on this Clause rather than Clause 14. I will not repeat what I said at Second Reading or what my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has said today. However, this is a real problem in the Border counties, and no one in the Committee can feel that that is not the case. The distances can be quite great. My hon. Friend mentioned Eyemouth, but a maternity home or hospital may well be 25, 30, 40 or 45 miles from Carlisle, about which I am thinking particularly. Accidents occur and there can be misjudgments about timing. Children who, parents hoped, would be born in Scotland are born in England because, perhaps, the parents missed the last bus. However, the more normal case is for the ambulance to go direct with the mother to hospital in England. As my hon. Friend said, children that are born in England can be registered in the place of birth or at home in England. Under the Bill, exactly the same procedure applies to Scotland, but we seem to be at an impasse in jumping over the Border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we all agree, this is a Bill which primarily performs two functions—one for the convenience of the public and another for ensuring that registration is absolutely watertight. Here is a case of convenience to the public. If a mother and father overlook the registration of a child before they leave Carlisle, they may be back home in Scotland 30 or 40 miles away with a very inconvenient return trip for registration. We mentioned on Second Reading the great desire of Scots to be registered in Scotland, and we should try to assist the implementation of this desire if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard what the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, said in another place about the administrative difficulties. I do not think that we should allow the figures which he gave to the effect that there are 950 offices in Scotland and 1,500 in England to blind us because if parents—and we agree that there will not be many—particularly want to register the birth of their babies in Scotland the local registrar can write to Edinburgh for the form. I do not see any necessity to keep dozens of forms in these over 2,000 offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
In this handbook of registrars, and particularly in the section dealing with marriages concerning the case when one party is resident in Scotland and the case when neither party is resident in Scotland, there must be a great deal of coming and going and co-operation between the Registrar General in Scotland and the Registrar General in England. Surely we could get some agreement between the two Registrar Generals accepting some form of procedure that would allow this act of registration in Scotland to take place? It is possible under the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, as amended by the 1949 Act, to do just what I wish to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Lady to give us her advice and help on this problem. I know she has been doing research and I hope she may have found some solution. As my hon. Friend said, I am certain that if we wait for English legislation we shall fall between two stools and never get this sorted out in the next five centuries or 700 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised and I will take the more detailed ones first and move on to the substantial point of the new Border question, as I think this has come to be called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the possible difficulties which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) thought might occur as a result of the new provision which allows a birth to be registered in either of two places. I agree with him it is a substantial move forward in the extent of the convenience it will bring to many people. I do not think there are going to be the kind of difficulties which he envisaged. He asked whether there would not be a tendency for confusion on what was the usual place of residence. What "ordinarily resident" means is, of course, the usual residence at the time of birth. This can be interpreted in accordance with the circumstances. Obviously, we cannot lay down general rules about this. For example, there might be a woman who was living temporarily with her mother or a neighbour at the time of birth. There might be another where three months was a pretty permanent residence intending to lead on to a much longer period. So here it has to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
judged in the light of what the circumstances seem to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now what about the dangers that parents may in their excitement and confusion either fail to register the birth at all or register it twice over? These risks are really no greater under the Bill than they are at the moment, because both the mother and the father could each assume that the other was registering the birth and both fail to do so on that understanding. This can happen now when a birth may be only registered in one place. The danger is not much greater when it can be registered in two places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to dual registration, steps are going to be taken to make sure that we can know if this is likely to occur and can do something about it. The hon. Gentleman will see in Clause 14 that if this should happen, steps can be taken to make sure the registration only appears permanently in one register. As to the failure to register at all, again this applies now, but there are inducements which mean that very few people do fail to register a birth. Such things as maternity benefits and family allowances stem from the registration of a birth, so I think this is not a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about a case where, perhaps many years later, a boy might want to go back and look at or get a copy of his birth certificate and not be sure where the place of registration was if it was not the home he was living in all those years ago. The answer is in the facilities for search provided by the Registrar General in Edinburgh. When I visited Register House a week or two ago I tested for myself the efficiency with which one can so easily trace a record. I looked up simply the year of my younger son's birth and his name, and that is all that is needed—just the name and year of birth—and one can get there the reference to the exact point in the register where the thing is. So there is no difficulty here either, in view of the facilities which the Registrar General can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now can I turn to the more substantial point raised by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West and with which I have a great deal of sympathy? In relation to what was said in another place, both Lord Hughes and I share the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
same view that it would be admirable if we could find a way of dealing with this problem. We have been looking at it closely during the course of the Bill and we both agree that the problem is considerable and a very deep one to those whom it affects. That is why I said what I did at Second Reading—that I proposed to look at this with my colleagues in England who come into the picture, because of the need, as the hon. Gentleman recognises, to synchronise what happens in England and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked how far this had gone. We are proceeding with this, but it is a complex subject, finding a way of helping and looking at whether a way can be found. This is not a matter that can be done in even a few weeks. We are pursuing this, and as soon as we reach any conclusion we shall let the House know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, for I would not like the feeling to be left that nothing at all was being done while we were looking at the possibility of achieving something on a United Kingdom basis, the Registrar Generals have both said that they will do all they can administratively to ease some of the difficulties encountered by parents or relatives in registering over the Border births. Very often these difficulties arise, and I think the hon. Member for Dumfries would probably agree, because a father or another relative comes to visit the mother while in hospital in England, in Carlisle perhaps, without being told in advance where or when the registrar is to be found. Difficulties may also arise because fathers and mothers may not know there are alternative informants to register the birth if they are not able to do so. In other words, no one tells them what the position is. What is being arranged by the Registrar Generals is that local information of this sort is to be given to the mother or father through the English hospitals where the children of over the Border parents are most likely to be born. Similar information will be made available in the registration offices on the Scottish side of the Border, so that if the father or another relative inquires about procedure it can be easily supplied. This should mean that the father coming to visit his wife in hospital in Carlisle will have available to him information about where to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
register the birth and he will be told who the alternative informants may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope these arrangements will do a great deal to reduce the number of cases in which there is a genuine difficulty. That is not to say we are not going to carry on looking at this much more complicated matter of seeing if legislatively it may be possible to do something about this in more general terms so that administrative arrangements do not have to do a rescue operation for legislation that does not help the matter at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have answered all the points raised, but if there are any others perhaps hon. Members would remind me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether I have this matter clear and if not I apologise for my obtuseness.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend will find this point clarified in Clause 14 and in particular by the Amendments we shall be considering on that Clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because I have been scanning the next Clause, which it would be out of order to discuss now.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very good Clause. My own constituency has been referred to. There it will give a great deal of satisfaction, because many

The object of Amendment No. 33 is to make it unnecessary for both father and mother to attend the registration office but to put the responsibility on one or the other. So far as Amendment No. 34 goes, my own feeling is that other relatives should only come into this matter if the parents are quite unable to do it. That perhaps meets the point made by the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), that it is primarily the responsibility of the parents, that one parent to do it is adequate, and that only if neither of the parents is able to do it for any reason then it becomes the responsibility of other people of qualified abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I tremble to ask the Committee to believe that this, too, is just a drafting Amendment, because it looks so complicated, but, in fact, we feel that the Clause as drawn is slightly clumsy and the same effect can be more simply achieved by making the change which we propose.

	<li>in the case of the death or inability of the father and mother"—</li>

there then following these four categories of person, being required within 21 days to attend personally at the registration office. That is all it amounts to, and I think that it would give a more positive and direct approach to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman's intention is to improve the drafting and achieve brevity. It seems to me, however, to make subsection (1) a shade clumsier to read, although that is probably a matter of opinion.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The description of the first alternative informant is ambiguous. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"any relative of either parent who has knowledge of the birth"</p></blockquote>
could refer to a relative who has knowledge of the birth or a parent who has knowledge of the birth. What the Clause as drafted does—in subsection (2,	<i>a</i>)—is to make the matter quite clear by referring to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any relative of either parent of the child, being a relative who has knowledge of the birth"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
In the course of redrafting, the word "qualified" in relation to an informant has been dropped. This is a little inconvenient because the term "qualified informant" is already in use in administration, and it is used in several later Clauses as well as being defined in Clause 55 in a way which fits in with Clause 14 as at present drafted.

Therefore, while accepting the hon. Gentleman's intention, I must tell him that there are difficulties in accepting the Amendment which outweighs the shortening which it would achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member wish to withdraw the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed at that reply, although I recognise the point which the hon. Lady made about the ambiguity in the first line of the Amendment. I hope that she will forgive me if I tell her frankly that I do not agree, apart from that point, that this would not be a better way of letting people understand the Clause. From something she said at Second Reading I am sure that she is anxious to have a Bill which is as clear and lucid as possible. Therefore, without asking for any commitment now, I hope that she will glance through the Clause against between now and Report and consider whether it would be worth while at least accepting the pattern of our Amendment and adapting it for what I should regard as a better result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I beg to ask leave to with draw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is something in what the hon. Gentleman said. I fail to see the difference between
	<br><blockquote><p>"any relative of either parent of the child, being a relative who has knowledge of the birth"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"any relative of either parent who has knowledge of the birth".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that proper use of the pronoun is made here, and we do not want to enter upon an exercise in the English language. After acceptance of that point, the rest would follow in more intelligible layman's language instead of legal phraseology. I hope that my hon. Friend will look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I think that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State is right. I feel almost back in a professional capacity here, but I must agree that the first line of the Amendment is somewhat ambiguous. If anything, it would refer to the parent who has knowledge of the birth. I wonder whether, for the sake of clarity, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State would consider the possibility of inserting a comma before "of either parent" and a comma after it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 36, and I think that it will be convenient to discuss with it the following four Amendments: No. 39, in Clause 15, page 10, line 9, to leave out "before the expiration of" and to insert "within"; and Nos. 48, 69, and 70, all to the same effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 36, in page 9, line 22, to leave out from the beginning to "twenty-one" and to insert "within".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this Amendment is to use the more common language of the breakfast table instead of talking about
	<br><blockquote><p>"before the expiration of a period of twenty-one days".</p></blockquote>
I hope that I shall have the hon. Lady's support here, because I can hardly imagine her legal advisers finding very much objection to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept this Amendment and the others which follow from it. Perhaps I may say a word about this kind of drafting Amendment. In a Consolidation Bill, when the substantive legislation on which one is basing one's consideration is Victorian, eighteen-fifty-ish, the words tend to become too familiar, so that one does not have a clear, eagle-eyed critical approach towards every phrase. As soon as one's attention is drawn to these points, one realises that it is splendid to cut out the Victoriana and introduce a note of the nineteen-sixties. I am very ready to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>Clause 16.—(REGISTRAR'S POWER TO REQUIRE INFORMATION CONCERNING BIRTH TO BE GIVEN.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that a reasonable case can be made out for a qualified informant being paid his expenses if it is found necessary to summon him to attend personally at the registration office. It is not impossible that a qualified informant may have to travel a fairly long way. If the parents, who have the first responsibility, have not shouldered it, and have left the country—they may have sailed off to India after having had the baby a week or two before—the next responsibility is on the occupier of the premises in which the birth took place. Nowadays, it is not impossible that the house in which the birth took place, the parents having gone off to India, remains empty, with no one in it at all. Again, someone else present at the birth may be a relative who came up for the occasion from the south of England and who has returned home. If such a person has to travel to Scotland because others higher on the list have failed to honour their responsibility, is there not a case for expenses being paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I have a question merely for the purpose of information. Can a notice to attend a registrar's office in Scotland be served and a decree enforced on someone who happens to be in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a simpler way out? Would it not be possible for telephone communication to be made between registration offices, it being arranged for the informant to provide the information to the registrar in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
district in which he resides? That would avoid any question of expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that, almost inevitably, on every occasion, the qualified informant who is called in is someone who has failed in his duty. If an informant lives at a distance, the notice will be served, if possible, on another informant who lives nearby. It is only 	<i>in extremis,</i> as it were, that one calls in an informant who lives a distance away, and it is then inevitable because he has not really done all he ought to have done at the time. In effect, he has only himself to blame if he has to travel a considerable distance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of expenses, the difficulty here is that it would be rather unfair to informants who come forward voluntarily to suggest that expenses
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
should be paid to informants who have, as it were, to be dragged screaming to the registrar's office to fulfil the proper duty which they ought to have fulfilled anyway. In other words, what one would be saying, if at all, is that we ought to pay expenses to all informants whether they come voluntarily or have to be asked to come. That would hardly seem right, and I do not think that it is a practical possibility to make the change suggested.
