	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That during the proceedings on the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.â€”	<i>[Mr. Ross.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></q>
The Bill makes a considerableâ€”indeed, a majorâ€”change concerning one of the most important aspects of Scottish education: that of the entry into teaching, and the regulations in relation to the education and training of entrants, which at present is controlled by the Secretary of State and which, after the passing of the Bill, will in great measure pass to the teaching profession through the establishment of a Teaching Council. This is a far-reaching change. It is not merely a device to give status to Scottish teachers, as some people have suggested, but is one which recognises the status of teachers and their ability to accept new responsibilities in regard to their profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Wheatley Committee and to Lord Wheatley himself, whose Report is the basis of the Bill. Lord Wheatley has said that the Committee was in some respects an unusual one. Apart from the three independent members, each of whom, I am sure, made a valuable contribution, the membership was made up of the interests most closely concerned with education. We therefore had knowledge and experience, men who, as Lord Wheatley says in his Report, started with preconceived ideas about the problem, and yet every one of whom moved from those preconceived ideas towards general agreement. The degree of unanimity
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
which was reached, bearing in mind the nature of the body, is a tribute in itself to their realism and to Lord Wheatley in guiding the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought, and I have made no great secret of the fact, that the Wheatley Report merited action by the Government, and I have made it my business to bring forward the Bill as quickly as possible to give effect to the Committee's recommendations. It is nearly two years since the Wheatley Report was laid before the House in May, 1963, and the Committee's work started earlier than that. I propose to say something about the context in which the Wheatley Committee was appointed and about the role of the teaching profession in the shaping of educational policy. Then I should like to look at the situation confronting us today in teacher supply, which undoubtedly is one of our most serious problems and one which underlies the Bill. Then I should like to deal with the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us, on both sides, will recall the circumstances in May, 1961, which led to the setting up of the Wheatley Committee. In that month, we had a debate in this Committee Room. Teaching in those days was in a ferment. Many of us remember it as Members of Parliament. There are some who remember it as teachers actively involved in the discussions of that time. I think that the morale of the teaching profession was never lower. Those in the profession felt that they had been forgotten and had lost status Everything culminated in and boiled up over two special problems: that of salaries at that time, and that of a feeling that dilution would be thrust upon the profession. The result was that we had a strike in Glasgow. The feelings of many of the people in Glasgow at that time were shared elsewhere in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was in those circumstances and to get out of that difficulty that the then Secretary of State, now Viscount Muirshiel, suggested to the teachers that there should be a review of the outstanding problems. That led to the establishment of committees and subcommittees to look into these problems, and from that we have had quite good results in the way of legislation. The one big thing which came out, however, was the establishment of the Wheatley

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Committee, from which eventually came the Wheatley Report. Although I pay tribute to the former Government for what they did concerning some of the other problems, I have always regretted that they allowed all these months, spreading into years, to pass without taking action on what I thought was the central and most important partâ€”the Wheatley Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of things, the question of reviewing the existing arrangements for granting certificates to teachers would appear to be a purely technical matter. It is far from it, because it really means the whole problem of control of entry to teaching and the extent to which the profession itself can properly be given specific responsibilities in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley Committee not only did a thorough job, but it did a remarkable job, because it had to assess and make suggestions concerning the balance of interest between what might be called the professional interest and the public interest as represented by the Secretary of State. This careful assessment of legitimate professional interests and responsibilities of education authorities and the Secretary of State for the education service underlies the carefully calculated balance in the composition of the Teaching Council which the Committee recommended and which is enshrined in Clause 1 and in Schedule 1 of the Bill.

I want the Committee to bear in mind, particularly when we discuss the details of Clause 1 and the composition of the Council, that we are sticking fairly closely to what was laid down and carefully thought out by the Wheatley Committee concerning the interests already existing and the changes which we are making. In particular, the Wheatley Committee was at pains to acknowledge the statutory responsibilities of the Secretary of State. Whatever else can be done and whatever happens it cannot be gainsaid that the responsibility to the public and to Parliament remains statutorily in the hands of the Secretary of State. That being so, he must retain in any changes power to exercise that responsibility. This is fundamental and, I think, is recognised by the teaching profession. Certainly it was recognised by the Wheatley Committee. The responsibilities to Parliament of myself or of any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
other Secretary of State are such that he must have the last word in such matters as the regulation of entry to teaching. How that is exercised is an entirely different matter. I am satisfied that we can build up trust, confidence and responsibility with the teachers to be able to give them this considerable measure of self-government. The point which I wish to make at this stage is that the Government's view is that the Committee's Report, resting as it does on an informed and balanced view of the realities of the situation, offers a sound and practical basis on which to build a new system for control of entry to the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be remembered that this is applicable only to Scotland. It is not the first time that Scotland has pioneered in education, and I hope that it will not be the last. It is a matter to our creditâ€”and I feel that I speak for the whole Committeeâ€”that we are prepared to make this change, far reaching as it is, and give a unique place to the teaching profession in Scotland. It is for this reason that we come forward with the Bill, embodying practically all the specific recommendations of the Wheatley Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 57 of its Report, the Wheatley Committee stated:
	<br><q><p>"â€¦we think that the time has now come when a further advance should be made in the process which has been taking place in recent years of giving the teaching profession an increased measure of responsibility in matters which are of prime concern to it."</p></q>
I think that is right. That is why we are setting up the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been in recent years a gradual change in the process under which teachers as a body have come to play a greater part in shaping educational policy and participating in educational decisions. As one who has been a teacher, I greatly welcome this. As Secretary of State, I think it is essential to ordered progress in education that we should work in harmony and co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The teachers have, for example, played a valuable part in the work of the Advisory Council. That is a body which will disappear with the growth and development of the new Teaching Council. In more recent times they have participated in a great many committees and working parties dealing with specific problems, and there has been a greater recognition of the need to bring teachers into consultation on educational policy, not only at a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
national level, but also at a local level. Teachersâ€”and this is where they differ from those south of the Borderâ€”have played a considerable part in the actual governance of our colleges of education. In fact, they have representatives there. This is a change and an advance which we made some time ago as between the two countries. In addition, teachers directly elected by their colleagues to those bodies will, I hope, continue to play the same kind of part within the new Council. The party opposite, to its credit, played its part in this development, but I am disappointed that it stopped short of the one big decision to legislate for the Wheatley Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Teaching Council comes to be set upâ€”and I hope that we shall be able to proceed with this as rapidly as possibleâ€”the timetable, as I see it, is that we shall get the Bill through by the summer, we shall be able to set up the Council by September, it should be in a position to start exercising its authority in January, 1966, and take over my responsibilities thereafter. In about April I will hand over those of my responsibilities that I am allowing to lapse. At that time, the Scottish Council should go and the new Teaching Council should then be in full control. I hope we can accept this as reasonable progress towards its establishment and bringing it into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the new Council in being, the teachers in Scotland will have what can fairly be called a unique measure of self-government. As the profession itself acknowledges, this involves new responsibilities as well as new powers. Power without responsibility is tyranny, and the last place we want tyranny is in Scottish education. There may be cynics, as I have said, who think that this is merely a device for giving status to teachers. In my opinion, that is a misplaced view of what has been happening and of the coming together which has taken place between those responsible for educational policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have every reason to think that Scottish teachers will welcome their new responsibilities and will act responsibly and with a full realisation of the future needs of the education service and of our country and of the paramount needs of our children. It is not the Government who matter, it is not the teachers who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
matter, in education: it is the children who matter. If we lose sight of the needs of our children in modern education, we shall not get any of our problems right and we shall all lose the respect of the public. Status depends eventually on the public, not on what we think of ourselves, but on what the public think of us and whether we are meeting our responsibilities. There are great opportunities in all this for the teaching profession, and, as I have said in my last sentence or two, there are challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The most critical problem to be dealt with, and quickly, is the problem of teacher supply, and we shall not be able to do this without the co-operation of the teachers. This is basic to what we are doing here. I do not want to stray too far from the theme of the Bill, but it would be quite unrealistic if I did not say something about this problem. We had a very good debate on the subject last night, and I am sorry that quite a number of hon. Members were not there. We had the opportunity, quite unexpectedly, to deal with this very problem for about an hour and a quarter last night, and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) is to be congratulated for having seized the chance to raise the subject and initiate a debate. I am sorry that, given the opportunity, hon. Members opposite did not let us know what they felt about it. It was "Michael the Silent" last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman be good enough to explain that I asked to come in, but his hon.

[HON. MEMBERS: "Well then?"] My hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston spoke, and, when he sat down, no one rose on the opposite side. Then my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) spoke, and after him nobody rose on the opposite benches. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Woodside (Mr. Carmichael) followed him, and it was only after that, when time was slipping away, that the right hon. Gentleman passed over his note. My

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said that, if she had enough time, she would gladly give the right hon. Gentleman the five minutes he wanted, but he should have taken his opportunity when it was there. However, that is by the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to give too many figures nowâ€”many of them were given last nightâ€”but the fact is that, in October last, the education authorities estimated that they needed 3,600 teachers to fill vacancies, to enable them to get rid of uncertificated teachers and to give the kind of teaching coverage which we regard as minimum. That is the shortage just now. If we do nothing about anything else, this shortage will disappear by 1970. But, of course, the previous Government decided to raise the school-leaving age in 1970â€“71, and this will call for more teachers. It means that all pupils will stay on till 16 instead of leaving at 15 as they can do now, and the immediate consequence will be a shortage of teachers in 1970 of about 4,000. This will be without doing anything at all to reduce the size of classes, and the size of classes in Scotland is higher than the permitted maximum in England. Therefore, even though we overcome the one problem and get the extra 4,000 teachers in 1970, in order to solve the problem of the size of classes to the extent of giving us parity with England and Wales, we shall need another 3,000 teachers by 1975, and if we wanted to reduce the size of classes to 30 the shortage would be about 10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the extent of the problem, and I was disappointed in the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) last night because, while my hon. Friend was speaking, he sat there laughing. It was his Government who decided to raise the school-leaving age, and he, as Secretary of State, ought to have known that it takes at least three to five years to make a teacher. This is why time is not on our side. We cannot wave a wand and make thousands of teachers appear. The right hon. Gentleman should have been ready at that time with ways and means of meeting the problem as it came. Let us not, therefore, think that setting up a Teaching Council is all we need to do. We cannot allow even a year to pass without pressing ahead,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
and I hope that there will be general recognition of this by everyone concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been speaking about numbers of teachers, but it is not really with the number of teachers that we can properly begin. Those who will go to swell the schools in 1970â€“71 will be the pupils who today are leaving at 15, and the pupils who are leaving today at 15 are pretty dissatisfied with the education which we are giving them in their secondary courses now. Therefore, in considering the kind of education we want, we have to relate our thoughts to the kind of teacher we want. The kind of teacher we want must be related to the qualifications of teachers. Here we come to the real problem before us of working out exactly what is needed in relation to the kind of teachers, the number of teachers and the kind of education which we must give. All these considerations are closely knit together. We must see to it that we have the right kind of teacher to meet the needs of the pupils, not just the needs of the schools. It is important, for example, to have more men teachers in the primary schools in the interest of stability in staffing and the continuity of teaching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend agree also that the question of the kind of teacher and the kind of pupil is intimately related to the question of the school buildings in which they will be housed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, this is true also. All these things are related, and the question of the kind of buildings is related to the kind of education that one gives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am thinking particularly of the imperative need to devise courses of secondary education for pupils who are not academic but who still deserve the best in education that we can give them, an education which will interest them. I am speaking of the pupils who used to be called junior secondary material, a term which is rather misleading and which would be best forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Brunton Working Party Report has given a major lead in this direction, and the welcome it has received and the response it has evoked from education authorities and teachers give grounds for thinking that we can expect to make real headway in secondary education, not least by getting far more varied, more interesting and more life-relatedâ€”call
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
them vocational if you likeâ€”courses. With the raising of the school-leaving age in the offing, the need for effective progress in this direction is all the greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can make headway only if we have the right kinds of teachers in the right numbers. There have been suggestionsâ€”we canvassed them last night, and my hon. Friend spoke about the review which is taking placeâ€”for short-term measures, bringing back more retired teachers, having special recruitment arrangements, getting back more married women teachers into the profession, and so on. There have been suggestions that we should pay more. I wish that this were the solution, but I do not think that it is as easy as that. We are concerned here with competing demands for a limited number of qualified people, and, fundamentally, what we must do is increase as much as we possibly can the pool of people on which we can draw, trying to ensure that teaching continues to secure its proportionâ€”and, if possible, an increased proportionâ€”of those who are capable and qualified for the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these suggestions are reasonable in themselves, but we must recognise that, even at best, we might still be left with a considerable shortage. Therefore, although I do not exclude action on these short-term measures, as my hon. Friend said last night, a realistic attitude towards the long-term measures must remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However successful we may be in trying to seek a solution in this way, any additional recruitment which might be obtained will not solve our 1970 problem. So it is against this background that we must consider whether new sources of recruitment can be found and what kind of teachers we really need. We must examine how far industrial or commercial experience is of value to teachers of this kind. This is a field which we can explore and from which we may be able to obtain qualified and capable people in order to deal with the new problem in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to consider very carefully whether we can find new sources of recruitment. A great deal of thought is being given to this question now. I have met the teachers myself on more than one occasion, and I have no wish to offer solutions just now because they are matters which must be worked out, but there are proposals now under discussion
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
in the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers and with the teachers' associations. We have not reached the point of decision, but, remembering the time scale, we must realise that this is not something which can be just put off, with the idea that we can let the Teaching Council deal with it. We cannot afford to waste a year. Indeed, in my view, we cannot afford to waste a month if we are to be in a position realistically to deal with the situation in 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that suggestions for change in the training system are liable to give rise to misgivings in some quarters. In bringing forward the Bill, we are, for our part, giving an earnest of our intention to entrust the teaching profession with a substantial measure of responsibility, and we feel justified, therefore, in asking the teachers to take a realistic and dispassionate view of the situation, as they did when they embarked on their deliberations on the Wheatley Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few words now about the Bill itself. An important task of the Council will be to establish a register of teachers to take the place of the existing arrangements under which teachers are certificated by the Secretary of State. Even more important in some ways will be the Council's functions as regards entry to teaching. The question of registration is covered by Clauses 6 and 8. The main Clauses establishing the Council and its functions are Clauses 1 and 2, together with Schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Teaching Council will consist of 44 members, 21 of them directly elected by the teachers. There will be four teachers elected from among themselves by the principals of the colleges of education. This will give 25 teachers. There will be 13 members from the education authorities and educational institutions, higher education establishments and the like, and six appointed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that hon. Members have been receiving letters about this, and so have I. But if we acceded to all the requests of people who have said that they have a special interest, it would be a Council not of 44 members but of about 78. We have to bear this in mind, and this is why I think that we were right in sticking fairly closely to Wheatley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions of the Council will be to review the standards for entry into the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
teaching profession and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State as regards the incorporation of these standards in regulations under Clause 7 of the Bill. Another function, under Clause 3, will be to advise the Secretary of State about teacher supply. This is a function exercised at present by the Scottish Council. As regards teacher supply, we specifically say that this function will not cover salaries and the like because such questions are already dealt with by the Scottish Joint Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 5, the Council will keep itself informed about the work of the colleges of education, but not to the extent of interfering in the day-to-day work and routine of the colleges. Clauses 6 and 8, as I have said, deal with the responsibility for establishing and maintaining a system of registration of teachers. At present, it is the Secretary of State who grants the certificate, what we in the profession used to call the parchment, to the teacher. In future, this will be a matter for the Council in relation to registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of establishing standards, Principal Appleton pointed out that, if one raises the standard of teachers and continues to raise it, one constantly reduces the pool.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly true, but I think my right hon. Friend is probably confusing two things in relation to standards. He is confusing academic standards, and probably standards in relation to ability to teach, which is the actual training of teachers. We do not want to see a reduction of standards of competency and ability to teach. It may well be that we have tended to underplay the aspect of training and of being trained for the actual job to be done. I am perfectly sure that the profession has this in mind, as also has the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has said that we have received dozens of letters. We have, and outstanding among them are two letters, one from the Roman Catholic hierarchy,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
and one from the Church of Scotland who have traditional associations with education and training of teachers. Will my right hon. Friend clear the air a little by saying what his position is to be in respect of these representations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position laid down by Wheatley, which we followed was that when it comes to the six nominated members what the Secretary of State has to bear in mind is the position as it turns out after the elections. The Roman Catholic Church said, and in this it was repeating what was stated in one of the paragraphs of the Wheatley Report, that it is very likely that as a result of the election by the principals of the training colleges one of them may well be a member from one of the Roman Catholic colleges. The Wheatley Committee suggested that the Secretary of State should bear in mind considerations in relation to the Church of Scotland in the appointment of one of the other members. There is no change in relation to the participation of the Churches in respect of colleges of education, or in respect of local authority work, or the interests of the Churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is not causing anybody to lose its say in these matters. The Secretary of State is giving up his responsibilities, and giving them in great measure, to the teaching profession itself. At the same time he is reorganising his advisory body, the Advisory Council on Teaching on which the Churches are not presently represented. I can assure my hon. Friend that I shall bear in mind the recommendations of Wheatley, I shall also take into account representations made to us by the Churches. We can consider this at greater length in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we should allow it to pass that the assumption is that the representative of a college of education, being a Roman Catholic, should represent two points of view. I think there will be undoubtedly opportunity to discuss this later, and no doubt many of us would wish to do so, but I think the Secretary of State would surely, even at this stage, agree that it is unreasonable in this day and generation to accept an elected representative whose responsibilities are to carry the point of view of his college but also to represent the particular point of view which may be that of one or other Church.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be careful about this, because we are getting down to the fundamental aspects of the Council. I hope that people who become members of the Council will not be representatives or delegates at all. If we are asking them to take a balanced viewâ€”this was basic to what happened in the Wheatley Committee itselfâ€”they must be prepared to look at the overall situation and to see it as individuals and not as delegates. It is their experience and knowledge which they are bringing in. To my mind they will not be there as delegates. There would be a misconception if we regarded this Council as purely a collection of delegates. We would then not get the kind of progress and the kind of Council which we want in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 10 to 12 deal with disciplinary powers. These are important. Although they may bulk large in the Bill, I hope that they will not be exercised to any great extent. The Secretary of State himself has these powers at present and I am glad to say that he does not exercise them all that much. It is essential to safeguard the interests of the profession and to see that we safeguard also the interests of the individual. So we make provision for two sub-committees, an Investigating Committee which will establish whether or not there is a 	<i>prima facie</i> case for taking action, and a Disciplinary Committee which will itself take the action. Of course, they will be strictly limited in relation to how they act, although there is a certain amount of latitude by the words, "infamous conduct", which are not strictly defined. The rules have to be approved by the Lord President of the Court of Session and there is a right of appeal to the Court of Session on the right of registration, if it is withdrawn. This is as it should be. I think we have here, together with the continuing powers of looking at the question of training, discipline and entry, a fair division of responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to take so long, but I now come to one of the last Clauses, Clause 7. Under this the regulations are made. We have not entirely followed the Wheatley Committee in this respect. The Wheatley Committee said that in all cases where disagreement arose, whereas normally cases would be dealt with on the basis of the negative resolution procedure, if disagreement arose it should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
be dealt with under the affirmative resolution procedure of both Houses, or through fresh legislation. I think we can rule out fresh legislation, because Governments do not put into Bills provision for fresh legislation except in particular cases. Of course, fresh legislation is never entirely ruled out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding here. It may be that Lord Wheatley had been too long away from this House. Regulations and orders are legislation, delegated legislation, but they certainly do not make the same demands on the time of the House of Commons as does other legislation. They are very much easier to introduce and to get through because of that fact. When It comes to the question of whether or not we should proceed by way of affirmative resolution, I think it very difficult to justify providing that the orders should be dealt with by one procedure or by another, not in relation to the importance or nature of the regulations but simply by reference to whether or not there was agreement or disagreement. From all points of view, bearing in mind that I do not foresee disagreement arising very oftenâ€”I hope not at all, but that will depend on the nature of the Council itself and of the problemsâ€”we should rest upon the new procedure we have devised. While we should have the negative procedure where there is disagreement, the nature of the advice given by the Council to the Secretary of State which is not being accepted should itself be made public at the same time. The reasons for the Secretary of State not accepting that advice should also be made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to remember that the Wheatley Committee suggested that it was advisable to make this change in relation to the type of resolution for the simple reason that Lord Wheatley wanted disputes brought into public controversy whereas things tended to be slipped through because it was up to an hon. Member to put down a Prayer. I think we achieve this by this new procedure. It may be that we shall have to look at it again in Committee, but to my mind this is a satisfactory, adjusted balance of the responsibilities which are to be borne.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the reason, perhaps, why some of us may be a

little cynical about the negative resolution procedure, it having a terrible finality about it, that this has not been successful, according to my information, since the gypsum rock prices Order, in July, 1951? In fact, only seven times in the last quarter of a century has it succeeded, and five of those times, hon. Members opposite might agree, were when it was used for political reasons during the Labour Government of 1950â€“51. Is it not a procedure to which one may pay lip service but which in the past has been shown not to carry much weight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend ignores a very simple fact. By the time a Government lay regulations, the Government have made up their mind and the Government usually have a majority. My hon. Friend said that it has not succeeded, but he means that the Government have not been defeated on the negative resolution. That is an actual fact. What we are concerned about here is getting agreement. If we fail to get agreement we should allow the public to be aware of the points of controversy. I think we meet this by making it public and making sure that the public and Members of Parliament know the points of controversy at an early stage. We tend to place far too much importance on the question of using one procedure or the other. For that reason, because of my confidence that we can make this work when there are disagreements, I suggest that we should rest on the innovation we have suggested in Clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley Committee recommended at the end of the day that reserve powers must be left with the Secretary of State over such matters as the standards of entry to the teaching profession. At the same time the Committee was anxious to see that the Council should be a body of standing whose views would not be lightly set aside. This is all-important. I think we secure this by the balance in Clause 7 where, if there is a disagreement, the reasons will be published, the Council's recommendations made public and the reasons for the Government not agreeing also made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that these and many other points will be raised in Committee
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
and also during this debate. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be very glad to give clarification of any points raised this morning. I think I have said enough to indicate the context in which we have put this Bill forward. I believe that the setting up of the Teaching Council will mark a great step forward for the teaching profession. I am confident that the teachers will show themselves capable of matching the opportunities which they are being offered. The Wheatley Committee said, in paragraph 59, that
	<br><q><p>"the progressive development of Scottish education depends on the co-operation of the teachers; it is right that their legitimate aspirations as a profession should be satisfied."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to join the Secretary of State in paying tribute to the work of Lord Wheatley and his Committee. We welcome the principle of this Bill, because it will enhance the status of the teaching profession. The right hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) and myself were the last to debate the Wheatley Report in the last Parliament, on 29th July, at 8 o'clock in the morning. She then regretted, as the Secretary of State did this morning, that when we had the responsibility of government we had not brought forward the Wheatley Report earlier, although the Secretary of State said this morning that he thought that we had and had done considerable work in improving education in Scotland.

There were two main reasons why we did not bring forward the Report earlier. The first was that since receiving the

Report, as the Secretary of State said, we had made the decision to raise the school-leaving age to 16 in 1970. Any Minister responsible to Parliament for the supply of teachers must, even with the safeguards recommended in the Wheatley Report, think deeply before, in the words of the Report, assenting to a real and substantial change in the balance of power between the Secretary of State and the Teaching Council concerning standards for entry into the teaching profession. The Report says in paragraph 7 that this subject
	<br><q><p>"was one of great difficulty and complexity, one on which hasty judgments are liable to be ill-advised".</p></q>
There is also the fact that there was no real need for haste because in paragraph 54 the Report says:
	<br><q><p>"We do not think that the case for such a transfer of functions can be argued on the ground that the existing arrangements, including essentially the certification of teachers by the Secretary of State, are defective or inefficient".</p></q>
The Report also pointed out that the influence which the teaching profession enjoyed in Scotland in teacher training was already substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have to consider why, in the end, the Wheatley Report recommended these changes, for two main reasons: first, that they would give the teaching profession effective opportunity for exercising responsibility; and, secondly, that they would do a great deal to enhance the general standing of the profession. As the Secretary of State rightly says, all this will depend on very close co-operation between the Government and the Teaching Council and the degree of responsibility exercised by those who will have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Secretary of State said that the Bill would make a major change, it gives the teaching profession not full self-government but only limited self-government. The crux of the matter is that there could be a conflict between the public interest to provide an adequate number of teachers and the professional interest to raise and maintain standards which may well have to change in a changing world, as was recognised this morning by the right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), who had responsibility for these matters at one time. I therefore suggest that the kernel of the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
lies in the powers of the proposed Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State explained that the Bill follows the Report closely in that it reserves substantial powers to the Secretary of State. As he said, the Bill goes further than the Report in what it does in Clause 7. But in the balance of power the Secretary of State keeps the right to frame the regulations under the Bill. The Teaching Council may make recommendations on standards of entry to the teaching profession which the Secretary of State may accept, modify with or without agreement, or reject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to certain of the main specific provisions, I should like briefly to say something about the composition of the Teaching Council, which has already been the subject of debate this morning. It is true that the First Schedule follows the Report closely. The Secretary of State pointed out that those who sit on the Council will sit not as representatives of their associations but as individuals for their experience and qualifications. Nevertheless, that does not mean that we in the House of Commons are not extremely interested in what is in the Secretary of State's mind concerning the six nominated members. I should like to ask the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State, when she replies, to tell us whether they include the two assessors, or whether these are to be additional without voting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and others raised the question of the Roman Catholic Church and one of my hon. Friends raised the question of the Church of Scotland. While I appreciate that there may well be a difference according to who is chosen, I think that there is considerable unease that the Church of Scotland shall not have a statutory right to have members on the Council. I am rather surprised that the Secretary of State has not written into the Bill provision to that effect. I remember very well the tremendous debates which we had on the Education (Scotland) Bill, 1963. We spent hours discussing the composition of the Examination Board and we had speech after speech from hon. Members opposite saying that the Bill should show who the Secretary of State's nominated members were. I am, therefore, surprised that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
in three short months the Secretary of State has adopted such a different attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of the members of the Council will hold a teacher's certificate. Twenty-one out of 44 shall be elected certificated teachers. I presume that the four members from the colleges of education chosen by the principals and the three directors of education will also hold a certificate. The four representatives from the universities and two from the central institutions may also hold teachers' certificates. Therefore, the professional interest is in the majority, although it is widely based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the past does not intervene in the question which I put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, but it does. Hon. Members opposite must understand that they have already got a pastâ€”and what a past!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that the noble Lady's party has no future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Clause 5, I am glad that the colleges of education are to keep their increasing autonomy. Concern has been expressed about Clause 5(3). If the Council considers that there should be some change in the content of a course and the governing body refuses to accept it, the Clause says that
	<br><q><p>"the Council may report the circumstances to the Secretary of State".</p></q>
The question has been raised as to whether this confers any authority on anybody. As I read it, the Clause leaves a residual power with the Secretary of State to direct, on the recommendation of the Council, the college of education to act in accordance with the recommenda-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
tion, because this was suggested in paragraph 117 of the Report. I should like the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State to say whether or not this is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 lays a duty on the Council to keep a register of teachers. I suppose that we shall have to get used to the disappearance of the term "certificated teacher" and to use instead the term "registered teacher". It is important to note that, as with the General Medical Council, the fact that a teacher is not on the register does not prevent him or her from teaching. It means, however, as is the case now, that a teacher cannot aspire to a permanent post with the financial and superannuation advantages which would be enjoyed by a registered teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6(2) is very important, and particularly paragraphs 	<i>(b)</i> and 	<i>(c).</i> I presume that this will apply to three different categories. First, those who may qualify in the new proposed four-year course at colleges of education now under discussion with the universities which would lead to a degree and a professional qualification, as recommended by the Robbins Committee. I am sure that hon. Members would be very interested to know what progress is being made in these discussions. I believe that it was hoped that two or three colleges would introduce this course in the session 1965â€“66. I should be very interested to know what the position is, because this matter affects Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category is those who have qualifications which are not of Scottish origin. The question of exceptional recognition as a teacher arouses, according to the Report, "strong feelings". I note that there is to be an appeal to the Council but not to the Secretary of State. There was an appeal to the Scottish Advisory Council, which will disappear in time. On behalf of my hon. Friends and myself, I should like to pay tribute to the work which the Advisory Council has done over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, presumably Clause 6(2) could apply to the admission of non-graduate men teaching general subjects in primary and secondary schools, as is the case in England and Wales. I should be glad to have confirmation of that point. In the past, this has been considered a delicate matter, but recent debates in the House and in the country, notably on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
the Brunton Report, have shown that, not only hon. Members, but also, I believe, leaders of educational opinion are fully aware that we need far more teachers who have a different background from that of those who come from the academic strata. After all, 65 per cent. of our children follow courses which do not lead to the Scottish Certificate of Education. Therefore, if the needs are different we are bound to consider again whether it is right that all men in Scotland intending to be teachers of general subjects should usually be university graduates before they start training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any teaching council charged with the responsibility to consider the supply of teachers and to make recommendations will, I am sure, look at this thorny question with fresh minds. For the pride which the profession naturally takes in its high standards of entry must surely be tempered by the wish to find men of quality and character who may well, in training, have much to give to a generation aware of and eager to meet modern trends. The Secretary of State said this morning that we need new sources of recruitment. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll, when he winds up, will wish to deal in greater detail with the question of supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the questions which I have mentioned can, under the Bill, either be considered, in the first instance, by the Council or referred to the Council by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the procedure for bringing into effect any change in the requirements for entry to the teaching profession, and particularly to Clause 7. It is here, as the Secretary of State has told us, that there is a major departure from the Wheatley Report's recommendations in paragraphs 104, 105 and 106. There it was recommended that if the Secretary of State wished to give effect to changes which had not been approved by the Teaching Council the recommendations would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and not, as is stated in the Bill, to the negative procedure. It therefore proposed that if there were a major issue at stake the Secretary of State should consider bringing in a Bill on each occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Secretary of State that we cannot support the suggestion
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
of the introduction of a Bill on each occasion. That, I think, goes too far, knowing the limitations on Parliamentary time. But I was most interested to see that the Government have not accepted the idea of the affirmative resolution procedure. It is perfectly true that Section 144 of the 1962 Act lays down that the regulations shall be subject to negative procedure. I rememberâ€”I have quite a good memoryâ€”the many debates which took place on Bills, when we were in Government and hon. Members opposite in Opposition, when they asked for the affirmative resolution procedure. I am absolutely staggered by the effect on them of 100 days of office. And what a hundred daysâ€”promises flung out of the window and also loudly proclaimed reliefs. On this matter I must pay public tribute to the persuasive power of the Scottish Department of Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which hon. Members opposite, when in Opposition, used to raise and pursue, at full cry and enormous length, was the question of power to legislate by regulation. Everything had to be put in a Billâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was your idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regulations, it was said, took away the right of Parliament to amend in detail, but we have had in this Parliament two education Bills which can function only if they are followed by a spate of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that this Bill contains an ingenious device. Instead of the affirmative resolution procedure it is now mandatory on the Secretary of State to publish a statement on his reasons for rejecting the Council's recommendations and to give any objections raised by the Council. I am sorry that when the Secretary of State spokeâ€”if I may have the attention of the right hon. Gentleman for a momentâ€”he did not interpret to us what is meant by the words in Clause 7(6) that he shall publish a statement
	<br><q><p>"in such manner as he thinks fit".</p></q>
No doubt we shall have a longer exposition on this from the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that this Bill will provide ample scope for debate and many opportunities for interesting contributions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. That is why I have dealt only with some of the main points. I say again, as I did at the start of my speech that we welcome the Bill in principle, in the belief that responsibility breeds responsibility, and because we are glad that Scotland is to be first to give this unique status to the teaching profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of time I shall not follow the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir). I believe this to be a bad Bill because the intention behind it is bad. One may read the Bill and miss the intention. What is the intention? It is to solve what the teaching profession in Scotland considers to be the major problem raised by the existence of the uncertificated teachers. The reason the profession wishes to solve that problem is it believes that by so doing teachers may be better able to claim the salaries and conditions to which they believe they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to argue with the teachers about their salaries and conditions. I believe, indeed, that it would have been much easier, and that everyone would have been saved a lot of time and trouble, if, instead of introducing this Bill, the salaries of teachers had been increased and their conditions made satisfactory. We are told that the purpose of the Bill is to establish the prestige and standing of teachers in the community. Status can never be achieved in this way. We may establish all the professional institutions and societies we wish but in so doing we shall never achieve prestige. Teachers themselves will determine whether or not they can establish status in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley Committee Report is a rather remarkable document. The Committee examined the workings of existing professional organisations such as the B.M.A. and the Scottish Legal Society. I hope that the Committee did not consider that either of these organisations have great prestige or perform a great function in the community. I refer particularly to the legal profession in Scotland. These are restrictive bodies whose purpose is to impose restrictive practices against which the whole country is united in the case of ordinary craftsmen and tradesmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
The teachers themselves members of the E.I.S., are remarkable people. Recently they issued a document deploring the attitude of people in industry regarding crafts and trades. They said:
	<br><q><p>"There is a danger, if past attitudes are maintained, that the extra school year will give good training for conditions which ought to prevail but do not yet do so. There has been much consideration of the retraining and transfer of personnel in industry. This, however, is still to meet exceptional circumstances. It must, we believe, become accepted as a normal and continual occurrence, unimpeded by defensive attitudes."</p></q>
The fact is that the attitude of teachers has been defensive all along the line. That is the purpose of this Bill. We find that 21 teachers are to be elected directly by the profession, and we are given to believe that out of 44 there will be only 21 qualified teachers. What nonsense. By far the greater majority of the members of this proposed Council will be teachers with teaching interests. It will be a teachers' council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strangely enough, in this rather strange democracy which has been set up the people who will have to pay the piper are not being given any say at all. Education authorities, as such, will not be represented, as they were not represented on the Wheatley Committee. County councils are represented but they are not education authorities. No small or large burgh in Scotland had a say about the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee. Nor will they have any say in the deliberations of this proposed new Council. That is a strange situation, but, of course, in any case, local authority representatives are included only in order to give the Council a decent standing. The Report of the Wheatley Committee is a classic justification for restrictive practices, and I think that teachers should realise that that is what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No academic qualifications will turn men and women into good teachers. This proposed new Council will not solve any of the major educational problems in Scotland. Its creation will not produce one extra teacher. Indeed, the number of people teaching today will be reduced. That is the purpose of the Council. It will not solve the problems either from the point of view of the pupils or the community. It makes no contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers should look at this matter again, when they might find other things
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
that they could do in order to establish prestige and standing in the community. For far too long now when we have had discussions on education matters the teachers have discussed only salaries and conditions. That has been the only subject on the agenda. We know, unless all the children in Scotland are morons, that the education record hardly bears examination. No suggestions are made about this and no consideration given to it. What is a profession? Why is there this insistence on teaching being a profession? Teaching is a job. One could hardly call it a craft, but it is a job. Why is there so much insistence on professional status? It is not because of snob value; the majority of teachers are far too sensible for that. It is a way to establish the right to a higher rate of pay. It is insisted on for exactly the same reason that trade unions have sought to establish the position of craftsmenâ€”because thereby the members of the unions would be able to claim higher wages and better conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to see what happens about the election of 21 teachers by the votes of 39,000 other teachers. How will that be done? Will the people who are nominated be given time off to conduct an election campaign? Will not they be delegates? Because, when they are campaigning, will not they be seeking votes and putting forward points of view: "If you elect me to this Council, I will doâ€”"this, that, or the other? I do not think that consideration has been given to this matter. It may be that in conducting the election the teachers may learn a thing or two about democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like this Bill and I do not like the thinking behind it. I do not think that it contributes one iota to the solution of the problems of education in Scotland. I hope that we shall be able so to alter and shape it that the Bill may become an effective Measure. I hope that the teachers will take a different attitude and debate different policies, and, by their actions, establish the prestige which they desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the speech of the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) will have been met with acclaim by all his colleagues, more especially, if I may make
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
a rough guess, when one assumes from the teaching qualifications held personally by the hon. Member that some 400 children might be being taught this morning by those who are actually qualified to do so. It is not, therefore, for me to delay the Committee by making further comments on the hon. Member's speech. It will be adequate to allow his colleagues to make representations from their point of view after this Committee has finished its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. I do not regard it as perfect, as, no doubt, the Committee stage will show, but it is a good step in the right direction. I also join with those who have paid tribute to Lord Wheatley and his Committee for presenting the Report on which the Bill is established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the Teaching Council is very great indeed. It is important for the very reason of which the hon. Member for Paisley seems to lack appreciation, namely, that the teachers themselves should be in charge of the standards of their own profession. This is not at all a dishonourable aim and I am glad that the Bill sets out to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, in my view, a considerable importance in status in the Bill. I may have misunderstood the Secretary of State, but I was sorry that he did not attach more importance to the fact that the Bill will bring considerable status to the teaching profession, and rightly so. What I regard as of greatest importance, however, is that the profession having to a large extent taken its own affairs into its own hands, there will remain the Secretary of State's overriding influence upon the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the majority of members of the Council will be teachers. About that there can be no dispute. Therefore, we must acknowledge, as we have all said, that the influence of the teachers will be paramount. If, however, there is to be this majority representation, upon which we are agreed, the general public are entitled to an absolute safeguard that Parliament must have the ultimate responsibility "in relation to the prevailing conditions at any time", which is the best phrase I can find. It could well be, and some of us already think and will, no doubt, express this view in Committee, that there may be prevailing conditions now
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
which would suggest a course or courses not necessarily acceptable to the profession itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the fundamental point is probably the degree to which the Secretary of State maintains control. That is why, as my noble Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) has said, there is a question in a good many people's minds about whether the method adopted in the Bill is agreed to be the best method for ensuring both control and also opportunity for points of view to be expressed at that final point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the few minutes I have allowed myself to address the Committee I must make one last point concerning discipline in relation to the fundamental purpose of the Bill. Those of us who have had experience of difficulties arising from questions of discipline within the profession must be particularly glad that questions of discipline will now rest with the profession itself. This is also an important step forward and a right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the composition of the Council, my noble Friend has already said that she wished to represent the point of view which has been put forward by the Church of Scotland. I do so this morning because I consider that the position of the established Church of Scotland in the councils of education throughout the centuries is such that it is unique and it is such that it is fundamental to the whole question of the Bill. I wish, therefore, to read an extract from the resolution passed by the Church of Scotland Education Committee, presented to the General Assembly and accepted by that body in May, 1964. It is in the following terms:
	<br><q><p>"The General Assembly, much concerned that the Church's representation on the General Teaching Council will be entirely dependent upon the discretion of the Secretary of State, do not consider that this will adequately represent the long historical connection that the Church of Scotland has had with education and the part it has had in the training of teachers and instruct the Committee to seek direct representation on the proposed Council."</p></q>
That has been presented to the full General Assembly of our National Church. Therefore, it is a matter to which, when it comes to be debated in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
detail, we should pay close attention. It is right that we should bring it in at this early stage of the Bill, because we deem it to be so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point outâ€”and here comes the case made earlier by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan)â€”that, in pre-Reformation days, education in Scotland, which was quite extensive, was undoubtedly in the hands of the Church. In post-Reformation days there is no doubt whateverâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which Church?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In pre-Reformation days. The hon. Member should think back a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In post-Reformation daysâ€”if I am right, the date was 1560â€”we find that the Book of Discipline was written and accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first Book of Discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first Book of Discipline was that upon which all education in Scotland right up to the present time has been based. Perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) will accept that this embraces all Churches as we look at it at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a point which the hon. Lady is ignoring, whether deliberately or not I do not know. She ought clearly to designate the Church of which she is thinking in both pre- and post-Reformation days, because there are many Churches involved in the second period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be led into that. My understanding of the Church in pre-Reformation days is quite clear, and I hope that my view is shared by some others who have a closer knowledge than I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In post-Reformation days, the fact that one may then bring in a variety of denominations does not alter the point that I am seeking to put for the established Church of the land. That is why I hope that I am putting it forward with force. I have, however, paid tribute to the fact that at the earliest time the established Church of the land was the Roman Catholic Church, which did the teaching in pre-Reformation days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the post-Reformation world after 1560 is surely that the Church
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
had direct representation in educational matters until 1872, because the schools were parish schools and the parish schools were directly under the parish church. After 1872, the Church was granted direct representation on all educational setups in order that there should be continuity for the direct influence of the Church on education. I think I am also right in saying that in 1826 the first teacher training was established by the Church and that the Church continued to train teachers until 1907. Therefore, it can be fairly established that the contribution by the established Church to education in Scotland has been continuous and direct. That is why we should introduce that aspect at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not for one moment claiming that the Roman Catholic Church has not played a substantial part. I have been criticised before for the view I hold, namely, that it should be a source of pride to us all in Scotland that the Roman Catholic Church has its own schools and that we take these schools within our national education system. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to go into the detail of who should represent Church interests at this stage, because it would obviously be a case of the proportion of representation which the Secretary of State would be agreeable to grant. Therefore, of the six people to be nominated by the Secretary of State it could well be argued that, if a substantial representation is given to the established Church of Scotland, representation should be granted to others as well. This matter is so fundamental to the life of the nation that it is right that it should be put forward for consideration and included in our earliest consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many other hon. Members wish to speak. There is a good deal which I should like to say about the Bill, but I shall restrain myself this morning knowing that there will be further opportunities. I conclude by welcoming the Bill and by stressing once more to the Committee the grave obligation which is placed upon us all to see that we here in 1965 do not break the centuries-old link which the Church and education have had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a rather odd situation today. My intervention has been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
quoted from both sides of the Committee as advocacy of the claims of one Church or another to representation on the new Council. I shall be in a rather difficult position when I go back to my constituency, because I belong neither to the Roman Catholic Church nor to the Church of Scotland. There is another church known as the Free Church of Scotland or, by its proper name, the Church of Scotland Free, which is its official title. It still aspiresâ€”and its claim may yet spread rather more widely in theological circles in Scotlandâ€”to be recognisedâ€”on its own termsâ€”as the Church of Scotland Free in place of the existing Church of Scotland, so-called. Therefore, I am not to be taken as being committeed to the support exclusively of the claims expressed in either of the two documents which have been sent to us, one by the Church of Scotland and the other by the Roman Catholic Church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I did was to ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State as the responsible Minister to make a clear statement, as far as that was possible for him at that moment at short notice, about what he intended to do concerning the representation of these two bodies from among the Churches on the new Council. There are, of course, other Churches which might well think of writing to us afterwards and then expect us to make further Second Reading speeches and take decisions on principle when the time for doing that on this Bill will long have passed. I should not be surprised if, after today's claims for at least two Churches, we have a spate of requests from the Episcopal Church, the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, the United Free Church, Plymouth Brethren and all the others as well. However, the theological side of the debate can be allowed to argue itself out later in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, it is interesting to note that the two Churches which have written to us through their spokesmen have recommended joint representation. The Church of Scotland recommends and supports the claim of the Roman Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland recommends and supports the claim of the Church of Scotland. That broadmindedness in itself is to be welcomed. It is to be hoped that it will prevail in the counsels of the Training Council. If so, then a difficult point will have been met about

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
the dangers which would arise from a too narrow interpretation of the function of membership. At that stage, we would hope that those who happen to be Church of Scotland members and those who happen to be Roman Catholic members would satisfy the wishes of most of us, on both sides of the Committee, that they will regard themselves, not as delegates or representatives, but as fully representative members of the Council, representative of the public interests, of the best interests of the teaching profession and of the best interests, above all, of the children, which is the most important aspect of all.

12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always sorry that in these debates we can never get a little more evidence or, even, a little clearer indication of where the much discussed recruiting in wider fields will be most successful. Everyone talks about drawing from a wider section of the community for new entrants to the teaching profession. We all pay lip service to this because everyone recognises that industrial experience in industry and in other professions and occupations, outside teaching, in the trade unions and elsewhere, can of itself bring a new and valuable experience and quality into teaching. I am sure that the teachers themselves have long recognised this, probably more than most people have. All they ask is that those who aspire to enter should come into the profession fully trained to teach and equally qualified with those who entered it from the beginning as teachers. This is something which they have the right to ask and, indeed, it is something which they must defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little surprised by some of the criticisms of the teaching profession made by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson). Surely, there can be no body more jealous of the standards of its profession than the very union to which he and my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence), for example, belong, the Amalgamated Engineering Union. There is no more craft-conscious union, none more jealous of the standards of engineering skills, than the A.E.U.â€”one of the longest established, most respected, and most militant of all unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with what my hon. Friend says, but the A.E.U. along with other craft unions has been under constant pressure and criticism from everyone in the country. Everyone else imagines that he knows a great deal more about engineering and engineering standards than the members of the unions themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that can be so, least of all from hon. Members on this side of the Committee. As we in the Labour Party can now claim, and will increasingly be able to claim, the support of the majority of the electorate in this country, it can hardly be true that my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the A.E.U. come under criticism from "everyone in the country," as he says. It may be that they are criticised by their political and other opponents and enemies; but who on earth is not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has received an almost universal welcome from the teaching profession. There have been matters of dispute in the profession, and it has had problems with its breakaway unions, too. The teaching profession has its problems, just as the Secretary of State has his; but, broadly speaking, the provisions of this Bill do not create an issue on which there are any breakaways or fundamental differences. I welcome the Bill very much and I congratulate my right hon. Friend on having introduced it so promptly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot go quite so far as he does in criticism of his predecessor. I feel that we should congratulate the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) on having appointed the Wheatley Committee, an action which it would be ungracious not to acknowledge as having been forward-looking and progressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all join, too, in complimenting Lord Wheatley and his colleagues on an excellent report, characteristically excellent, of course, as regards any task with which John Wheatley himself is concerned. I hope that he will pardon me for calling him by his more familiar name; but he was long a familiar figure in this Committee not only in debates on education but in all our debates in past times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many debating points will arise on the Bill which we can come to in Committee; but at this stage I should likeâ€”as I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
saidâ€”some further and better indicationâ€”evidence would be too strong a wordâ€”that we shall be able to recruit widely and in great numbers from outside the traditional sources of recruiting for the teaching profession. The teachers who have been in shortest supply, if one may use that expression, have been the maths and science, the specialist teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to fall into the habit of making again the speeches which I used to make on this subject twenty years ago and before the war, but there are certain basic factors which we must face as practical people when we come to compete with industry for the services of these specialists. It is an almost impossible competition for education authorities, and we may as well face that fact. So long as the teaching profession and the local education authorities have to compete with industry for our scarce supply of mathematics and science specialists, there will be a battle which certainly cannot be won overnight or, I believe, ever won at all for education. My own view is that the education authorities can never do as much to attract these recruits as, for example, I.C.I. I.C.I, will not survive without its specialists, and education will not survive without them either. So what is the answer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to look at the advertisements, sometimes full-page advertisements, in the weekend and daily newspapers by which I.C.I., English Electric and all the other great firms advertise for the specialists they need. Massive attractions are offered even for boys leaving school, and to girls now. There is an enormous demand for them as well as for new graduates. On the other hand, one looks at educational journals or the local papers and find the tiny little advertisements in small print inserted by education authorities who want teachers for this and that subject, including science and mathematics. The advertisements alone express the difference between the financial and other drawing power of industry, on the one hand, and of the local authorities on the other. I am sorry to be pessimistic, but I said often and many years agoâ€”and the answer to contradict me has never been provided sinceâ€”that I did not believe that we should win this battle for education. I.C.I, and all the great firms are prepared to pay heavily for this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
form of skill and capacity. They mustâ€”to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the second difficulty that, in this competition between industry and education, we are working within a very limited human range. It is fairly well established that nature itself imposes its limitation upon the number of people in any hundred, thousand or million of any community, capable of understanding mathematics and, therefore, the derivatives of mathematics, namely, physics, chemistry and so on. We shall always face this natural limitation, in the first place, quite apart from the financial and other competition with industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may talk glibly about drawing people from other sources, particularly from the industry for other than money rewards; but what will be the other inducements? One can say that a few people who have gone into industry, perhaps by mistake, perhaps because of its greater material attractions than those of teaching, or because of something wrong with their own education in the first place, may belatedly sense in themselves an avocation to teach. Although it may be true that we could draw a few in that way, out of such a sense of avocation, it is most unlikely that we shall ever draw many. I do not believe that many able people who have gone into industry and proved themselves thereâ€”industry has its own standards, increasingly high standards nowâ€”will find suddenly that they have, after all, an avocation to teach and decide that they took the wrong turning years before. I doubt it very much, and I am sure that we shall get fewer and fewer recruits from industry. For industry is offering more and more inducements to those who are prepared to enter it and to stay, quite apart from the financial rewards. In any event, the ablest people will not be attracted from good industrial jobs into teaching just for the lower salary. Teaching salaries will never attract people of any standing away from industry. What, then, are the other inducements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that it is the stated view of Professor Flowers, a member of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy which was, that a man in industry who spends one day a week teaching would actually be more useful to industry, and not less, and that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
in these circumstances, some firms at least would probably, free of any expense, allow such men to go into teaching? If this is right, will the Under-Secretary of State, when she winds up, tell us whether it is a question being actively discussed by the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers? My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State told us that it is considering the problem generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend. In fact, I was coming to that point. We might, instead of competing all the time, be able to extend our resources by pooling them in some such way. This is not a new suggestion in this Committee. But the main point I was at is that salaries alone are not sufficient to draw people from the new industrial and other sources about which we have talked here for twenty or thirty years. What are the other inducements? Are there any?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, at least, goes part of the way to enhance the status of people in the teaching profession. It gives them some practical participation in the management of and entry to their profession and the safeguarding of its standards. This is something which has been sadly lacking hitherto, and for this reason, if for no other, I welcome it. But, still, industry offers mathematics and science specialistsâ€”apart from more moneyâ€”far more attractive facilities for post-graduate researchâ€”indeed, for a lifetime at researchâ€”than the education authorities can offer. This will always be so, unless we are prepared to spend in every locality in education massive sums of money; and even in these enlightened days in education at the school level, we are not contemplating expenditure of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, as regards both salaries and other possible inducements, industry always wins the battle for these specialists. I am sure that this constant bidding by education authorities against industry will just go on and on, with the education authorities losing every time. They must, therefore, accept that there is a limited source to which we should apply ourselves more urgently to help the school shortages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) hit upon one point to which I was coming, the idea of, so to speak, day-release in reverse, to allow
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
certain people in industry capable ofâ€”and also equipped forâ€”teaching in our schools. Here again, the teaching profession would have the right to require, and the parents and children would have the right to expect, the standards of education to be safeguarded. Those who came to the Schools from industry for a day, or even two days, a week would have to be not only qualified and capable, but also suitably trained to teach children. This is at the basis of any safeguarding of entry and teaching standards. It is not enough to pull an engineer out of his job and ask him to go and teach once a week. He must be a teacher as well, even if his contribution is of value to industry and even where schools are suitably equipped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, one recognises that, in every secondary school at all events, there is a tremendous waste of capacity and ability which will never be called upon in teaching pupils, even up to the pre-university stage. But the minute one mentions this one is in danger of being on the fringe of talking about dilution. This is a problem which the teachers will now have an increasing opportunity to deal with themselves because they will be more in charge of the standards for training and, to some extent recruiting, in their own profession. We cannot afford waste of capacity in the profession; but we cannot at the same time afford the dilution which, as good trade unionists, if I may say so, the teachers have rightly resisted. Nevertheless, we shall not solve the problem just by talking about taking a handful of people from industry, temporarily, part-time, or permanently, and bringing them into teaching. We shall not solve it by any one day a week arrangement without the other conditions of teaching standards being full satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend touched on the question of building and accommodation and the physical environment of teacher and pupil. I wish that we knew a little more about the school building prospects. The other day, in a speech somewhere in the country, the Under-Secretary of State was good enough to say that we expect by 1970â€”apart from the new, additional effect on numbers required of the raising of the school-leaving ageâ€”to see something like satisfaction of our present needs in the recruitment of teachers, and she said that she expected that the accommodation would also then be there to meet the new requirements. I very much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
hope that she is right, and I hope also that she will be able to give me a satisfactory reply the next time I put a Question down on the Order Paper about it. The replies which I have had in the past from the Secretary of State have been that he saw no prospect of restoring the cuts in the allocations for school building to the Scottish local authorities. It is not good enough for that sort of answer to be given on the Floor of the House, when we and the local authorities are so anxious about it, and then for a Minister to say in the country that, by 1970, everything should be all right, and that we shall have both the teachers and the school buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we shall have the new school buildings by 1970. The present situation in my own constituency is wholly depressing. Conditions there are such that we are about two so-called phases behind, and we are building now at the rate of one major new school project a year for the next four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should be obliged if the hon. Member could come back more directly to the subject of the Teaching Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect your Ruling, as I respect you personally, Mr. Brewis, but the Secretary of State went to the greatest possible lengths on the whole subject of recruiting and teaching conditions, and if the schoolroom is not part of the working and physical conditions of the teacher, what is? I hope, therefore, that you will allow me one more minute in which to discuss this subject. I respect your point that the Bill as such is the main matter under discussion, but, if I may say so, the Secretary of State himself, in opening the debate, touched on the Bill last and dealt at great length, not tangentially by any means, with all aspects of recruiting and administration first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out of respect to you, Mr. Brewis, I conclude the point in this way. I hope that we shall in the very near future have, above all, a clear reassurance that school building in Scotland will be speeded up to match our ambitions in recruiting, our ambitions in raising the school-leaving age, and our ambitions in meeting all the requirements of education in 1970. I do not know whether this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
is possible. I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State passionately wants it, as we all do. Unless the local authorities can be authorised to go on now with their full programmes, the buildings will certainly not be there by 1970. This worries everyone in Scotland, because we are desperately behind in this provision and are using Victorian schools, and have slum school conditions in many constituencies. Therefore I should like to have a statement made on this matter this morning by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill itself and find little reason for criticising it. It can be criticised in detail; but at this stage I only say that it is a welcome Bill which we are glad to see introduced so promptly. It was part of the high priorities of our party in the Election programme and before then, but so also was much more school building. I ask my hon. Friend to match the new initiative in recruiting and training of teachers with greater efforts in regard to school building so that we can say to our constituents that this has high priority and will be carried out with the same promptitude as that with which this Bill has been introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly in support of the Bill, first as a member of a local authority for many years and still a member, because I know it is the view of local authorities that there is a great deal of good in the Bill. I have had informal talks with members of the E.I.S. in my constituency and find that they also welcome the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make only two brief points, one of which has been raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee this morning. That is in reference to the letters put forward by the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church. I declare my interest as a member of the Church of Scotland. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) I think they put forward a very strong case for representation on the Council. I support their representation to the full. In my constituency we are fortunate in having a number of first-class Roman Catholic schools. It would be a pity if the Roman Catholic Church did not have representation on this Council. The Secretary of State has the difficulty of keeping the size of the Council within bounds, but we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
want these two Churches to work wherever possible in co-operation, and they have put forward a strong case. Anything which we in Parliament can do to encourage the teaching of religion in the schools must be commended. We should support these two Churches through the passage of this Bill till it becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I raise is that I feel the uncertificated teacher has no champion. The hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) has spoken on this matter this morning. We must appreciate that we shall need to have uncertificated teachers for a good many years to come. Full certification is the aim we all have, but that is not practicable at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should not those who are uncertificated at present be given a certain periodâ€”say, three yearsâ€”in which to obtain the qualifications which are necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bet the hon. Member does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years we have heard continual criticism of our teacher-training programme. Last night I listened to the debate in the House for over an hour and heard not one new idea from hon. Members opposite. There was a call for investigations and inquiries, but no new idea was produced for the obtaining of more teachers. That was a disappointment after what we have heard over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has suggested a period of three years for training. That is a good suggestion. I hope that as many uncertificated teachers as possible will take up that idea. Their status should not be lowered without careful thought being given to the matter. Many uncertificated teachers have some training and they do a particularly good job. They are commended by head teachers, by parents, and often, unofficially, by pupils. It should be remembered that no head teacher need employ an uncertificated teacher a day longer than is required. I express the hope that when this Council is formedâ€”I hope it will be formedâ€”the position of the uncertificated will not be cast aside and their position in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
hierarchy of the profession not unduly lowered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to speak for any great length of time in this debate unless I am provoked. I might not have intervened but for the speech of the hon. Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) which has drawn me to my feet. I am sorry that she has not waited to bear the load of her own sins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficultâ€”it is impossibleâ€”to divorce religion from education. It is generally but wrongly thought that the three Rs are reading, writing and arithmetic. The three Rs are reading, writing and religion. Religion at one time was one of the most prominent features of education. At that time the Church had an enormous grip on our educational methods and the content of education. Many teachers, because of that association, always had a feeling that this domination was not in the best interests of education. I think a more sensible attitude on the part of the Church has somewhat ironed out the rough edges of that struggle, but we still have misunderstandings when we talk about the representation of the Church in educational matters. This has been emphasised today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my own case as an example. I was a member of the United Presbyterian Church, the U.P. as it was called in the past when there were the U.P. and the U.F. I was born into the U.P. Kirk. At that time there was also the Free Church of Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has said that that Church still has a vigorous life without educational representation in the part of Scotland which he so well represents. But there is another Free Church in Scotland, a Church which was adorned by an hon. Member of this House all the years of his life, one who figured prominently in the political life of Scotland. I refer to the Rev. James Burr. He continued as a member and was Moderator of the United Free Church (Continuing) of Scotland. It had no representation on any educational body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have a memorandum from the Church of Scotland, which is a fairly recent religious occurrence in the life of Scotland because it represents the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
union of the United Presbyterian Church to which I belonged and the United Free Church. That is a fairly recent happening in terms of religious organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Kirk consortium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, a Kirk consortium. It now claims that because of a long historical connection with education it ought automatically to continue with religious representation on the new Council. That is something which in honesty we cannot accept. I do not accept historical reasons alone for religious representation on educational bodies. I accept reasons dictated by wisdom and advisability. Those are the only reasons which, in my view, merit representation on any educational body. I have long been associated with education. Teachers have always been a subordinate body to the Church. Teachers fundamentally have resented that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the Secretary of Stateâ€”I am glad to say, a Labour Secretary of Stateâ€”has said that he is to create in the teaching profession a new growth point. That is one of the biggest steps which has taken place in recent years in lifting teaching from what I might call the position of being underdog, which my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) seemed to emphasise a little too harshly. There may have been reason in some slight respect for the attitude he took up, but that attitude has been largely forced on the teaching profession. Many men I know have fought nobly to lift this profession on to a plane more nearly equal to that occupied by medicine, by religionâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Engine drivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:â€”and other professions. If my hon. Friend suggests the engine drivers' profession, I agree with him that it is a very important occupation which does the work of guidance, like the teacher. I said that I should not speak for long unless I was provoked. I am sorry to notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley is now running away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that when he entered in battle array the last thing he would do would be to desert the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
battle. However, I shall not start a battle at half-past twelve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my right hon. Friend is seeking to create a growth point in the teaching profession which will cause it to rise in the public's estimation and which will enable the teachers to extend their influence and power within their own profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were many other points which I should have liked to have put to my right hon. Friend. One might have brought me into conflict with the Chair. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles was ruled out of order when he referred to the question of school buildings. I intervened in my right hon. Friend's speech to refer to that point. My right hon. Friend referred to it, but the Chairman did not rule it out of order at that stage. I am sure that you, Mr. Brewis, will not destroy the basic equality which should exist at all levels in this Committee. In the Scottish Grand Committee we are all Jock Thompson's bairns and liable to the same rules. However, in view of the time, I will not continue with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sought to intervene in my right hon. Friend's speech in order to refer to Clause 7, but he wisely cautioned me not to say anything about it. My right hon. Friend is, as I say, creating a growth point, and I will not criticise him in any way. Yet he is to keep the reins quite firmly within his own hands. The Clause says that
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing the requirements as to education, training and fitness to teach to be fulfilled by a person in order to qualify him to be recommended by the governing body of a college of education to the Council for registration."</p></q>
If I interpret that correctly, my right hon. Friend is to keep the question of qualifications in his own hands. I think that that is welcome, and that as long as we have a Secretary of State like my right hon. Friend he will not allow those qualifications to sink, as they have been doing over the post-war years. It is basic to the success of the Teaching Council that the qualifications of the men and women who, we hope, will come into the profession should be of the highest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also gratified that, despite what Clause 7 says, and despite the fact that there is a little diffidence in the teaching
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
profession about accepting the Bill without amendment, the letter which I have from the Educational Institute of Scotland says that that body welcomes the Bill. I think that that must be the governing attitude of this Committee to the Bill. Those most affected by the Bill, and who, I hope, will profit most from it, welcome it, and because of that I wish it God speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unusual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding what the hon. Member says, I shall be very brief. I have two points to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, like everyone who has spoken, I welcome the Bill. However, I welcome it in a very qualified way because I regard it as a step, but only a step, to putting the teaching profession in Scotland on a proper level. For far too long the teaching profession in Scotland has had no status. It started way back in the days of John Knox as a sort of poor relation of the Church. A teacher was a stickit minister or a man who had not qualified for the Church. Gradually the teaching profession has become the whipping boy of all sorts of peopleâ€”starting from the kirk session, going through school boards, the county council and, latterly, to a large extent, the Secretary of State himself.

I am disappointed that all the Secretaries of State seem to have the same idea, namely, to hang on to whatever power they have for as long as they can. As a member of a learned profession in Scotland, I should like to see the teaching profession given the same status as my profession and the medical profession and, indeed, practically every profession or semi-profession, such as to the chiropodists. These professions are completely self-governing. It seems to me obvious that the teaching profession, which has never been given the status which it deserves, should, like the others, be completely and utterly self-governing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would apply that thinking to the whole range of activities and all jobs? Does he agree that the position resulting from the status and government of the legal profession in Scotland is satis-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
factoryâ€”for instance, the situation of the advocates in Scotland? Does all the legal profession agree with what has happened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised the Committee to be brief, but I must deal with points if they are put to me. In answer to the hon. Member's point, I come logically to the solicitors' branch of the legal profession in Scotland. The legislation on that subject is comparatively recent. It is as recent as 1933. Under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act, 1933, a council was set up very similar to the Teaching Council. However, the Solicitors' Council is appointed solely by the members of the profession. It has worked extremely well in Scotland. The first duty of the Solicitors' Council in Scotland was to do precisely what the Council which we are discussing has to do, namely, to set down qualifications for entry to the profession. The Solicitors' branch of the legal profession in Scotland has done that very successfully since 1933 without any interference from the Secretary of State, the Faculty of Advocates or anybody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one qualification in case the solicitors' profession runs away with itselfâ€”and, after all, the teaching profession, like the solicitors' branch of the legal profession, might do that. I refer to the power of veto. In the Solicitors Act, 1933, that power is properly vested in the Lord President of the Court of Session. Therefore, if the solicitors' profession makes rules for admission to the profession which are not reasonable, the Lord President has the right of veto and can refer the matter back to the Council for reconsideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that something very similar would be ideal for the teaching profession so that the regulations are made not by the Secretary of State as a result of advice from the Teaching Council but by the Teaching Council itself subject to the exercise of veto by the Secretary of State should he think that proper in the circumstances. I appeal to the Secretary of State to give consideration to this matter, and, if he cannot do what I suggest in the Bill, bear in mind that the Bill is only a first step and that the teaching profession should be self-governing as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point which has great substance is this. Under the Solicitors Act.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
1933, two penalties are laid down for a breach of professional discipline. The first is the ultimate penaltyâ€”which is laid down in the Billâ€”of expulsion from the professionâ€”striking off the register. That is an extremely harsh penalty, and there might be instances in which a lesser penalty would meet the case. The Solicitors' Council has the power to impose fines, or to admonish, or impose lesser penalties, but the ultimate penalty is reserved to the Court of Session. I suggest to the Secretary of State that in this respect the Bill is a little harsh, and I ask him to consider whether later he might introduce less harsh penalties which might be imposed by the Teaching Council with the right of appeal to the Court of Session. However, the ultimate penalty of striking off the register should be restricted to the Court of Session acting on the advice and recommendation of the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that these are points of importance and I ask the Secretary of State to give consideration to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One aspect of the Bill rather surprises me. Throughout the debate it has been said that teachers are not paid enough and that they do not have enough status. Yet we learn that the finances of the Teaching Council are to be derived from funds payable by the teachers. We are, therefore, setting up a body which will cost money and the first thing that we do is to make the people who, we say, are underpaid liable for the expenses of running the Council. It seems to me that that is a contradiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other points which perturb me a great deal more. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) indicated that all professions should be self-governing. Surely a great deal of the trouble is that they are self-governing. The most restrictive of restrictive practices are those put into force by professions. There are no more ruthless bodies than those which control, for example, the medical and legal professions. Nobody enforces more restrictive practices. Nobody is more tyrannical in some of its decisions or in enforcing discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thing which perturbs me more than anything else about the Bill is the fact that the Teaching Council is over-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
loaded with teachers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) asked, how are these teachers to be elected? It is all very well to say that they do not represent anyone or any body and that they are not delegates. But we know that the teachers are a very powerful body. As a representative of a local authority, I have attended a number of meetings at which teachers have been represented. There is no doubt that, although they may be appointed as individuals, they never put forward individual points of view; they put forward the points of view of their associations. No doubt this situation will continue. We might just as well have a one-Clause Bill saying, "We are handing this matter over to the associations; they can do what they like with it." That is what it boils down to. Even though the Teaching Council is overloaded with teachers to such a colossal extent they still insist on safeguards in regard to the Disciplinary Committee and the other committee and that there must be a majority of teachers on them. This is even written into the Bill. This is quite wrong. I do not think that there is any doubt, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley said, that the Bill will result in further restrictive practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deplore the fact that repesentatives of the Churches have no right to be on this body. They are represented on every other education organisation, and, in my experience, they have always been very good members. To have a variety of interests represented on a body is the best way to get fair and good decisions. There are to be only four representatives from local authorities in Scotland on the Council and none from the Churches. After all, even the directors of education will be teachers. This seems to me be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the question of a conflict of interests which may arise. There may be a situation in the future, as has happened in the pastâ€”and which, indeed, exists nowâ€”when there will not be a sufficient number of certified teachers to educate the children, so that we may have to compromise and accept uncertificated teachers. If the controlling body is composed overwhelmingly of teachers, and if, as has been expressed by the teachers over the years, despite a shortage, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
should get rid of uncertificated teachers, what will be the situation? It will become very difficult to retain uncertificated teachers for any length of time, whether the supply of certificated teachers is sufficient or not. To me, it seems wrong that if such a conflict of interests should arise the controlling body should be overloaded with the representatives of one section of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be doing some amending of legislation by reference if we accept the provisions in this Bill, and that is a process, as I have said before, to which I object strongly. By the provisions of Clause 16, for instance, we shall amend the 1962 Act, despite the fact that we have a 1963 Act. I see no reason for complicating the position by accepting this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not the Secretary of State have power to register teachers or to grant permission for people to teach? Suppose a conflict of interest arises and someone has to decide between the acceptance of uncertificated teachers or no education for children. Shall we send the children to school for half a day instead of a full dayâ€”as happened in Glasgowâ€”because of the shortage of teachers? Should not the existing power be retained so that the Secretary of Stateâ€”the only person who will have power if we accept these provisionsâ€”may give permission for people to teach? Why should not that power be retained, so that in the event of an emergency the Secretary of State may authorise people whom he thinks fit to teach in our schools? I see no reason for removing that power from the Secretary of State as would appear to be done by the provisions of that Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley I am beginning to wonder whether this is a good, or even a necessary Bill. I am inclined to doubt whether it will help in any way. I should certainly oppose the setting up of such a body as is contemplated which would have an overwhelming representation of one section with a strong financial interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to try to clear up some of the misconceptions in certain attitudes expressed on this Bill and to the teachers' organisations and indeed regarding the attitude which has been adopted towards the attitude of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
teachers to this Bill. I am in the peculiar position of having to deal as much with points made by hon. Members on this side of the Committee as those made by hon. Members opposite. Not only did I find the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) surprising, but certain points which he made I considered to be quite shocking. I hasten to say that hon. Members on this side of the Committee do not generally accept the views expressed by my hon. Friend and I was sorry to hear him express them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that my hon. Friend speaks for himself. Or has he permission to speak for all the rest of the hon. Members on this side of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking with a certain confidence because of my knowledge of the views held by my hon. Friends and, indeed, the whole Labour movement in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley says that there is a certain intention relating to this Bill which has nothing to do with the securing of a Teaching Council or the setting up of a structure which would, for the first time, permit the full involvement by teachers along with other educationists in the creating of conditions which, from their experience, they know are necessary to provide the right kind of training. I am sure that teachers will be pleased to hear from my hon. Friend that the purpose of the Bill is to improve salaries and conditions. I should have thought that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State could have found an easier method of dealing with that than the production of a fairly complicated Measure of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways teachers have less control over the method of entry into their profession than is the case in almost any other organisation. Indeed they have less control than any trade on the Clyde. The union to which my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley belongs would not tolerate the kind of conditions of entry which have to be tolerated by the teachers. This being the case, we must look at what rights teachers have in helping to control their own situation. So long as we have the present Secretary of State and his colleagues in office
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
I shall not feel perturbed on this point, but I can see that there might well arise cause for worry in the future. I do not feel worried that there is such an overwhelming majority of teachers on the proposed Council as we have been told. My worry is whether there are sufficient teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that out of 44 members 21 will be teachers elected by the profession. Let us break down this figure. Sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"The elected members shall comprise:â€”
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(	<i>a</i>) 5 registered teachers employed in colleges of education, including 4 (but not more than 4) principals".</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></q>
This is rather like saying that in a trade union there shall be five members from the diecasting section, but four of them must be foremen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sub-paragraph also states:
	<br><q><p>"	<i>(b)</i> 2 registered teachers employed in further education centres"â€”</p></q>
but one must be a principal. That is like saying that there shall be two trade union representatives from the foundry but one must be the works manager. One knows that, in terms of teachers' viewpoints the majority on this Council may well be not so great as it would appear, because in the progress from the "shop floor" to "management" attitudes tend to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Schedule also states that there shall be
	<br><q><p>"9 registered teachers employed in secondary schools, including 5 (but not more than 5) head teachers".</p></q>
I have the greatest regard for many head teachers, but this kind of grading may tend to increase the age of members of the Council and if is not correct to say that age always brings wisdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may think that I, as a new Member, would, of course, say that. Age may also result in people becoming further removed from recent educational thinking. If, as is suggested by my hon. Friend, teaching is a job and not a craft, whatever that means, one of our tasks must be to bring back thinking about education into education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that of all the professions teachers are probably the most Philistine about their own profession. Teachers of English may be willing to talk about literary theory. Teachers of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
mathematics may be willing to discuss parabolas, but it is difficult to get teachers to talk about education. The enhancing of their status and the extending of the nature of the Council by including younger people may result in less of the kind of controlling responsibility which often removes fresh thinking. We are taking a step towards bringing back educational thinking. It seems to me that there are not too many teachers but, if anything, too few, and that those who will be there will be, to some extent, removed from many of the problems which directly affect teachers. I can understand the reasons, but I feel that there is a gross misconception regarding the problem presented by uncertificated teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that Scottish teachers are interested only in questions relating to their salaries or conditions. I have led many deputations of members of the profession to meet the former Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, whose passing I deplore, Mr. Brooman-White. The deputations were in relation to questions of conditions in schools, not the conditions of teachersâ€”the conditions of school buildings and many similar things. Naturally, when teachers have discussions with local authorities on matters which affect them jointly, it tends to be the case that the working conditions of teachers and questions of salary will arise because of the relationship between teachers and local authorities. The local authorities are the employers of the teachers and in a discussion with one's employers the tendency is to deal with the relationship between employer and employee rather than the relationship between teacher and pupil or teacher and training college. At the same time an examination of the subjects which are discussed at, for example, the conferences of teachers will reveal that a great deal of time is devoted to debates on points about education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the criticisms which are made about the uncertificated teacher we are being told that they are made in an attempt to create conditions in which to secure better salaries. We are told that if we get rid of the uncertificated teachers we shall lose teachers, but that is not so. The existence of poorly qualified persons in the teaching profession acts as a positive disincentive when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
it comes to recruiting the better kind of teacher so that the presence of uncertificated teachers, instead of adding to the teaching strength, tends to reduce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that uncertificated teachers may be highly qualified. The answer to that was provided by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell)â€”if they are highly qualified, they should have no difficulty in obtaining certification. The hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) may remember that after the strike of teachers in Glasgow the then Secretary of State circulated uncertificated teachers to find out how many wished to undertake courses leading to certification. It was discovered that the number of uncertificated teachers who wished to acquire certificates was very small. Lanarkshire has started to operate a procedure to cut down the number of uncertificated teachers and deserves credit for doing so. Within three years there should be no more uncertificated teachers except those who have given an under-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
taking to embark on a course leading to certification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of putting someone out of a job, or of professional jealousy, but of saying that in the teaching profession we want more highly qualified people, and if uncertificated teachers are willing to undertake such a course, the certificated teachers will be willing to work alongside them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, universities must learn to adapt the entrance qualifications for adults. When we talk about special recruitment schemes, we are at present asking adults to undertake adolescent education such as is perfectly suitable for the age group of 12 to 17 or 18, but is not suitable for men or women of 25. For them we must substitute a form of adult education. I am not sure who is the timekeeper, here, Mr. Brewis, you or meâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
