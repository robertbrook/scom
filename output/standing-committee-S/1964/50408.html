	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would, at the outset, like to give notice that at next Tuesday's Sitting I propose to move a Sittings Motion to enable meetings to be held in future on Tuesday afternoons as well as on Tuesday mornings and Thursday mornings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 3.—(DUTIES OF THE BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [6th April],</i> In page 2, line 18, after "the", to insert "industrial".—	<i>[Mr. Malcolm MacMillan.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the adjournment of the Committee on Tuesday, while speaking in support of the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), I was talking about the industrial example set by A.I. Welders of Inverness. While the reputation of that firm is of the highest in industrial circles it is frequently not properly understood by laymen such as ourselves exactly what the company is doing in Inverness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A.I. Welders produce welding machines. The first one they built in Inverness was in 1922 and weighed 20 cwt., which is quite a contrast with the great machines they now build, weighing up to 60 tons. It is not generally known, for example, that the Operation Pluto pipelines were constructed exclusively from machinery built and designed in Inverness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, by an historical accident, A.I. Welders had been sited in, say, Glasgow, a great many people, including many hon. Members of this Committee, would say "impossible" if it were now suggested that the company could do its job just as effectively in Inverness.
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
The reason why I have dwelt on this example of A.I. Welders is that I believe that it effectively demonstrates what is frequently denied that productive industry can operate successfully and competitively in the Highland area. It is at this that, I think, the hon. Member for the Western Isles is getting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that the firm of A.I. Welders is highly progressive and enterprising? Is that not the main reason why it has been so successful? I would certainly not be one of those who would disagree with him on this issue, but it must be pointed out that only a firm which is really progressive and enterprising, as this one is, can succeed in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman jumps ahead of me a little. That was the precise point to which I was coming. It is true that this particular firm has grown because of its daring and determined management, whose loyalty to the area has frequently overridden their commercial assessment of their personal short-term financial advantage. In other words, they have succeeded despite the conditions rather than because of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we must now do—what the Bill must do—is clearly to write into the objectives of the Board the task of providing for the new science-based industries the incentive to come to the Highlands and do the sort of job which A.I. Welders have triumphantly proved can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will quote a short extract from an editorial in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 13th August, 1964. This has point to the subject under discussion. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far the Government policy has been to inject aid into the traditional Highland occupations—farming, fishing and forestry—plus attempts to improve the infrastructure. Clearly, it has failed to revive the economy. A change of policy should be made. State funds should be directed to encouraging new industry as well as the old employments. Incentives, of course, are available for new enterprises, as the location of the Lochaber pulp mill shows. But the Local Employment Act is not enough for a remote area. A sort of industrial colonisation, the deliberate creation of growth points, is required. Dounreay is a case in point. An opportunity was lost by the rejection of Inverness's claims for a university."</p></blockquote>
To the Liberal Party this was a most important facet of the attitude which led
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
us over many years to advocate the creation of a Highland development authority. Really to achieve change industry must come in alongside the expansion and development of agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. As the hon. Member for the Western Isles said, this is where the setting up of a university would have been such a magnificent focus of technical experiment and innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a few years the real asset, hydro-electricity, will become available and we should be able to offer cheaper rates. I was, therefore, pleased with the Answer I received yesterday from the Secretary of State regarding the Hydro-Electric Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the first Amendment to the Bill I said that I was concerned that any future Secretary of State might say that the only proper way in which the Highlands would be able to play a more effective part in the economic and social development of the nation would be through becoming some sort of nature reserve for the relaxation of the workers in the existing connurbations. I sought to insert an emphasis on people in the Highlands, and the Minister was sympathetic. I hope that he will also be sympathetic to this Amendment, which, I believe, has the same kind of emphasis and objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, there is plenty of room for the tourist and the naturalist—and the dotterel bird as well, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) will be pleased to hear—as well as industrialists and industry. There is plenty of room for all. Particularly there is room for well-planned industrial growth; but it must be well planned, because frequently in the Highlands planning has been seen as a negative rather than as a constructive exercise. We are concerned in the Bill—and I hope that all hon. Members fundamentally appreciate and realise this—to redress history, to use the words of the Secretary of State on Second Reading. This inevitably means industrial development, and we should say this in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I will quote a brief portion of the Liberal Party's pamphlet entitled "Highland Development". It lays particular emphasis on industrial redistribution which, I believe, the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
Member for the Western Isles is seeking to emphasise in the Amendment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present distribution of our population and industry is a legacy of the Industrial Revolution; though this revolution brought us tremendous advantages, in its uncontrolled growth it also spawned much that was ugly and inefficient. Now, with the lessons of these failures in our mind, and the technical ability in our hands, we have an opportunity to refashion Scotland in almost any image we choose. We wish to see a Scotland possessed of a healthy and vigorous regional life, competitive, varied and attractive. This will never be possible if we continue to allow and, by implication to encourage, the convergence of our population into already overcrowded areas whose advantages in terms of national resources, have disappeared. London is like a man grown gross with good living, weighed down with useless fatty tissue. But it is not only uncomfortable and unhealthy it is also enormously expensive. And the nation foots the bill. We believe that this is happening in Scotland. We are convinced that in the long term the attraction of urban standards of life must be weighed against those of the new pattern of rural life we envisage—the good life must offer more than good living. In the development of the Highlands we see both the answer and the challenge of a great opportunity."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like hon. Members on both sides of the Committee I am in general agreement with the Amendment—with a few reservations; but it is largely a question of interpretation and emphasis. As the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), who moved the Amendment, indicated, it is important that it should be the right kind of industry which we try to bring to the Highlands. It is important to avoid wild schemes, whether they stem from private or State enterprise. We do not want the sort of schemes which led to poor Mr. Khrushchev's downfall, for example. I would not like to think of the Minister of State or, indeed, his right hon. Friend having to be got rid of as hurriedly as he was. We should also recall, to even the balance between the parties, what Lloyd George used to say about ploughing up the Cairngorms. That, too, was not a very practicable scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason at all why quite a number of different industries should not flourish in the Highlands and, for that matter, in the Islands, too, and I would include in that, once again, the islands in my constituency in the County of Bute. The main difficulty, as always,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
is one of communications, whether in the remoter parts of the mainland or the islands. In practice, therefore, these industries are largely limited to those handling raw materials and end-products which are either locally available in the first place or which are easily transportable or which have a high value in relation to their transportability. Otherwise, as we already see in so many instances today, freight charges simply swamp any profitability which there might be. Another possibility is that the end-product should be something which will fulfil local requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the main thing we want to aim at in trying to bring industry to the Highlands is that what is produced should have a high value in proportion to its weight and transportability. For example, one commodity which fulfills all these requirements, which is of locally available raw materials, which is easily transportable, which is valuable in proportion to its weight, and which is certainly a requirement both locally and elsewhere, is whisky. The only trouble about whisky is that its production does not give very much employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another and different example is an industry which has already been mentioned during the debate on this Clause, namely, aluminium production. The British Aluminium Company at Fort William and Kinlochleven is a good example of how private enterprise can flourish in the Highlands. I think I am right in saying—I will be corrected if I am wrong—that even the hydroelectric scheme originated as the result of private enterprise. Then of course there is the pulpmill at Fort William, which, though it had substantial help from the Government, is again a product of private enterprise. I believe that with encouragement private enterprise can bring a lot of help to the Highlands and, as often as not, it is the smaller schemes which are most likely to be practicable in the first place; small undertakings, above all, which work in with one another, which link up with other local industries and activities and which are basically suitable to the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles mentioned the herring industry and the need for installing pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
cessing plant to make it worth while. I went last weekend to see a kipper- and salmon-smoking plant in Rothesay which I think does exactly that and which is doing a very good job all round. In particular, it is producing the best kippers and the best smoked salmon I have had for a long time, and haddock as well. But, here again, they are badly hampered by high freight charges because they have to bring a lot of the fish they smoke from as far away as Ayr and Tarbert and are not able to get all the herrings they require locally. This is an enterprise which, with a certain amount of help over freight charges, could develop very extensively. Incidentally, the kippers they produce are not dyed mahogany colour with chemicals and they do not get a lot of high-pressure smoke puffed at them in 20 minutes. They are soaked in brine and hung up to smoke for 20 hours. I can assure the Committee that they do taste very different. Already they are being sent overseas by air and could make a great reputation—in fact, are already doing so—as a luxury product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As another small example from my own experience, there is in the village where I live a firm of joiners which has been established for 140 years. I think they celebrated their 140th anniversary recently. Of late they have launched out as builders and manufacturers of prefabricated bungalows on a large scale and they have an order book which is now permanently full. They are therefore able to employ far more men than before. This is a small village in Argyllshire where the employment given by one firm is an important factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned just now how important it is that these sort of small undertakings should work with one another. I have been able to play a certain part in this myself—and here I declare an interest—as I am the proprietor of the local inn in the village. I have recently expanded this establishment and the work has been done almost entirely by this firm of builders. They have done the building, they have made all the fitted furniture, and, what is more, they have used timber grown locally and sawn and seasoned by the local sawmill. I think it is also possible that some of the people employed in these processes eventually come and spend a certain amount of their wages drinking in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
bar at my hotel. So everybody helps everybody else. And the hotel also helps provide more social amenities in its present form; for instance, we now have a large room for weddings and British Legion dinners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has already been advertising kippers. I think now the advertising is getting much too near his own home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was trying to do was illustrate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Doing it very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was trying to do, without necessarily bringing in a built-in plug, was to illustrate the fact that sometimes these small undertakings can bring a certain amount of prosperity and employment locally. To take one final example of my own, when I started eight years ago I was employing three or four people at the hotel; now, in the season which is getting steadily longer, I am employing nearly 40. This has also helped the firm of joiners and builders to keep going; it has helped the sawmill; it has also helped the Forestry Commission, if it needs it, and it has helped local farmers and food producers—including my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many persons have been engaged by these small industries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am not sure of the exact number employed at the moment by the firm of builders I mentioned, but, at a guess, I should say 20 to 30. What is more, most of us could employ even more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting thing is that whereas the population of a lot of such relatively remote villages in the Highlands has dropped, the population of this one keeps increasing. This also helps to bring amenities for the young people. There are more of them, there is more work for them to do and there is also more for them to do in their spare time and more local amenities. In fact, one could say that in a very small way this village has become a kind of growth point and it does stop young people, especially, from drifting away; and it spares them that feeling of hopelessness which they might otherwise have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
I would conclude by saying that, if we get the right kind of industry, industry that uses the right raw materials and above all industry that works in with local produce, local activities and local enterprise, then there is a very great deal that can be done in this way to help the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am*sure we are indebted to my hon. Friends the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) for putting down these Amendments, which have enabled us to have this very interesting debate on industry in the Highlands. I have no doubt, too, that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) is also indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles, for this has enabled him to make a speech which, as I understood it, he intended to make at another time. It is always handy, of course, to be able to make a speech which one did not expect to get in on one occasion on some other occasion—in other words, to deliver what one has prepared no matter whether the occasion is right or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, this is an important matter, and that is why I thought it was important that we should discuss it, and, along with the members of the Committee who have spoken, I realise its importance. The figures given by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll brought out, I thought, the nature of this problem. Also, by starting with the distribution of employment as between primary industries and manufacturing industries and the possibilities of growth in some of the primary industries, he helped to pinpoint the necessity for industrial growth in the Highland area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great part of this debate was concerned with whether that should be centred around the idea of growth points or whether we should concentrate on the smaller types of growth mentioned by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean). My own view about that is that there is a place for both, as was said by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles, and I do not think it is a matter about which we should do battle. If we can get either, we shall be glad, and we shall try to get both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
I do not wish to devote a great deal of time to this argument as I think it would probably be much better debated on some occasion when we are discussing the Highlands, such as an Estimates debate, or something like that, but I should like to answer one or two of the points which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, I would like to reply to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles concerning the matter that he raised about the report that appeared in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I apologise for not having answered him at Second Reading, but I shall try to do so now. The meeting to which 	<i>The Scotsman</i> report referred was one of a long series of meetings between the Scottish Development Department and the Highland county development officers. These are official meetings; discussion at them is confidential, and no Press report is issued following them, of course. I have had inquiries made, and have confirmation from the chairman of that particular meeting that 	<i>The Scotsman</i> report of what was said at it is quite untrue and that nothing was said at the meeting even to suggest that he Highland Development Board would not take initiatives in the industrial field or that the Board would advise, assist and co-ordinate but not initiate, or that it might be ten years before real expansion took place. I have the minute of that meeting here and there is certainly nothing in it which suggests that anything of that kind was said. In fact, from what was said, according to this report, it would appear that they were rather anxious to get things moving and to get things for the Board to do. Indeed, the impression I gather from this minute of the meeting is rather the opposite of what 	<i>The Scotsman</i> indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank my hon. Friend very much for his statement. I raised the matter again on Tuesday especially because, while I think these meetings of county Departmental officials are excellent and should continue, this did not seem right and it is a great pity that there should have been what now appears to have been an inaccurate report. I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for spelling out the difference between 	<i>The Scotsman</i> report and his account of what actually happened. I accept his explanation, of course, and am extremely glad 	<i>The Scotsman</i> report is untrue. I am sorry to have to say
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
I am pleased to be told it was an inaccurate report, but very glad it is now officially stated to be untrue, because it had worried a lot of people in the Highlands. As to the meetings themselves, I feel that they are of great value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that these are valuable meetings. One has only to read the minutes to see that they should result in the promotion of activities in the Highlands, which of course we want. I am glad to have been able to dispel the idea that the Board would not itself be able to take initiative. This Clause 3 does itself, of course, place on the Board the obligation to do certain things. It says that the Board shall have the duty "to keep under review all matters", and so on; and, after consultation with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands, to prepare and submit proposals to the Secretary of State; and also, in subsection to concert, promote, assist and undertake measures. In other words, the Clause places an obligation on the Board to initiate action and this is followed up by the power given to the Board by Clauses 4, 5 and 7 and subsequent Clauses. The intention is that the Board should initiate action and not simply wait for people to put up ideas. It would not be our view that it should do so, and the Bill endeavours to make it plain that the Board should itself initiate action. It will be its responsibility to do so and that is evident in the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments we are discussing would insert the word "industrial" before the word "economic" in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b).</i> My advice is that doing so would bring into question the meaning of "economic", which is usually understood to embrace industry. If we were to pick out one aspect of economic development we should throw into doubt the meaning of the word "economic" as it would appear in these two subsections. Thus, the Amendments could have a restrictive effect, and I am sure that hon. Gentlemen would not wish that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had arguments of this nature previously in the Committee about specifying certain things in detail as opposed to a general comprehensive phrase. Paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> as drafted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
embraces every aspect. It instructs the Board
	<br><blockquote><p>"to keep under review all matters relating to the economic and social well-being and development of the Highlands and Islands".</p></blockquote>
Nothing could be more embracing than that. By inserting the word "industrial" before the word "economic" we should throw the passage into some doubt—or, at least, there would be the possibility of doing so—and the eventual result might be restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the same time my hon. Friend will recognise that the purpose of the Amendments was to throw the industrial aspect into high relief?.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and I will come to that in a moment. I understand the intention of the Amendment and have a great deal of sympathy with it because I recognise the importance of industry. But by inserting "industrial" in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b)</i> we should be doing something that we do not wish to do.

Paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…from time to time to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for his approval proposals, whether general or specific in character, for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands or any part thereof".</p></blockquote>
That, too, is all embracing. There again, inserting the word "industrial" would throw into doubt the meaning of the word "economic". My advice, therefore, is that we can achieve our objectives without the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of industry is recognised in Clause 6, which is devoted to industry. It would be out of order for me to discuss Clause 6, but it will enable the Board to
	<br><blockquote><p>"acquire or set up and carry on, directly or through an agent, any business or undertaking…</p></blockquote>
Those words provide the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles, who asked whether the Board would be able to set up and carry on. Clause 6 permits the Board to do so, and as we would expect the Board to take the initiative, that is our answer to his cogent arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of my explanation I hope the Amendment moved will be withdrawn. Everything desired by my hon. Friend is already covered. There would be a
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
danger in the Amendment, as I have pointed out. As my hon. Friend has no wish, I am sure, to create such a situation I hope that the Amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To use the quiet phraseology of the Minister of State, his reply is really quite scandalous, if not outrageous. We had a very interesting and useful debate on Tuesday when, in a number of speeches, hon. Gentlemen asked him for some specific ideas, or to let us rather more fully into the ideas which he and the Secretary of State, without being in any way specific, have been telling Scotland as a whole that they have for the development of the Highlands. All that the Minister of State has done in his answer today is to read out bits of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we happen to be considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is typical of an Administration who talk in generalities and never make the slightest attempt to get down to specific points or to make any answer to any reasonable questions they are asked, either by their hon. Friends or by hon. Members on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt that the Minister of State was perhaps helped by the fact that the debate on Tuesday was carried on today. There were a number of perfectly simple questions which I asked him to reply to. If he had been doing his work he would have been able to do that at once. He has had two days in which to consult the Department and make some attempt to reply to those questions. He has made not the slightest effort to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) raised a point which is fully in the minds of almost everyone in the Highlands, whether living there or trying to set up industries there. The hon. Member stated that, in his view, we were within a year or two of being able to get much cheaper electricity from the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. The Secretary of State and the Minister of State have been for six months considering the question of the Hydro-Electric Board and I thought that the Minister of State would have been able to tell us whether this was an accurate forecast by the hon. Member for Inverness.

	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
To leave this sort of statement unanswered and apparently unthought out by the Minister in a Committee which rightly gets publicity in Scottish newspapers seems to me remarkably suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that the word "industrial" would cause some difficulty because it would be restrictive in the sense of limiting the word "economic", but what is more restrictive than a Minister who does not answer a single question on points which are extremely relevant to the whole of Highland development? I asked the hon. Gentleman for an estimate of the number of jobs which in his view need to be created in the Highland area over the next 10 years in order to have a reasonable chance of holding the present population. I am aware that he could not give a firm target. I know that these figures could not be pinned down to the last five, 10 or 100 for that matter. Nevertheless, it is surely an elementary thing that, before the Government bring in a Bill like this or make speeches saying that they will revolutionise the Highland economy, they should have basic ideas and statistics in their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had nothing at all from them about it, either during Second Reading or in this Committee. We have not had a single word of help or advice from the Minister to indicate how the minds of the Government are working, the sort of problems they are to tackle, and how they are to tackle them, it is disgraceful that the Minister of State, having had two days to look at this—the questions were relevant and useful—should not have answered one of them. The simplest question was one which I put. It concerned the number employed now by the Forestry Commission. Surely it would not have been difficult to get the answer to that from the Department? That question is relevant because we should be able to know how the job potential would be affected by expansion of the forestry programme, both by the State and by private interests. But the hon. Gentleman made no answer. The Committee was treated with contempt. I very much regret his attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that during the progress of the Clause a good many of the statistics which the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) wants
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
will come to hand. I agree with their importance. We want to know how many persons are employed at present in various types of industry in the Highlands and I think those figures can be easily acquired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then why did we not get them from the Minister of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a question for me to answer. But if I had wanted the answers to those questions I would have had them. I would have found them for myself. I would not have been so lazy as to sit on my backside and ask someone else for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. But wait a moment. Now I can give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. It may well be that the hon. Member has special methods of finding out what is in the minds of the Secretary of State and the Minister of State, but this is not something that I can sit down and work out. The sort of question I was asking could only be answered by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quarrelling with the right hon. Gentleman. I did not put these questions to the Minister of State. I am interested in another aspect of the Clause and probably we shall come to the answers to the right hon. Gentleman's questions. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we want to know figures of this nature and what numbers the Government are thinking of as possible new entrants into the various industries in the Highlands in the next five years or whatever period we think fit. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Member that this is just the sort of information which we should have and which, to use the Minister of State's favourite phrase, the people of Scotland are entitled to know, but the hon. Member's party must know the answers to all these questions. They promised the electorate of Scotland just before the last Election that the Highland Development Board would provide jobs for everyone in the Highlands and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
for all those who wanted to return. I am sure that the hon. Member and his friends would not have made a promise of that kind without a firm basis of fact. We want to know what those facts are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. Why interrupt me every few minutes to assert something which has already been asserted? I do not want my speech to bump along between interruptions from the party opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has already been interrupted on no fewer than three occasions. Perhaps he might be allowed to continue his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise just one bump from this side, Mr. Steele, and I hope that it bumps in the right direction. How has it been impossible for the last thirteen years for my hon. Friend and others of us to obtain figures, names and the identification of ownership of estates in the Highlands? How has it been quite impossible to extract that information from the party opposite?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Amendment is not about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interruptions certainly were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I reply to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) in the same terms as I replied to his right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll. I am not responsible for the answers to those questions, but in my locker I have a return, published in 1873, which gives a great many of the facts for which hon. Members opposite are searching—and we have had Tory Governments galore during that period of almost a hundred years. They have never produced another return of that nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting very wide of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will agree, Mr. Steele, that I have been provoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing as I saw it when we came to the Clause was that we were
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
faced with a little phrase dealing with the duties of the Board and it seemed important to me to find out something about the duties of the Board. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister of State in what he said and I thank him for his answer. I accept his assurance that as a result of the Amendment, we now know that the Board will take industrial initiative. That is the first thing that we have got as a result of this. The Board is committed and has the power to enter into industrial undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that all this could come up under Clause 6. We recognise that, too, but we felt that when we reached Clause 3 it was important that we should raise it on this Clause, because this was the first opportunity we had in the Bill. It was important that we should raise it, and for these reasons. We are accustomed to talking about the British economy, the Scottish economy and the Highland economy. When the word "economy" is used with a qualifying adjective—for example, British, Highland or Scottish—the connotation of "economy" is social, industrial and economic. Everything is comprehended within the term "British economy" or "Highland economy" if the adjective precedes the word "economy". Clause 3 didn't do that, however. It isolated social and economic; but left out industrial. It became imperative, in our view, to insert "industrial" to get the clarification which my hon. Friend the Minister of State has now given. That did not require any figures at this moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That once again shows the subtle methods of the party opposite which they have employed throughout the Bill, as they themselves must agree—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we get a word in edgeways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—to take away the argument from the basis on which we sought to put it in order to show the exact position of the Board and our purpose in submitting the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State has dealt adequately with the Amendment. While I have had no time to consult my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and dare not commit him, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
must confess that I am satisfied with the explanation given, because I now know that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is committed and has agreed to the course which we have expressed as being that which should be followed in developing the Highlands in the way they should be developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot for one moment agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) that the Minister of State has dealt adequately with the Amendment and I agree profoundly with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has said. What flabbergasts me is how the Minister of State can sit there as he does with his great record when he was on this side of the Committee. In those days, he would sit at the end of the Gangway, his voice would get more and more strident with indignation and he would use the words "monstrous" and "scandalous" and say that the people of Scotland were entitled to know. I wish that I could get the right inflexion in my voice and carry the same weight. That was something to which we all became accustomed. The hon. Gentleman used to say those things on matters that were of considerably less importance than the questions that have been asked about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, however, want merely to score a debating point. I want to put what I believe to be a matter of great seriousness to the Minister: that is, the importance of establishing a good Press for the future of the Highland Development Board, because he will, I am sure, agree that the Board will need all the assistance that it can get to do the extremely difficult and complex task that lies before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I got a considrable shock, as did the hon. Gentleman, when I read that report in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> The Minister has today said, I understand, that there was no truth or substance behind what appeared in the paper. That is surprising when it concerns that particular newspaper. It is not one with which we associate reports that have no substance. The hon. Gentleman says that he has made inquiries, but can he go so far as to say that no interview of any kind was given by anyone who attended that meeting to any reporter from 	<i>The Scotsman?</i> I should be extremely surprised if an interview was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
given and, perhaps, a wrong interpretation gained. As I understand it, the Minister is saying that a reporter from 	<i>The Scotsman</i> used his own imagination to write two items which became front page news and which did enormous damage to the prospects of the Board all over the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, why did not the Minister deny that report almost immediately, when the news was topical and in everybody's mind? Why did he not even take up the point, although it was late then, on Second Reading when it was mentioned? At least, it could have gone on record in the House that here was something which had been said inadvertantly or untruthfully, or however one likes to put it. If this is the way that the Minister handles the Press relations of the Highland Development Board, it begins to make me wonder, terrible thought though it might be, that it might be an improvement to have the Paymaster-General in charge of Press relations in Scotland. It could hardly have been carried out worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is going a bit too far now. I permitted a passing reference to this matter, but I do not want it to go any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be of relief to you, Mr. Steele, to know that I have said all I wanted to say. I think, however, and I hope that the Minister will appreciate, that this is a matter of enormous importance, and it is a subject which has been raised and touched upon. I will leave it at that, Mr. Steele, and bow to your Ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to reply to the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). In the first place, I am surprised that he should not be asking for this information. He was Secretary of State for something like three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly he was. He was Secretary of State for three years. He should know the answers to all these questions. If he did not know the answers to them, clearly he was not doing his job. He could have looked them up at any time he liked. Some of the answers are available in the various reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman knows what he said at our last Sitting. He did not ask me how many people were employed in Forestry. What he asked me was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…if the Minister says, as I hope he will, that employment in forestry is to continue …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee, </i> 6th April, 1965; c. 241.]</p></blockquote>
The question that the right hon. Member asked me three times was what were my ideas about growth points. I answered him during my reply. He then went on to ask me what were the views of my right hon. Friend, who had made a speech twelve days before, and what was in my right hon. Friend's mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not the slightest idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit that I have all sorts of talents, but I was not inside my right hon. Friend's mind at the time he made a speech twelve days ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or in his confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am in his confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman should put down a Question in the House and ask my right hon. Friend, and not me, for an answer. I have answered this only because I want to get it fair. I could make a long speech on industrial and Highland development. The right hon. Member for Argyll was Secretary of State for three years studying this problem. He shakes his head and says, "No". He ought to have been studying it amongst other problems, but at the end of three years, apparently, he had found so few answers that he set up a Study Group to provide him with the answers. If he was prepared to do that, does he not think that we should wait for the answers to be given by that Study Group before we start pontificating about what they might be? That would be a fair enough thing to do. There is nothing unfair about it and nobody is trying to dodge any issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I paid tribute to the right hon. Gentleman's figures during my speech. I pointed out one of the things that emerged from and struck me about the right hon. Gentleman's figures, with which he did not quarrel. He gave a number of figures. In general, I am pre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
pared to accept them. He is, therefore, complaining unfairly about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, as he said himself, he was getting rid of a speech which had been prepared for another occasion. That is how the right hon. Gentleman started his speech. I do not think that he reads the reports of his speeches. If he will look at the OFFICIAL REPORT, at column 237, he will find that he said he had prepared the speech for another occasion. I hardly think he should expect me to devote a long time to answering him. I thought that I acknowledged rather generously the importance of the figures he gave to the Committee. I thought they were important. That was being perfectly fair to the right hon. Gentleman. I apologised to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) because I had not answered him before. One cannot do more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all very well, but all I ask is that the Minister shall pull up his socks and get this important principle better put. Apologising to his hon. Friend does not undo the damage which has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was a garbled report. There were no reporters present at the meeting and no official report of the meeting was given. Someone must have talked to someone else—this is the way these things happen—and this report was then put in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I am not criticising 	<i>The Scotsman</i> for publishing it. That is the job of the journalists, and the way they do it, and one expects this sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a report of two meetings which took place on different days. It has been put into one report. One meeting was of the Scottish Development Department with the development officers of the area and the other a Press interview given by Lord Cameron the following day. That is what this report actually is. In some respects it is not accurate even concerning the Press interview given by Lord Cameron. I am not complaining about that. The matter raised by my hon. Friend was the important matter, the allegation that the Board was to have no initiative. I have answered that categorically this morning, and I hope that my answer will get the same publicity as did the original article. The Bill places on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
the Board the duty to take initiatives. That is the real answer to this article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really cannot allow the Minister of State to try to work his way out of his own incompetence and muddle by blurring the issue with a lot of total irrelevancies, even if they were accurate. The hon. Gentleman said that I had been Secretary of State for three years which even for his limited mind must be regarded as a remarkable degree of inaccuracy. The period from 1962 to 1964—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two or three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:s—is a period of two years, although two years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seemed a lot longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—is a long period to ask the Minister of State to get right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next part of his argument was that at the end of the alleged three-year period I set up a Study Group to look at the Highland problem. If the hon. Gentleman will consult the records in his own office he will find that the Study Group was set up a long time before the end of my tenure of office—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Towards the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and he will also know that its report was due back to me in the spring of this year. It is very likely that the hon. Gentleman could talk to people in his own Department, and have access to the work they are doing, and could get from them at least the basic figures for which I asked. They are not figures which I could get. I cannot go to talk to people in his Department—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman could have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and ask them how they are getting on. The hon. Gentleman has had two whole days to do this, which is quite long enough for him to get some figures from his Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the figures which the right hon. Gentleman wants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Things like the number of jobs necessary to maintain the population in the Highlands, which is the sort of thing we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
I really do not think that the Minister of State is doing his job by the Highlands by merely bringing in a Bill with apparently no thought behind it at all, and no attempt whatever to explain to this Committee, to the House of Commons, or to Scotland what his intentions are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the view expressed by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) in his last few words. I should have been content if the right hon. Gentleman, in the first few months of his own tenure of office as Secretary of State for Scotland, had produced a Bill of this kind—or if any of his predecessors had done so. We would have supported him. The Liberal Party would have supported him. The right hon. Gentleman would have found no opposition anywhere. Regarding the subject of the Amendment, he would have found enthusiastic support for what we are here trying to do to ensure that the Board will not be precluded from taking direct action by way of industrial initiatives. Surely this is something new for the Highlands and something for which my hon. Friend should not be criticised as he has been criticised this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a later Amendment on the Notice Paper, No. 19, in page 2, line 28, in the name of the right hon. Member for Argyll, to leave out "or undertake" and to insert "in the undertaking of". This shows that the right hon. Member for Argyll and his hon. Friends are fully aware of the significance of the debate about industrial activity by that Board, on Tuesday and today. By his Amendment he would deprive the Board of the right to undertake almost any economic activity and would merely give it the job of helping other private enterprise people along the road—if ever any such people came along that road. That has been the trouble; the private enterprise people have not come in sufficient numbers in the past. If they had we might not now be finding it necessary to set up a Development Board with powers to do all those things which have not been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) leaves out of account a word in subsection (1,	<i>c</i>) the word "promote".

No one would quarrel with that. Surely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We will deal with that Amendment when we come to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Steele, I do not wish to refer to that Amendment in detail. I mentioned it only to show that the subject of our Amendments has obviously bulked fairly large in the mind of the right hon. Gentleman. Obviously he is well aware of the industrial action point. That is why he has taken action in the opposite direction in order to try to frustrate the Board in respect of the very things which we want it to be able to do, to undertake industrial development direct if need be.

Those of us who have had anything to do with the Press, in our capacity as Members of Parliament or of advisory bodies for the Highlands, have found the Press to be extremely fair and helpful. There were Press conferences under my own chairmanship of the Highland Panel after every meeting, as I think is still, the case under Lord Cameron, and I cannot remember a single occasion when there was wilful distortion of any kind, or even a serious mistake made through inefficiency. We had the co-operation of the Press and I hope that will be maintained in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This unfortunate lapse in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> may well have arisen from either of two reasons: someone may have "leaked" at or after the first meeting or, at the second—the Panel Press conference—someone may have referred to something or replied to reporters on the assumption that it had already been openly spoken about. It may well have been accepted by Panel spokesmen that certain things had been officially communicated to the Press from the meeting of County and Department officials. The Panel might well assume from Press questions that certain normally confidential matters were on this occasion known to the Press. The situation could have arisen very easily in that way. We have, however, been fortunate in respect of the Highland Press and the Scottish Press generally in relation to Highland affairs and the work of the Highlands and Islands Panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather surprised when the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
Stodart) castigated the Minister, asking why he did not give an answer earlier about 	<i>The Scotsman</i> report, and why no protest was made immediately after the report appeared. But why, may I ask, did not the Tory Party itself protest before? Why did they not protest at all? This is the first time that they have ever protested. There has been no public indication that they had seen or objected to the report, and the content of Amendment No. 19 suggests that they are in line with the attitude ascribed to the officials in the misreporting. In Amendment 19, they propose one of the very things which formed the subject of the report: they are in sympathy with the view that the Board should not undertake industrial initiatives. That may well be the reason why the Tory Party did not protest, but I think that today hon. Members opposite have protested a little too much about other people not protesting, when in fact those other people are the only ones who did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an Amendment down on the Notice Paper to Clause 6 on the point about industrial activity by the Board and it is more precise and impinges directly on this point. I hope that the Minister will give an undertaking to think about that later carefully, and favourably. That would enable me to thank him all the more cordially for the very forthright and reassuring statement which he has made that the Board can engage in industrial operations itself. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 75, in page 2, line 20, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(b)</i> to consult at regular intervals with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and adjacent areas and with other such bodies as appear to the Board to be appropriate.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will be convenient for the Committee to discuss, at the same time, Amendments No. 78, No. 76, No. 68 and No. 79.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be satisfactory, Mr. Steele, because Amendment No. 75 is closely associated with No. 76. Together they would redraft this part of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three reasons, which I will explain, why we would prefer the wording we have suggested. As the Clause is at present worded, it appears that the consultation is to take place only
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
We suggest the change proposed in this Amendment for the following three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is ambiguity in the present wording, The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appears to the Board to be appropriate"</p></blockquote>
could refer only to "other bodies", which could simply be qualifying those two words which the passage follows. However, it could also refer to local authorities in the Highlands and Islands. Therefore, it could be that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
could qualify the whole of the passage;
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
years"—five years onwards, not a year or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the word "industrial" be there inserted:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 13, Noes 14.</p>
	<p>local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other bodies which
	<br><blockquote><p>"appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>We wish to make it clear that it is a duty for consultation to take place with the local authorities and that there should be no question of its appearing
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Thus, our first object is to make it quite clear that there should be no ambiguity in this subsection.</p>
	<p>The second reason is that the wording which we suggest in the new paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> in this Amendment include the words "and adjacent areas" so that it would not only be the local authorities in the designated areas of the Highlands and Islands but also adjacent authorities who, our discussions have already shown, could be very much concerned with projects the Board might have in mind.</p>
	<p>The third, perhaps most important, reason is that we consider that there should be a separate, positive duty on the Board to consult local authorities. One hopes that in most cases there would be general agreement, on projects which were being considered, that they would be good for the area, but I am sure that all hon. Members can visualise occasions when local authorities—county I councils or burgh councils—might well be anxious about the effects of some project. Something that might be good for one area might not have completely good effects for another, and there must be the maximum of good will and co-operation from the local authorities concerned if these projects and schemes are to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
meet with approval and general good will in the area.</p>
	<p>To give an example of the kind of thing which might happen—and this will particularly interest the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston)—for many years there have been suggestions put forward for the drainage of the Upper Spey valley because this would bring into wider and better cultivation land in Badenoch, land which is often flooded and which can be used only in part at present. However, such a scheme would cause considerable anxiety to those lower down the Spey, on lower Speyside, because it has been found in the past that when drainage is improved in the upper reaches of a very fast flowing river like this, very much more flooding is caused in the lower reaches after heavy rainfalls because the water comes through in a shorter space of time.</p>
	<p>I give this as an example. I am not saying that good schemes would be held up or need not be effective; but, clearly, at least two county councils, as well as other burgh councils, would be very concerned on lower Speyside if a scheme of the type I have described were being considered in Strathspey. It is essential, therefore, that local authorities should be consulted, so that they can all work out the best scheme and consider the necessary safeguards to ensure that something which will be good for one area will not have an adverse effect on another, a perhaps unintentional effect but one which could occur if the scheme were not worked out thoroughly beforehand.</p>
	<p>It should be remembered that the importance of this is psychological, too, so that those who feel that their interests might be damaged would not automatically get together and be against a scheme which intrinsically would probably be a useful one. The example I gave illustrates the kind of difficulties one might find. I am sure that all hon. Members are able to think of similar examples and occasions where some scheme or enterprise in the Highlands might have effects which local authorities would want to consider carefully before being put into effect.</p>
	<p>I emphasise again that there would be no question of holding up a sound development project. It is merely a
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
matter of ensuring that the local authorities likely to be concerned are able to voice their views and that their views will be fully taken into account before a scheme is put into effect.</p>
	<p>We would, therefore, prefer the wording suggested in the Amendments and we cannot see why the Government should not accept our suggestion. In our view the important thing is that it should be regarded as a definite duty on the Board to have regular consultations with the local authorities and that it should not be put in simply incidentally, as it at present occurs in paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> as
	<br><blockquote><p>"such consultation … appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The wording as it stands would enable the Board, as I see it, not necessarily to consult at all if it thought that consultation would not be appropriate. We want to make it more clearly a duty on the Board to consult the local authorities.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider that the paragraph we are discussing is, as drafted, grammatically awkward nd could lead to some ambiguity. I agree to that extent with the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). My Amendment, No. 68, is rather more than a drafting one because it seeks to remove some of the verbosity and ambiguity. I am not quite sure what the subsection means as it is at present drafted. Does "appropriate" refer to the consultations or to the bodies? My Amendment is designed to make it clear that it refers to "appropriate bodies".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the advisability of consulting at regular intervals, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, I would consider that a restrictive addition. It would involve the Board in undertaking consultations presumably at specified times. I would prefer to leave the Board to exercise its own judgment as to when and with whom it should consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no quarrel with the words in the subsection on this issue, and nor do I have any quarrel with the present wording relating to consultations with local authorities. Considering the wording of Amendment No. 75, I suggest that if the Board considers them "appropriate bodies" there would be nothing to prevent it from consulting such bodies. The wording of the Amendment would appear, therefore, to be irrelevant in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
circumstances. As I say, I am anxious to know whether the word "appropriate" refers to the consultations or bodies with which the consultations are undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely support the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) in his attempt to get this very bad example of verbiage cleared up, and I also think that the sense of this sentence as it would be amended by him has much to commend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not agree with him, however, that the wording here, as far as it is possible to interpret it, could possibly mean anything except "such" means consultation which "appears to the Board to be "appropriate" because the word "such" is linked with the word "consultation", and the verb, when one eventually finds it, is in the singlar, and that surely makes that quite clear. It is not just a question of
	<br><blockquote><p>"…as appears to the Board to be appropriate …."</p></blockquote>
but "such bodies" as are appropriate. I do not like the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"such consultation as appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
I would much sooner that the consultation could be taken for granted and that we should have the words "consultation with the appropriate bodies" and leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I largely agree with the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. I largely agree with the remarks of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). He made the very fair point about adjacent authorities and the need to bring them into consultation. He adduced an extremely good example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Amendment standing in my name, Amendment No. 78, which should be considered with Amendment No. 75, I have two points to make. The first is the question of consultation and the second is the question of the submission of proposals. In regard to the former, I think the Minister will probably agree to look at this again; I certainly hope so, and that would satisfy me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, I believe that the point about adjacent local authorities is a fair
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
one and ought to be written in. Secondly, I do feel that since we have set up a Highlands and Islands Consultative Council we ought to mention it at this juncture. It may not be necessary legally; I am not quite sure about that; but I should have thought that as it had been set up in Clause 2 it ought to be mentioned in Clause 3(1,	<i>b</i>) that the Council would be consulted. I am not prepared to argue strongly on this, but I should have thought it ought to be mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I should have thought that as well as having the right to consult bodies and local authorities the Board might also have the power to consult individual persons who had special or particular knowledge, if it so wished. It may have this power already. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), who unfortunately is not with us, has from time to time made the point that any individual in a democratic society has a right to consult, and so on, so the Board may well have the right also. Perhaps the Minister would clear up that point for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the question of "consultation as appears appropriate". I must confess that I was rather confused in my own interpretation of what this meant. The Minister will note that the wording which I have used in my Amendment is really exactly the same as his own, and I must say I did tend to think that the meaning was "such other bodies as appears appropriate to the Board". I see quite clearly from the remark made by the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) that this is not correct and that it does in fact mean that the Board will only consult local authorities if it considers it appropriate to do so. I would have thought that to be the intention, if not necessarily the specific words, of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn the fact being that there should certainly be some means of making consultation of local authorities obligatory at certain stages or at least making the Board undertake such consultation, not leaving it in such a vague situation that the Board could ignore the local authorities altogether. I think that is a perfectly clear and valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that first question and turning to the second, I do not want to go into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
this very deeply because I think I can bring out the point adequately when we come to deal with Amendment No. 80. I am glad they are not being taken together but I will not pursue this particular aspect very far except to indicate what I am trying to do in the second part of my Amendment in which I talk about submitting to the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"a long-term plan for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
I am trying to get over this very real problem of separating general and specific as laid down in paragraph 	<i>(b),</i> which says that the Board will
	<br><blockquote><p>"prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for his approval proposals, whether general or specific in character…"</p></blockquote>
I think we must make some attempt during the Committee to differentiate here and to free the Board from day-today supervision by the Secretary of State or his Department. Without the slightest offence to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Mac-Arthur), it would appear that if he wished to arrange for the construction of a public lavatory at Glenshee he would have to refer his specific proposal back to the Secretary of State, which would be ludicrous. So I am trying to separate general and specific, so that, in the case of general, long-term and wider planning the Secretary of State has direct supervision, but the Board would have a degree of independence in terms of specific cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am all for long-term planning and I think it would be helpful if we could have an assurance from the Minister that the Board would be given directions in general terms by the Secretary of State to draw up as and when practicable a long-term plan. But I do not know what will be achieved by leaving out paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> in the course of this Amendment. If that is done, some very important and immediate tasks and duties of the Board will be omitted. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other bodies as appears to the Board to be appropriate, from time to time to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for his approval proposals, whether general or specific in character, …"</p></blockquote>
It might well be that in trying to achieve the purpose of getting the Board to un-
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
dertake long-term plans we would cancel instructions to get on with immediate proposals. That would be the effect of omitting paragraph 	<i>(b).</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To answer the hon. Gentleman briefly, I think that if he reads Amendment No. 80, although I am not saying my wording is perfect, he will see that it does allow for specific measures to be undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty is that if I voted for this Amendment as it stands—which is all I can do now—it would mean that I accepted at the same time the elimination of paragraph 	<i>(b),</i> and that would wipe out the Board's responsibility for making development and other proposals general and specific in character, and so on. That would be a revolutionary alteration of the Bill, and, taken on its own and separately from consideration of Amendment 80, it would be disastrous in its effect. I am explaining my difficulty on paragraph 	<i>(b),</i> because I have a lot of sympathy with the long-term suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say on that point that long-term planning necessarily takes a long time and is a big job. I agree that the Consultative Council should be brought in on long-term planning and if there is going to be a direction from the Secretary of State about long-term planning by the Board, then, of course, the Consultative Council would be brought into it, because that, after all, is what is meant by consulting the wishes of the Highland and Island people in general whom we hope to see represented on the Council. It seems safe to assume that, if we got the assurance about long-term planning, the Consultative Council would almost certainly have to be brought in, although I see no harm in making sure they are mentioned and given all the status possible from the start. I would stress the fact, however, that, while I think the long-term planning, is important, my emphasis would be on getting on with the immediate and urgent jobs—because hundreds of local and other problems have been investigated and reported on already and recommendations made for their solution. So, while I would like some assurance on long-term planning I would much rather lay heavy emphasis on getting on quickly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
and full-time with what is mentioned in paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> That explains my diffidence in taking any risks about wiping out paragraph 	<i>(b),</i> a diffidence with which I am sure hon. Gentlemen must surely agree. So I should certainly not support the elimination of paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> but would say yes to a long-term plan and consultation with the Consultative Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that probably most hon. Gentlemen will agree that an Amendment to the Clause as it stands is necessary because there is ambiguity about what the word "appropriate" applies to, and on this I agree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). Personally, I think that the Amendment proposed by my hon. Friend is the one which I prefer, because it does include in addition something which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West, has not included, ond that it is the question of consultation at regular intervals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has said that he thinks this is restrictive. I take the point, but there is one thing which is of great importance, and it has been emphasised by the Minister in the consultations which I know he has had in the north, and in newspaper reports which, we hope, were not inaccurate, and which described him as having emphasised the importance of the Board's fitting in with the local authorities and how there was to be no attempt to override the local authorities and that this was going to be quite a difficulty. In this he echoed the words of the Royal Commission ten years ago which made this one of its objections, if not the main objection, to the formation of a Highland Development Board, because it found it hard to see how it was to dovetail with the work of the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This being so, and with the Minister's own appreciation of the problem, I should have thought it was of the greatest importance that they should consult at regular interevals. I think it is of enormous importance in a new conception such as this to carry people with us, to bring them into the picture, and I believe it would be right to do so at regular intervals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "regular intervals" are not specified. It is not as though one said "every month" or "every fort-
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
night". It could be every quarter. I am quite certain one could leave it to the good sense of the Board what the intervals would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. That is the point. It could be every three years and still conform to the Amendment. My point was that one had to leave it entirely to the initiative of the Board and its good sense, as the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I grant to the hon. Gentleman that this could in fact be so, but I think that "regular intervals", although that could mean three years, would certainly put into the head of the Board the idea that the intervals should be much shorter. I am sorry we disagree, but "regular intervals" means, I would say, once a quarter rather than once every three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is proper that we should write this into the Bill and I hope the Minister will regard this as an essentially helpful move to help him in his campaign to reassure local authorities that it is indeed the desire of the Board to carry the local authorities with them and bring them into the picture on every possible occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point, made by two or three hon. Gentlemen was that there was a certain ambiguity in the first two or three lines of the paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other bodies as appears to the Board to be appropriate …</p></blockquote>
There should not be any ambiguity because the word "appears" applies to a singular noun, not to a plural. Therefore it must as it stands, and as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) said, apply to "such consultation" and could not possibly apply to "local authorities" and "other bodies". Therefore I do not think that that particular argument is quite sound. I must admit that for a time I thought the same as the hon. Gentleman who raised this point—that it was ambiguous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly my point. Because the word "such" appears before "consultation" it covers consultation with local authorities and other bodies. If the word "such"
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
appeared before "other bodies", as we have put it, it would be clear that it would be the other bodies with whom consultation should be held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is rather a different point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the point I raised at the beginning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point raised by some hon. Members concerned the ambiguity in connection with consultations. The phrase in the Clause, "after such consultation" means "after such consultation"—that is to say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation … as appears to the Board to be appropriate"</p></blockquote>
for the purpose it has in mind at the time. I am not altogether impressed by the arguments claiming ambiguities in this provision. The subsection is really quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 would place an additional duty on the Board to have regular consultations not only with the local authorities within the area but also with other bodies it might consider appropriate. We should think carefully before asking the Board to do that. I had an open mind on this, but I believe that the arguments are against it on the whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1,	<i>b</i>) provides that, in preparing its proposals, the Board must consult—or should consult as it finds necessary—the local authorities or other bodies which seem to have an interest in those proposals. We have no reason to assume that the Board will not do its job properly and, therefore, it will inevitably be involved in considering, initiating and administering a variety of projects concerning the economic and social development of the Highlands. In practice, therefore, it will be frequently in touch with the local authorities and other bodies with an interest in the development of the Highland area. Where such proposals have a bearing on the interests of local authorities in adjacent areas, then one would expect the Board also to consult them. That is implicit in subsection (1,	<i>b</i>). It would also be open to the local authorities, whether in the Highlands or adjacent
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
areas, to see the Board concerning any matters affecting them, and that does not require any provision in the Bill to be made possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind that there will be a regular exchange of ideas, and regular consultations, and one imagines that, arising from these, the Board will be well in touch with the views of the local authorities. The purpose of the Amendment might simply be to ensure the exchange of ideas at regular intervals—which might be as long a period as two years or, on the other hand, might be a few months—but we should bear in mind that we are setting up a Highland Development Consultative Council on which local authorities and other major interests in the Highlands and Islands will be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Consultative Council will provide the machinery through which such interests can make their views and opinions known at frequent and regular intervals. The local authorities and other bodies will find that the Consultative Council will be adequate for making their views known to the Board. If we duplicated the machinery by making other meetings obligatory or mandatory we would run the danger of reducing the status of the Consultative Council. In those circumstances, we would not get on the Council the type of person we would like. That is a real danger and one that we should guard against. We do not want to make too many channels, and the Amendment would simply be a duplication of something already available, which would have a bad effect on the Consultative Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, we would not improve the Bill by making the Amendment. I agree with its purpose and with what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) said about the necessity for keeping in touch with the local authorities in the Highlands and for giving the assurance that we do not intend to cut across their activities or powers and that we shall consult them. But the Amendment would not help. It would not improve the Bill, and should not be accepted unless rather different arguments from those we have heard are advanced.

Amendment No. 68, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
West (Mr. William Hamilton) would make subsection (1,	<i>b</i>) read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other appropriate bodies, from time to time to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for his approval proposals…"</p></blockquote>
This would largely deprive the Board of any discretion in the matter of consultation with local authorities and other bodies. I am sorry to inform my hon. Friend that the Amendment would do rather more than wipe out what he called unnecessary verbiage. It would have a material effect. The Amendment would deprive the Board of discretion in consulting local authorities and other bodies. We believe that this would give rise to a great deal of unnecessary and irrelevant consultations. We must bear in mind that the area is extensive and that, if the Board is operating, for instance, in Argyll, it seems unnecessary for it to have to ask for consultations with the Orkneys and Shetlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I am wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that my hon. Friend is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsection would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other appropriate bodies, from time to time…"</p></blockquote>
I had in mind some of the arguments which had been advanced about regular meetings with the Highlands and Islands local authorities. But the main point is that the Amendment would take from the Board its discretion in this matter and that would not be wise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 78, standing in the name of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) would have the Board
	<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation with the Highlands and Islands Consultative Council, local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other bodies and persons as appear to the Board to be appropriate, to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State a long-term plan for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) is correct. We do not want the Board to get bogged down in the preparation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
yet another long-term plan. We already have a Study Group examining the area for the purpose of preparing a report which we hope will contain the necessary information and data on which a plan for the area can be based. That is already going on, and will, of course, be considered by the Scottish Economic Planing Council, and taken into account in the preparation of the overall plan for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of all this, it would be unnecessary for the Board itself to embark at once upon the preparation of a long-term plan. We want to see the Board get on with a few specific projects at once. We have it in mind that the Board should make some progress very shortly after it is established with new projects in the Highlands. Quite a number of proposals have been put before my right hon. Friend and others in the past and are being considered. The Board, therefore, can get to work right away. That is the right course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Board will plan its work in due course, and part of the job of the Economic Planning Council is to provide a plan for Scotland and its various areas. The Board will play a part in the preparation of such a plan. Indeed, the Chairman of the Board will be a member of the Economic Planning Council. Thus, the work mentioned by the hon. Member for Inverness will be done without being specifically mentioned in the Bill. It is the job of the Economic Planning Council. It would be wrong specifically to direct the Board in the Bill to prepare a long-term plan. Rather do we want it to get on with some specific projects. For these reasons I would not like to see the Amendment made to the Clause. I am sure that, like us, the hon. Gentleman wants to see things happening rather than have the Board waste another two years or so preparing yet another long-term plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the Minister of State has been saying. I am quite prepared to admit that this is probably not a very good way of putting it. But would he comment on the specific point I am getting at—the question of proposals by the Board, general or specific? I want to make some differentiation between the two which will be clear. Inevitably, the Board will be involved in establishing a long-term plan,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
along with the regional study and possibly in relation with the Economic Planning Council. Presumably the Board will shape a long-term plan for the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is bound to, in the nature of things. But we have a Study Group which will submit proposals concerning the north of Scotland. Those proposals will go to the Economic Planning Council and to the Board because they will probably contain ideas and suggestions about things which can be done. The Planning Council will want to process those proposals along with other reports from the area and, as a result of its own studies, will prepare a development plan for Scotland as a whole. On that basis, a plan will be prepared for the Highland area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to link the two together, the Chairman of the Board will be a member of the Planning Council. As a result of activities now in progress, a plan will be prepared for the Highlands. In these circumstances it would be wrong to lay down specifically that the Board must get on with the formulation of such a plan. A long-term plan is inevitable anyway. The Board will, in its own interests, promote such a plan within the framework of the Planning Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also anxious to avoid the Board getting bogged down once again in studies. As the hon. Member will agree, there have been a large number of studies of the Highlands, producing all sorts of recommendations, many of which are very good. What we want now is a Board which will get on with the work and as quickly as possible. That is why we would not wish to see the hon. Gentleman's Amendment made to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most hon. Members, from both sides, who have spoken on this group of Amendments have appeared to agree that there is ambiguity in paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> We are grateful to the Minister of State for interpreting it. He has done so in the way which, we thought, was the proper reading of it. To us, however, it is the wrong way, because, as I pointed out in my intervention, "such" before "consultation" means that consultation with the local authorities and any other bodies is all qualified by
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
This means that if the Board had a pet project on which it was keen, although it might be in touch with the local authority in the arae of the project, there would be no obligation on it to consult other local authorities which would be affected. We consider it important that there should be regular consultation with local authorities and that this should be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pointed out that we are setting up a Consultative Council. Clearly, if that Council is to be representative by having a large measure of local authority representation, the matter could be raised in and representations made to the Council. There is also the safeguard that if a project affects several authorities the Board's proposals must also go before the Secretary of State for approval. Clearly, the Secretary of State would ask whether the local authorities whose interest might be very much affected had been consulted. No matter what Government are in power, that is the question that a Secretary of State asks. He asks what the local authorities think about a proposal and whether they have accepted it and agreed to it. We have safeguards in that direction. That is why I have put the point that we should be careful about duplicating committees, which tends only to lower their status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says brings us right back to one of our main criticisms of the Bill, that he contemplates everything coming back to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I said "Consultative Council".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State in these circumstances would act as a longstop and would have to say, "Have you consulted all the local authorities concerned?" probably fairly late in the formulation of a scheme, which would be a great waste of time. We think that early on, when schemes are being considered, there should be regular consultation so that local authorities are aware that something is coming up, should know that their interests will be involved, and should have the chance to put their views at a much earlier stage than when a scheme, which might take several months to formulate, is put to the Secretary of State for his agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
In the example which I gave of the Spey Valley, in which I was glad to find the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) agreeing with me as a good example, the Board could with great enthusiasm and eagerness try to do something for part of the Highland area as designated in Clause 1, but unless there were special arrangements in the scheme it might not be fully aware of the damage which could ensue for two counties outside the designated area. The two county councils, to which I referred which would have great anxiety and wish to put forward their views, are at present outside the area. It could well be that the Board would think that its primary purpose was to carry out a scheme for the area which was its own concern, and hang the adjacent areas. I am putting it bluntly, but that is the kind of conflict of interest which could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider that if the wording of our proposed paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> were written into the Clause, ensuring that there would be regular consultation with local authorities in the Highlands and Island areas as well as adjacent areas, the danger of a situation like that arising and having to be sorted out at a late stage, in the formulation of a scheme would be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned this during my speech. The Board can, of course, consult the local authorities outside its own area. There is nothing to prevent that. One would assume that an intelligent Board, anxious to clear the way ahead, would do that. Anybody with knowledge of trying to organise a project such as drainage of the upper reaches of the Spey Valley knows that if it is to go ahead with it, the Board would want to avoid having trouble later on. That is how the hon. Gentleman would act if he were a member of a board of that character. He would say to himself that he must see ahead a little. He would not want to be held up by Moray and Nairn or some other area coming along later to protest. So he would see the people from the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that the Board is so ill-advised or unwise as not to see the people from the area. The county councils themselves can see the Board and make representations to it. There is nothing to prevent this. There is, therefore, a channel of communication, representation and consultation, which would ob-
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
viate the difficulty that the hon. Member foresees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask ourselves whether a further answer should be supplied by making it obligatory for the Board to have regular meetings with all the county councils and those in the adjacent areas for this purpose. That is what the hon. Gentleman wants. I cannot see much point in having people from Orkney, Shetland, Argyll and all sorts of other places coming along to discuss a drainage scheme for the Spey Valley. It does not make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may go on with my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply wanted to put these points, because the hon. Gentleman asked me about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is reading far more into our Amendment. In his earlier speech—I noted his words—he said that there would be regular consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be going on all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend that it should be written into the Bill. We have no intention of having a meeting of all the local authorities on every occasion. As long as there is regular, consultation with each of the local authorities and the Board, whether bilateral or multilateral, that would be the intention of our Amendment. We want to avoid a situation where a local authority, either within the area or in an adjacent area, might find months passing without being kept informed or consulted by the Board, whether direct or by a meeting of several local authorities. We certainly should not suggest that representatives of Orkney and Shetland should attend a general meeting because a scheme was being arranged which would affect about three of the counties and the local authorities within them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister himself has said, that there will be regular consultation, our intention is that this should be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is written in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logical conclusion of the Minister's argument is that there is no need for legislation at all.

	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
Apparently, if a board is set up and its members are well chosen, sensible, and do a good job, there is little need of an Act of Parliament to govern what they are doing. Our job as legislators, however, is to try to produce the regulations and guidance which will set the course for the activities of the Board. We have agreed in previous discussions that a great deal will depend upon the qualifications and ability of the members of the Board—we agree that that is important—but, none the less, we cannot opt out of our duty to make the Bill as clear and as good as we can, so that when the Board is set up it knows without ambiguity what it is expected to do and it will not have to look up the record of a meeting here to see that the Minister has said that there will be regular consultation. We think that it should be written into the Bill in the way we have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife West (Mr. William Hamilton) made a point which I well understood. He suggested that the wording of our Amendment No. 75 might be restrictive because to say that there should be consultation at regular intervals might discount the consultation which should be taking place on particular projects and schemes. This need not be an objection, because we would be content that it should be written in that there should be regular consultation, recognising that as individual schemes arise which directly affect local authorities the Board would be getting in touch with them. We want to ensure that all these authorities are consulted and that the duty should be laid upon the Board to consult them at regular intervals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What kind of project do the hon. Member and his hon. Friends have in mind which would not need consultation with local authorities? Would it be some kind of promotion or enterprise which did not require services, housing or what have you? Can the hon. Gentleman give me an idea of what he is talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I will give an example straightaway. It could be an extension to winter sports facilities, a tourist installation of that kind, where the road already exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No drainage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no drainage is required for that. I am delighted to be able to give that example straightaway. I give it off the cuff. That is something which might, at first sight, not appear to have a direct interest for a number of local town councils. This is simply an example which does not directly affect the housing situation. No doubt one can think of others, but this does not in any way deflect from my point about the need for regular consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear what consultation the hon. Gentleman desires. Is it about projects, or is it statutory regular consultation at three-monthly or six-monthly intervals of all the local authorities? If not of all the local authorities, of whom there are a very large number, then what particular local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to make clear that we did not expect a plenary meeting of all the local authorities concerned at regular intervals but that we thought that the Board should be in touch, either in writing or at meetings, with all the local authorities in the area and the adjacent areas at regular intervals so that no local authority could discover by chance six months or a year later that something was being done by the Board 50 or 100 miles away which had an effect upon its area. I tried to make this clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) appears to be asking for something which would defeat his own purpose. Many times I have heard hon. Members opposite say that they want more power for the Board, but the Amendment would restrict the Board's power, because it requires regular consultation with all local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and adjacent areas. That is a very large number of local authorities. It is a very small Board that we require and to which we have agreed. Therefore, a considerable amount of its time will be taken up either by routine meetings or correspondence with all these local authorities. Obviously, there will be a lot less time to do the job which the Board is to be set up to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) no doubt realises that in almost all cases where we state that, for example, the Secretary of State shall consult, it does not mean that he should do so in person. It could refer to his officials, or to junior Ministers. So the fact, as I understand it, that we state that the Board shall consult does not mean that the five or six members of the Board would have to attend meetings of county councils to discuss matters, and I think that the hon. Member for Dundee, West, is on a bogus point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may think that, but I am talking about what appears in the Amendment. It may be that members of the Board, or employees of the Board, would be concerned, but that would merely add unnecessarily to the expense. A considerable organisation would have to be set up in order that this could be done. If it is not the members of the Board who will go for consultations, it will mean that two or three meetings will have to be held instead of one. If a clerk employed by the Board attended the local council meeting in, for example, Cambeltown, in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, he would have no power to take any decisions, but would have to go back to consult the Board, and consult the local authority again later. This would not save time or facilitate the carrying out of the work for which the Board is to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that what is asked for in the Amendment would clearly hamper the work of the Board. In my opinion, it would be more reasonable if, when the Board had a specific project in mind, it consulted the local authorities affected. If the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) thinks that a vast new scheme affecting more than one local authority in the Highlands would go unnoticed by other local authorities, he must think that the Board will be far more successful than anyone imagines, because an item of that kind would be known about throughout the whole of the Highland area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. It is not the vast schemes about which I am worried, it is the small schemes which may have
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
an effect on the area of a neighbouring authority, for the very reason which he has given. I gave an example just now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is what the hon. Member has in mind, surely the sensible thing would have been to have put down an Amendment along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what this Amendment seeks to do. It seeks to impose a duty on the Board or its officers or employees to consult at regular intervals every local authority in the Highlands and Islands and adjacent areas as well. That seems to me a severe obligation to impose, which must hamper constructive work on developing the Highlands, and therefore I feel that to accept the Amendment would defeat the purpose which the hon. Member has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, hon. Members opposite have no faith in local authorities. How often when he was in Opposition did we hear the Minister of State tell my right hon. Friend to trust the local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, Mr. Steele, but hon. Members opposite are objecting to the Board consulting local authorities. We have just been listening to the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) speaking about the waste of time which would result from consulting local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never heard anything like it. This Board is to be set up by the Secretary of State. There will be no popular election. These supermen will be chosen by the Secretary of State and will be above the local authorities. The hon. Member has told us that it would be a waste of time for the Board to consult local authorities. Why should not the Board consult local authorities? In every

	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
little locality in the Highlands the people who know most about the hopes and aspirations which exist there are the members of the local authority. Will the Board have such superior wisdom that its members will know more, far more, about such little localities than do the local authorities?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled on this matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Steele, could you give the Committee a little more guidance? I may have misunderstood the wording, but in subsection (1, 	<i>b</i>) there is no obligation placed on the Board to consult local authorities. The obligation is to consult local authorities in a manner which appears to the Board to be appropriate. Surely there is a difference? In the Amendment we are discussing an obligation is placed on the Board to have consultations, and I submit, with respect, that this is a point of some substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to my point, with respect to you, Mr. Steele, the Bill makes perfectly clear that the Board can make proposals after such consultation with local authorities as would appear to the Board to be appropriate. It seems appropriate to me that there should be a statutory duty on the Board to consult individual local authorities. That would not be difficult. Anyone with experience of the relationship between local government and the Secretary of State will know that there is no reason why the Board should not call in local authority representatives for consultation. To me it would appear essential that there should be a definite duty placed on the Board to consult local authorities. The Bill does not make clear that there is any obligation on the Board to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Highlands is a large area, and there is no communication of interest between, for example, Campbeltown and Stromness. If the Board is to gain a correct picture of the situation it must have regular consultations with local authorities in different parts of the area. It may well be that Kirkwall Town Council has some point it would like to put to the Board, but as the Bill is drafted, the Board would not need to listen to Kirkwall Town Council.

The Amendment would place a duty on the Board to go to local authorities to ascertain their views. The local authorities know far better than anyone else what are the needs of the areas they represent, and they could advise the Board. I feel very strongly about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister to give an undertaking to look again at the earlier wording of this subsection. It seems to me that there are certain things which hon. Members wish to put into the Clause but the difficulty is to find the appropriate words with which to do so. Arguments have been adduced against the Amendment of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) with regard to regular meetings. It was defended by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) who said that he was not referring to plenary sessions. It may be that that could be read into the Amendment. I still think that the objective, to ensure that there is a regular flow of information, and that on a specific project the local authorities concerned, and adjacent authorities who might be affected, should be consulted, would be in a sense a duty rather than an indefinite obligation. I think the words ought to be examined, and perhaps the Minister might also give an answer about whether the Highlands and Island Consultative Council should be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an obligation placed on the Board under the Bill to present proposals after such consultation as appears to the Board to be appropriate. That is the specific obligation placed on the Board. It must consult a local authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Board think it appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the Board has had such consultations as appear to be appropriate. I recognise that this gives the Board a wide discretion. If I thought that any change would enable us to make more certain that there would be consultations with local authorities, I should be willing to make it. There is no party point about al this. We are trying to get the thing to work.

The difficulty is to specify what local authorities must be consulted and to decide who shall specify them. Reference was made to the Spey Valley drainage scheme. Clearly, certain local authorities ought to be consulted in respect of that, and, equally clearly, others should not be, but there might be some local authorities about whom there could be reservations about whether or not they were affected. Who would decide that? In the generality of the term "local authority" we include also burghs and district councils. Who is to decide which should be consulted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difficulty with which we are faced. That is why I asked the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) whether he meant a full meeting of a local authority or those affected. We think that the Board would be likely to consult people it considered would be affected, if only to make its own work easier, as would be the case if it consulted the local authorities affected. If it did not, its work could be held up in all sorts of ways. It seems to us that it would be to the advantage of the Board to consult, and that this will be done automatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to see a regular process of consultation between the Board and local authorities. We think that this will arise as the Board proceeds with different projects. It may undertake a project at Mallaig, or Sutherland, and, clearly, it would consult the local authorities in those areas. I am prepared to look at this again, but I have given some of the difficulties as we see them. What we are aiming at and why we have already dismissed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
