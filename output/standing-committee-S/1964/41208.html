	<div class='corrections'>
	<p>Errata</p>
	<p>	<i>First Sitting, Tuesday, 8th December,</i> 1964:</p>
	<p>	<i>Col.</i> 45, 	<i>line</i> 40, for "animal" read "arable".</p>
	<p>	<i>Third Sitting, Tuesday, 15th December,</i> 1964:</p>
	<p>	<i>Col.</i> 113: Mr. W. Baxter's remarks should read as follows: "Mr. W. BAXTER: This is a very interesting point. I am mindful of the fact that there are certain rivers, such as the River Carron, where the reservoir is in the catchment area. By provisional order, when the Carron reservoir was being established it was laid down that certain compensating waters were to be put back into the river. This in turn goes down the river and is used for purification purposes by certain industries. If the implication of this Bill were put into operation, one might find that certain industries would have to establish settlement tanks and take a goodly proportion of the water now going back into the river into the settlement tanks and have it diverted away, leaving the River Carron almost denuded of water, to meet the requirements under the Bill and the 1951 Act. It would mean, therefore, if the full implications of this Bill were put into operation, that people down river would be forced to alter their septic tanks. That would affect also the local authorities with their sewage purification works. They would have to be altered to meet the requirements of the very much reduced flow of water down the river. This might mean a considerable cost to many people, many industries and many local authorities, where the flow of compensation water was reduced by those industries up river taking the water from the river and diverting it by settlement tanks and through soakaways".</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Willis.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the room. I would also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments. As a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(RIVER PURIFICATION AUTHO-RITY'S CONSENT FOR CERTAIN DISCHARGES OF EFFLUENT.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 5, to leave out "it shall be unlawful" and to insert "where there is".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that along with this Amendment we discuss the Amendments in page 1, line 6, leave out "to make".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 8, leave out from "Act" to "the" in line 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 9, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may give to the person making the discharge a notice requiring him to make application to the river purification authority for their consent to such discharge.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Where such notice has been given it shall, subject to this Act, be unlawful for any person to continue to make the discharge to which the notice relates without the consent under this Act of the river purification authority which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld."</p></blockquote>
In page 2, line 1, leave out "subsection (1) of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 38, leave out "(1)" and insert "(2)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In page 3, line 17, after "but", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"notices under subsection (1) of this section and".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In Clause 2, page 3, line 26, leave out (1) and insert (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 33, leave out (5) and insert (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In page 4, line 16, leave out "the last foregoing subsection" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any notice given under section 1 (1) of this Act".</p></blockquote>
In Clause 5, page 6, line 11, leave out "(5)" and insert "(6)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start business, Mr. Steele, may I ask a question about the maps that were produced on a previous occasion, since there do not seem to be any here today? I do not know whether it is in order to ask you, or whether the right thing to do is to ask the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point for me. No doubt it has been noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is proper to point out that the Amendment in page 2, line 38, is not in my name, although I have no objection to it. During the debate on the consideration of the principle of the Bill I pointed out that, as drafted, it might cause an exceedingly large number of applications to be made to river purification authorities from a great many small discharges—in most cases quite innocuous—and that the resources of the authorities might be over-burdened by the very volume of these applications. The authorities do not have the machinery to deal with a large number of applications at one time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore suggested that the Bill would be improved if it were left to an authority to choose those discharges with which it intended to deal from time to time. It would probably start with those which it thought to be the worst, leaving the more innocuous ones to a later date, when its machinery would be capable of taking them into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Amendments are intended to make the procedure much less cumbersome and time-taking, and to ease the task of the authorities in dealing with existing discharges. The Amendments would give power to the authorities to give to persons making discharges notices requiring those persons to make application to the authorities for their consent to those discharges. In other words, an existing discharge would continue until the authority concerned decided to take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
action to deal with it. In that event the authority would give notice to the person making the discharge, whether that person was a local authority, an industrialist, a farmer or a private individual. Until notice was given, it would be lawful for the person concerned to continue to make the discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then go on to provide that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where such notice has been given it shall, subject to this Act, be unlawful for any person to continue to make the discharge to which the notice relates without the consent … of the river purification authority.…"</p></blockquote>
In other words, the authority will deal with these discharges as and when it finds it possible to do so, having regard to its machinery and organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good precedent for a procedure of this kind. In the planning Acts Parliament had this matter very much in mind in connection with the control of advertisements. There are many advertisements throughout the country, some of which are quite innocuous but some of which are obnoxious. It was appreciated that planning authorities would not be able to deal with all these advertisements at one time, so the Acts provided that advertisements could continue to be displayed until they were challenged by the planning authority, as and when the authority chose to deal with them, when they would be taken into consideration and, if necessary, modified, or even banned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is proposed in my Amendments, the planning authorities would give consent for a continuation of the display of the advertisement for a fixed period, normally five years, at the end of which time there would be no need for any further procedure unless the authority again challenged the advertisement and brought it into account. That seems to me to be an analogous case, and I therefore propose that these discharges should be allowed to carry on until they are challenged by the purification authority, and that once notice is given, the discharge becomes illegal without the consent of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other Amendments are entirely consequential upon that general thesis, and I do not propose to deal with them in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has the best of intentions. His argument that he wants to help the authorities by making sure that they are not inundated with a great deal of work is attractive at first sight, but, in fact, this series of Amendments would stand the 1951 Act on its head and make it extraordinarily difficult to operate it effectively, certainly in connection with all that has gone before in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the Clause would make it unlawful, on and after the appointed day, to continue to make an existing discharge of trade or sewage effluent
	<br><blockquote><p>"being a discharge which is not controlled under Section 28 of the principal Act, without the consent under this Act of the river purification authority"</p></blockquote>
the important point being that the onus is placed on the discharger to apply to the authority for its consent. The effect of the Amendments would be to leave it to the authority to ascertain where all the existing discharges are, and then, if it wished, to serve on the dischargers notice requiring them to make applications for consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of other matters come into operation from that. If an authority had to go out and discover all the persons making a discharge, far from it being easier for the authority it would be enormously more difficult. There would be considerable delay because, as I said in the Second Reading debate, it is difficult to trace all discharges, particularly small ones, which can be even more noxious than the large ones. Not only that, but the staff work would be considerable. Furthermore, the problem of identification would be difficult, and there would be possibility of confusion between new and old discharges. This would make the task of the authorities almost superhuman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that it might seem that by having this blanket provision whereby a discharge is an offence until it is authorised, a lot of work should be involved, but there is a sufficient time lag between the Bill becoming law and its provisions becoming fully operative to allow authorities to overcome the difficulties involved. I should point out that this is what they estimate. Therefore, by proceeding in this way we feel that we should be adopting the more sensible course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
On the other hand, to do as the hon. Member suggests would not only undermine the principle of the 1951 Act but would make the task almost impossible administratively. I am told that, scientifically, there is a strong case for arguing that no one could trace all these discharges. Certainly it would be enormously difficult to straighten out confusion between new and old discharges without standing the original Act on its head, as the hon. Member—no doubt inadvertently—is trying to do. I am sorry that I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendments, which would do considerable damage to the operation of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that there may be administrative difficulties, but it seems to me that the difficulties placed on authorities by the Clause as at present worded might be even greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid that the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. Hamilton), who has just entered, is not a member of the Committee, and I must ask him to withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put two points to the Under-Secretary. First, is he prepared to assure the Committee that where a declaration or registration of a discharge is made, consent will be more or less automatic until the authority has had time to investigate the discharge in greater detail? Secondly, will he deal with the question of a discharge in a case where the owner of land contiguous to a stream is not responsible for the discharge? Where bungalows are built near a river it often happens that they discharge their effluents through their septic tanks into field drains passing through a farmer's land. The person who is presumed to be making the discharge is the farmer, although he may have little responsibility for it. It seems to me that in such a case an intolerable burden is thrown upon that farmer, who may not even be aware that the discharge is taking place, and that a consent is required. I shall be glad if the hon. Gentleman can make any suggestions in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, the Bill later provides for a suspense period in which no offence is
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
caused because of the discharge until the matter is considered by the authority and a proper licence is issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licence is given to the discharger and not to the person owning the locus of the discharge. That is an added reason why the provisions should apply to discharges, rather than that we should have a system of contracting out from the general procedure, under which an authority is the identifier of those who are invited to contract out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman has put his finger on another argument which I did not use earlier, and it is just as well that we should get the matter clear. I am indebted to him for raising this challenge to the principle. It allows us to ventilate and consider reasons for giving the length of time and seeing the mechanism that the boards will be required to use in covering this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to say a word on the basic challenge underlying the case which has been made by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) in support of his Amendment. He whole case rested on his initial statement that the river purification boards do not have the machinery to operate the provisions in the Bill as envisaged in this Clause. If that be so, it presents a most serious challenge. Amendments based on that fact could be proposed right through the Bill. If it is so, it presents a tangible challenge not merely to this Government but to the previous Administration, and represents a tremendous accusation by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West against the Government of which he was a supporter, that after 14 years such machinery does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know, in many cases the machinery is based on the fact that the clerk to a river board is also clerk to a local authority, so it would appear that there must be some fabric of machinery in existence, and that part of it, at least, is provided by the local authority. It appears to me that if there are cases where no machinery exists, something further should be said about this by my hon. Friend, because the matter is bound to crop up again. If machinery does not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
exist, how are we to deal with this advance—as we hope it will be—in the efforts to clean up our rivers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The machinery certainly exists. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) will recollect that after his speech during the Second Reading debate he elicited from me the names of nine river boards, and there are also river purification authorities. These bodies are in being. No doubt, their effectiveness varies in accordance with their staffs, and I agree that may be a matter for individual criticism. Nevertheless, it is felt by the advisory committee, and by others, that they are able to carry out this task provided that they are not subject to strain to an impossible extent. That is what I meant when I was gently chiding the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). Although he meant to do us well by trying to cut down the large number of applications by suggesting another method of procedure, and by putting the onus of identification on the authority, it would result in a strain which would reach an impossible point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not go so far as to say that the staffs would be inadequate to the task which the Bill seeks to impose, but I think that they would prove inadequate to perform the task which the hon. Gentleman sought to impose by his suggested change in the matter of onus. I think that is the essence of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan, and I hope he will think that I have answered him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 11, after "shall", to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
When we consider paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(d)</i> immediately following, we find that fairly stringent measures are set down regarding what has to be disclosed. To me it would appear to be asking much to say that, with complete accuracy, there shall be stated such things as the maximum volume, or the highest rate, at which it is proposed to discharge effluent. In many cases that must depend on changing industrial practices. If a firm is to safeguard itself, it might have to declare the maximum amount of effluent which would ever be discharged,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
and thereby it might prejudice the chances of an acceptance by the purification authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important is the question of the result—unless there is reasonable latitude—on the possible location of industry. I wish to quote from the last Report of the Forth River Purification Board in which it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Particular industrial concerns which have investigated the possibility of establishing factory premises here are of a type which both require a fair volume of water for use in the manufacturing process and which have a corresponding volume of liquid waste for disposal. In some cases the availability of facilities for disposal may be the factor ultimately governing the choice of site".</p></blockquote>
In the next paragraph of the Report, discussing alternative ways of disposing, either into trunk sewers or sewerage plant, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first of these alternatives has drawbacks, namely that the actual volume and strength of the waste may not be known with reasonable accuracy until the factory is in operation."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it seems to me that if we are to encourage industry to locate itself in various parts of Scotland, while we must take reasonable steps where facilities are available to see that industrial waste is not discharged into open streams, we must also give reasonable latitude, and allow for the fact that people may not know to the nth degree—as is asked in the Clause—exactly what may be the volume of the waste. This is borne out by what was stated in the last Report of the Board, the 1963 Report, not perhaps the most up-to-date but the latest one available to me. I hope, therefore, that the Under-Secretary will be able to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no virtue in verbosity, and I am able to support my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) very briefly. I think it is generally agreed—the Minister of State said so himself during the Second Reading debate—that the working and the application of this legislation will depend to a considerable degree on the co-operation of those affected by the provisions. It seems to me that were we to include the words suggested by my hon. Friend, it would engender the right feeling among those whose co-operation is so necessary. I hope, therefore, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the Under-Secretary will consider this Amendment favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) and Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith). The real point is whether one can get reasonable co-operation with a lot of small people whose discharges were pre-1951, and whose activities will come within the ambit of the provisions in this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State said, perhaps rightly, that the Amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) would turn the whole thing on its head, and that his proposal was impossible because of the extra work it would give to the authorities concerned. In particular, he referred to the difficulty of finding and recognising quite small discharges which might, though small, prove to be very noxious. Inevitably, this suggests that there are a great many small people, farmers and others, who may be creating discharges—if that be the right expression—which might be against the spirit of the Bill. If that be so, I think we must also assume the corollary, that a good many of them would have considerable difficulty in stating the maximum temperature of effluent at the time of discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult, for example, to estimate the temperature of seepage from a silage pit. It is difficult for a farmer—standing on his own head, apart from what might happen to the Bill—to consider how he is to take the temperature of the effluent coming from a silage pit, or from a modern pig house, or some other form of industrial factory farming type of operation. It is extremely difficult to make a reasonable guess about the maximum discharge under varying conditions. The Minister of State, who is well acquainted with the law, may well tell us that the courts would always take into consideration what my hon. Friends are saying and what is reasonably practicable when arriving at a decision whether to prosecute, but on a good many occasions in the past the courts have said firmly that if something was what was meant, we should have said so. I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept the Amendment and regard it as helpful to the Bill rather that damaging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Opposition speakers have expressed a reasonable point of view, and reasonable words always ring a bell for hon. Members on this side of the Committee, because we are all reasonable people. To put the word "shall" in the Bill may create an obstacle and prevent some industry, large or small, from coming into a particular area. It is difficult to be precise about the temperature and amount of effluent and so on. It would be a pity by such pin-pricking—by saying, "You shall state definitely" one, two, three or four items before the river purification board permits them to establish an industry—to prevent such industry from being established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

There has been more than 10 years in which matters relating to the pollution of rivers could have been dealt with. The speeches made during the Second Reading debate, or most of them, including the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire, deplored the state of our rivers because we have been far too reasonable. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will stick to the wording of the Bill as it is drafted. The sooner we incorporate the word "shall", which will not be regarded as "may" in this case, the sooner we shall have a chance to get that open sewer called the Clyde cleaned up. How can anyone define the words "reasonably practicable"? Who can define "reasonable"? If there is any doubt about the definition in the Bill, there is even more doubt and difficulty about defining the words "reasonably practicable"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. I feel that it was possible for the hon. Gentleman to say that the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) was reasonable. How is it practicable for the hon. Gentleman to describe the one as reasonable and not the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that if the hon. Gentleman seeks to go into dialectics on the subject he will land himself in much greater difficulty than he seeks to land me. What I have said is reasonable in view of the past. It is reasonable that we should now begin to adopt a firmer attitude towards the problem of the discharge of effluent and sewage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) for putting his finger on the point. I admit that there is some attractiveness in the argument put by hon. Members opposite in favour of this Amendment, but we think that the Amendment is, first, unnecessary, and, secondly, possibly dangerous. It is unnecessary, because we feel that the river purification authorities and the Secretary of State will, in the exercise of this power, be reasonable, and will try to guide the dischargers in their declaration of details of discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, this is essentially a matter of persuasion in (the first instance. Indeed, we have been subject to much criticism, including criticism by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan, because the persuasive process has meant considerable delay in achieving clean rivers, but as there is money involved, in the agricultural industry and elsewhere, we have had to take the way of persuasion. So it follows that as part of the endeavour to get the co-operation of dischargers adequately to help in this matter, every attempt will be made to give advice and to seek to guide dischargers in sending in the necessary details to the river purification authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Acceptance of the Amendment could be dangerous because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Govan has said, what is reasonableness to one man may be a matter of unreasonableness to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
another. Therefore, despite what the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has said, if we were to put these words into the Bill we could have a very fruitful source of legal argument in the courts, and elsewhere, as to whether or not what had been done was reasonable. We think that this is something that purification authority and discharger should, in the first instance, try to settle between themselves. If an authority should find that the discharger concerned, or a series of dischargers, is being very difficult, it can seek the assistance of the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Be reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—try to give advice. After all, the authorities will be entitled to give directions, and if those directions were unreasonable the discharger could appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) for moving this Amendment, as it gives me a chance to put on record the kind of details that I think one would like to see supplied. One does not want to imagine that this is to be a completely and absolutely scientific lodgment on the part of the discharger, particularly someone who, like the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), has a septic tank. One would not like to go into all the ins and outs of the discharge—if that is the right phrase—in individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the four statements required in subsection (2) the first relates to
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the nature and composition of the effluent in respect of which the application is made."</p></blockquote>
There, it would be enough simply to record that it was domestic sewage, or it might be enough for a small farmer to say that it was domestic sewage and farm effluent for ten cows. If the authority felt that the information was not adequate it would not quarrel with the discharger but would simply ask the river inspector to make a visit, or ask the farmer for more details. It might even suggest what kind of information was wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> relates to the maximum temperature of the effluent. Generally, the idea is that it will not be above body
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
temperature. Whilst it is obvious that domestic dischargers would not have much difficulty in recording this, there may be difficulty with farmers or industrialists, although one would imagine that even a small farmer would have a thermometer, for medical if not for agricultural reasons, and would make a record if he thought the effluent was above body temperature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> relates to maximum volume. In relation to the type of activity being conducted I do not think that it would be difficult to make a guess at this, but if that was inadequate from the authority's point of view, the person could ask the authority to be kind enough to help in assessing the maximum volume.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last paragraph—	<i>(d)</i>—is concerned with the highest rate of discharge. In relation to the home, it could be recorded that Monday was washday and there was a high discharge. I do not think that all this would be necessary, but I am trying to help the Committee in describing how the application form could be filled in. The owner of a dairy farm could give the nature of the farm, details of the dairy washings, and various sequences of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is all very reasonable, but if we were to put this in the form suggested in the Amendment we would only make things difficult, or provide a possible source of legal argument which could lead to litigation. We therefore think that such wording might be undesirable. The advice given to the Government is that this would be a dangerous Amendment to accept, although we agree that its purpose is quite sound. Nevertheless, the farming community has the advice of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and we have already been in communication about this. The Department will give every assistance it can to make known throughout the farming community—and throughout industry in relation to other parts of the Scottish Office—that this information is being asked for, and every effort will be made to demonstrate what is needed in order to conform with this requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had experience in relation to new dischargers, and there has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
no complaint at all from any persons about the unnecessarily difficult way in which the river purification boards are handling applications for consent. I therefore do not envisage that there will be any difficulty at all. Whilst I can appreciate the point of tabling the Amendment, I think it reasonable to say that, since we shall take all necessary steps to make sure that every section of the community is aware of the requirement and that advice is given where necessary, there is no need to incorporate it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State has strengthened our argument for including these words. He has more or less invited applicants not to stick too rigidly to the terms of the four paragraphs of subsection (2), and to ignore the direction implied in the word "shall". If we are inviting people to do that, it is more reasonable to use the words suggested in our Amendment. To most people, the use of the word "shall" means a rigid adherence, and I welcome the fact that the hon. Gentleman has said that it is not necessary to be too rigid about this. Nevertheless, I think the words we suggest would enable the hon. Gentleman to do more easily exactly what he wants to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) moved his Amendment in most reasonable terms, but my fear, and the fear generally expressed on Second Reading, is that we would not be able to control the volume of effluents being poured into our rivers and estuaries. In this Committee we find some of those who were in sympathy with the intention of the Bill now trying to incorporate words that would make it much more difficult for the people employed by the river authorities, and others interested in clean rivers and clean coastlines, to carry out the responsibilities we put on them. It will still be difficult under the Bill as drafted to obtain our objective of cleaner rivers, shores and estuaries and, at the same time, to satisfy all the various interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are interested in this subject may well be alarmed by the Report of the Nature Conservancy, dated 30th November. The Report has been highlighted in certain newspapers, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
it proves conclusively that much damage is being done. In page 47, under the heading:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Environmental Contamination—	<i>Pesticides and Wild Life: Review of Persistent Pesticides"</i> we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The most notable event in this field during the year was the result of the review of the risks arising from the use of the persistent organochlorine pesticides undertaken by the Advisory Committee on Poisonous Substances used in Agriculture and Food Storage at the request of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (see Annual Rpt, 1963, p. 46)."</p></blockquote>
The first point in the evidence submitted is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Contamination by organic insecticides is widespread and is not confined to the areas sprayed. In particular fresh water and marine habitats are affected.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Birds which feed on vertebrate prey contain higher residues than do insectivores, omnivores and herbivores. Similarly the eggs of predatory birds contain larger quantities of insecticides than do the eggs of other species."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider that I am perfectly in order, Mr. Steele, because we are asking for a more reasonable approach in regard to the word "shall", and I say that we now have the Nature Conservancy Report showing the pollution in our rivers and coastal waters resulting from the greater use of insecticides and chemicals. I want to know whether the Bil is strong enough.

On page 48 of the Report, we are told that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a result of the review, the committee recommended that:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>1. The use of aldrin and dieldrin in fertiliser mixtures and in sheep dips and sprays"—</p></blockquote>
this should interest the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) with his vast herds of sheep roaming the hills and his own sales; he uses sprays, but he will have a more expensive future because they will be banned—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should cease as soon as could be arranged."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with applications for consents. Perhaps the hon. Member will relate his argument to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My submission, Mr. Steele, is that by the Amendment the consent would be much easier to obtain. I am asking for the retention of "shall" to control what the Nature Conservancy Report has highlighted. The Nature Conservancy Report suggests that certain things should be banned as soon as possible. I want to know from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State whether his existing powers permit the banning of these things which are proved to contaminate our coastal waters, which affect the marine habitats and which are doing great damage to the flora and fauna in our rivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I detected dubiety in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary about keeping the Bill as it is. He went so far as to say that a fair amount of advice would be available to people and that in certain circumstances a guess could be made. When, however, an Act of Parliament stipulates that details concerning maxima and other things shall be given precisely, a guess is not a very happy state of affairs to resort to in making one's return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I counsel my hon. Friend to remember that many of our farms and small industries have been placed in positions near river banks, not recently, but many years ago. There are physical difficulties even in providing a septic tank or the like that would be as suitable as one would desire. I do not think, however, that that adds greatly to the problem of river purification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding what my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) has just said about insecticides and fertilisers, we do not know exactly what damage they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We must be reasonable in the difficult circumstances that prevail in Scotland. I counsel my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to look at this matter again, not to be too emphatic or dogmatic this morning, but to give a little more consideration to the problem which has been placed before him. Surely, there is no urgency in this matter. Physical difficulties arise in matters such as these when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
it is specified that this, that or the next thing shall be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had the advantage of hearing the earlier discussion on the Amendment, but, after consideration, it seems to me to be an Amendment which would improve the legislation. A distinction has to be drawn between obligations imposed upon the subject and obligations imposed upon the Minister. Some of my hon. Friends have views about the absence of the word "reasonable" from the duties imposed upon the Minister. One has to assume that in exercising his statutory discretion the Minister will do so reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, however, is an entirely different matter. Before an application comes to be considered by the Minister, there is a precise provision that certain requirements will be met. As it stands, the Bill means that before an application can be considered, an applicant must submit in detail the information referred to in subsection (2). If it is impossible or exceedingly difficult to be precise in these matters, it seems to me that the mandatory provision should be qualified in the way suggested by our Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that this provision exists in the English Act of 1961, but hon. Members opposite would, I am sure, be the first to agree that that is no reason for following the English terminology. In my view, the Amendment should be accepted. It would not prejudice the operation of the Bill, and it would make the matter much more simple and practical from the viewpoint of the individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hardly claim that I shall cross swords with the hon. Member in that way. The application in question is one for exemption as provided for in subsection (1), and it is only right to say that those who seek exemption must justify it by stating the underlying reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Earl the Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) rather congratulated my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on having shown how reasonable he was in his definition of the meaning of paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(b)</i> of subsection (2). When the noble Earl seized
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
upon that as justification for the Amendment, I thought that his speech was justification for the Bill as it stands by showing how reasonable the Government's argument had been. I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) will not support the Amendment, because his speech was one of the most revolutionary I have ever heard from the benches opposite about the spirit of the Bill. I cannot think that if there is a Division, the hon. Member will support the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying question is how best to seek the co-operation of the people who will be affected. Hon. Members opposite are, I suggest, seeking to bend over backwards to achieve that purpose. We all appreciate what this may mean in cost, in work and the rest, but many of the applications for exemption will not have to cover all the items listed in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(d).</i> Some will apply to only some of these items.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member suggests that some of these provisions will not apply.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not thinking only in terms of farms. There will be varied projects along river banks, for example, to which the requests to state the maximum temperature or maximum volume of an effluent may not apply.

The Under-Secretary of State has not answered a particular point which I

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
raised. What happens concerning a new industry? An industrialist cannot site his factory until he knows what can be done with the effluent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not apply in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted the example of the Forth River Purification Board, which said that until a factory commenced operation nobody could reasonably say what the type of effluent would be. Consequently, the person in question is being asked in advance to state things which he is not in a position to state. This would react to the detriment of establishing industry in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not seek to lower the standard which a river purification board accepts. We are only asking for reasonable latitude for somebody who makes application concerning the sort of particulars that he must give. The Amendment would not mean that he did not have to state the nature and composition of an effluent when these things already existed and were known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless there is adequate provision to the contrary, the kind of insecticides and chemicals to which I have referred from the Nature Conservancy Report will still be used. Without the word "shall", there will be evasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point at issue. The Clause asks people to state, when making application, what the effluent is. If they know what it is, they will state it. The Amendment would make no difference in that respect; people would still state it if they knew the nature of the effluent. It is when one comes down to such details as maximum volume, temperature and the like that doubts may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have quoted from the Report of the Forth River Purification Board which states that it is impossible to say until something starts to operate exactly what it is. We do not suggest any lowering of standards. We are asking only that the boards should be reasonable in the way that the information is to be presented to them. It is still open to a board to refuse to give consent. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Amendment has nothing to do with what standard a river board sets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) has spoken about industrialists not knowing the maximum temperature or volume of effluent. I dispute that. I cannot understand any industrialist or engineer who knows his job putting down a plant to produce a product and using water as coolant and not knowing how much water will pass through the plant for cooling purposes and the temperature at which it will leave the plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that until one knows what type of industry is to go into a factory, one cannot give these details, but when an industrialist designs his production techniques he knows how much water he will need as coolant and, therefore, how much water will pass out as effluent from the plant. He knows the size of his manpower and the volume of his effluent. He knows the capacity of the plant to employ a given number of people. If the factory is expanded, there will be more, of course. The hon. Gentleman's argument was an absurdity and a gross exaggeration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not quoting my own authority when I said that. I was quoting the authority of the River Forth Purification Board. I quoted what the Board said. It was not my opinion. It was what responsible people who at the moment administer the purification of the River Forth say. They say that until the plant is operating they cannot tell what the nature of the effluent will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Noble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Steele, I had not concluded my argument. I gave way to an interruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member had finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That may be a general proposition in the Report of the River Forth Purification Board, but any industrialist or engineer taking over a plant will calculate the amount of water required, whether from a canal or from the River Forth. He will know what is required. In so far as he uses it and it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
passes through his cooling equipment and he has to pass it back into the river, he will know what it is, within reasonable limits. He will know its maximum temperature. The important point is the maximum temperature of the effluent at the time of discharge. Every engineer knows the maximum temperature his coolant will reach. He can state that maximum temperature. He knows full well that it will never enter any river at that maximum temperature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to keep the Committee any great amount of time longer on the Amendment, but I must point out that the Committee has been straying a certain amount from what is clearly the point and effect of the Amendment. Hon. Members on both sides—not the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), who I think appreciated the point—have argued that the Amendment would weaken the effect of the Bill by allowing people, where reasonably practicable, to discharge extra effluent into rivers. This is not the point of the Amendment. It is purely a question of obtaining the consent. Whether the consent is granted is up to the authority. All that is important—I hope that the Under-Secretary will think about this—is that when the person, whether he is a farmer, a big industrialist, a small industrialist or anybody else, is making his application for consent, perhaps temporarily, he should not be bound by the completely firm words that his "application … shall state".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from many aspects of our own life that when filling up forms for various purposes we do the best we can to give the correct answers. If we make deliberately wrong answers, we are subject to all the penalties and rigours to which the action we take lays us open. Under the Bill, anyone who fails to state the maximum temperature of the effluent, for instance, is liable to considerable penalties. The Amendment would have no effect on the powers of the authorities. It would merely give, where reasonably practicable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does indeed say that. The hon. Gentleman should study the Amendment and the Bill. The Amendment would make it possible for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
farmer or industrialist, or whoever it may be, to do the best he could and get advice from the authority's officials. They may not be able to give him the exact answer, but these words would then cover him from being prosecuted later for not stating precisely the four things required in paragraphs 	<i>(a), (b), (c)</i> and 	<i>(d).</i> If the Clause is passed in its present form, he will be bound to state all those things. Therefore, the Government should accept that the Amendment has nothing whatever to do with any effort to relax the strict conditions under which discharges are made into rivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole point. Unless the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) sees that, he will persist with his hon. Friends in believing this to be true. He will do a great deal of damage to the Bill. The question the Committee must ask itself is this: Who in the last analysis decides what is reasonable? If we write into the Bill a provision to the effect that the discharger states certain matters
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
the discharger could in court argue—he might even be accompanied by some hon. Members opposite—that he filled in the particulars required in his application
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
Therefore he would not be liable to the fines provided for by the Bill for disobeying a direction, even though the charge against him is that he continued to make the discharge. The argument against the Amendment is that it provides a basis for legal confusion, certainly for litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried earlier on to convince the Committee that, despite the very strict words in the Bill, it is not the intention that there should be an absurd bureaucratic and unduly demanding system of inquiry. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is written in."] Of course it is, but it is perfectly reasonable that in making an application to the authority in respect of a septic tank, for example, one would not necessarily have to go into absolutely every detail. For example, it would be absurd if one were required to state the chemical nature of the bodily discharge which was going through the septic tank. After all, people's bodily wastes differ. It depends what their intake is. They may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
absorbing water instead of alcohol. They may be absorbing foods of different kinds. It would clearly be absurd to require the faecal nature of domestic discharges to be stated precisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, since the Bill is to apply to industrial plant as well as to a domestic tank, words like these must obviously be used. The Clause is designed to cover industry, agriculture and domestic matters. Therefore, it must be drawn in these extraordinarily formal words, which would imply an almost unreasonable demand on a very simple farmer with ten cows or on a lady doing her washing on Mondays or on a person with a septic tank. The reasonableness of the demands on the discharges must be married with the words in the Bill because, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, there are heavy penalties for infringements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said to the Committee has been said on the basis of all the information that the Scottish Office can provide. I am sorry that in his short period in opposition, which will be considerably longer, the right hon. Gentleman has changed his mind, because this is a Bill which we have to some extent, including this point, inherited from him. It is strange that we should hear this argument from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point—my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) made this point very well, when he described the enormous advances which have taken place in farming methods, which demand an understanding by river purification boards if they are to help farmers—is to stress that we are most earnestly trying to get the reasonable co-operation of everyone. We want everyone concerned to understand what is involved. If hon. Members opposite persist with the Amendment, they will, inadvertently perhaps, but nevertheless effectively, either lower the effectiveness of the Bill and the standards that the boards seek to impose progressively over a period, or involve those concerned in litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither course is desirable. This morning I have tried earnestly to show that it is the intention of those concerned with the Bill to administer the Bill in as reasonable a form as they can. If hon. Members opposite are convinced that in the last analysis the Secretary of State,
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
whoever he may be, will be totally unreasonable, they might seek to write these words into the Bill. They will by doing so damage the whole Bill. I strongly counsel the Committee not to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier this morning the Under-Secretary talked about a small farm. He went through paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(d),</i> giving what I can only describe as very vague information. At one point he mentioned a guess. That is a reasonable way of describing what someone who has not all the facilities of making the measurements required will have to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been stated in the Committee, but it is not stated in the Bill. A farmer who made the best estimate he could of temperature or any other matter referred to in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(d)</i> might find himself exposed to penalties. He would have done what the Under-Secretary suggested, but he might, with the best of good faith, have got it wrong. If a check were made later, it might be found that he was wrong. Even though what the Under-Secretary described in his interpretation was reasonable, we believe that this should be written into the Bill so that it is clear to such a farmer that he need not be anxious that, having sent in his application form, he might have been wrong on some point and rendered himself liable to penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an applicant in his application to a river purification authority writes in the kind of guess I suggested earlier and the authority says, "This is absurd. We do not want any of your guesses. We do not want any of your vague ideas", the authority will go on to say, "This is what we want", and will ask precise questions. The authority's inspector may help by saying, "This is what we want to find out". The authority may even help the farmer to determine the maximum outflow or the maximum temperature. If the discharger says, "I do not want your assistance. I am content simply to record what in my opinion is reasonably sensible", the river purification authority will issue a direction under the original Act saying, "You will tell us the following things about your application before we can consent to it."
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
If the person concerned thinks that the authority is being outrageous in making such demands on him, he will appeal to the Secretary of State. In the last analysis, the Secretary of State will have to decide whether the direction issued by the authority is sensible and reasonable in the light of the information required in the locality in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could be more reasonable than that. Hon. Members opposite will damage the Bill if they persist with the Amendment, because instead of having the Secretary of State as the final arbiter they will have the courts and the lawyers, with their plural decisions. It would be better if we made this a nice clean Bill and made the obligations of dischargers clear so that they are able to carry out the decisions of the Secretary of State, who is the custodian of the public good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was invited earlier by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) to state my point of view. The hon. Gentleman stated that what I said on Second Reading was very radical. I cannot help feeling that we are having a bit of a storm in a teacup.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary to help my hon. Friends and myself. If the Under-Secretary persists in his attitude, it rather looks as if there will be a Division. I should have thought that at this early stage of the Bill we wanted to avoid a Division. We wish to be reasonable. The Under-Secretary for his part wishes to be reasonable. I doubt very much whether it will make a great difference from a practical point of view whether these words are inserted or left out. Therefore, as it is a form of words which will make the Bill appear to be more reasonable and sensible to ordinary people, I urge the Government to accept the Amendment. Otherwise, if at the very start they are going to behave in an unreasonable fashion we shall not make as good progress as we might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member said that the Secretary of State would decide whether or
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
not it was reasonable. I do not know whether he is the right person to decide whether people have behaved in a reasonable manner. I would have thought that the people who should decide such a matter would be precisely those in the courts. That is what they are there for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Secretary of State does not receive the best legal advice from his Department in these matters, or that the calibre of legal advice that he gets is of a lower character than he could get from someone else, possibly on the other side of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I am certain that the Secretary of State, even though there is not a Law Officer in the Committee—and I understand the difficulty in which hon. Members opposite are placed in this connection—receives the best legal advice. But justice not only has to be done; it has to be seen to be done, and I cannot help feeling that a person who thought that he had behaved reasonably in satisfying the information required and was then told by the Secretary of State, on appeal, that he had not behaved reasonably, would be aggrieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This seems to me to be the sort of interpretation for which the courts are admirably suited, and I urge the Government to think about this matter again. It is a small concession. It will not make any difference to the practical effect of the Bill, but it will create a good impression, and it will be understood that we are proceeding in a reasonable and practical manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He referred to the difficulty of deciding what is reasonableness, and spoke about appeals to the courts. I have studied the Acts on the subject of pollution fairly fully, and in my opinion there is something in what he says, namely, that it may not be possible to appeal to the Secretary of State against the reasonableness of an application,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 3, to leave out "think fit" and to insert "reasonably impose".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although this Amendment appears to be rather similar to the last one, it is in fact very different, and I hope that the hon. Member will be very reasonable in dealing with it. I believe that industrial interests are generally in favour of the Bill. I am sure that the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) will agree that the paper industry is very much in favour of cleaning up pollution. But there is a point at which further purification of effluent ceases to be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sought a definition from the Under-Secretary as to what he considered reasonable, but he did not give much of an answer. Industry, and the paper industry in particular, is extremely worried about the deletion of the word "reasonable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, it would probably be for the convenience of the Committee to consider with this Amendment the Amendment in Schedule 2, page 14, line 14, leave out from beginning to end of line 18, and the Amendment in page 14, line 20, leave out from beginning to end of line 24, which are very much tied up with this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
possible an appeal to the Secretary of State as to the reasonableness of an application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That those words be there inserted:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14; Noes, 17.</p>
	<p>intended to delete certain proposed Amendments to the 1951 Act which provide that consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Under the 1951 Act we have been working with those words as part of the law, and as far as I know they have not created any difficulty. Many industrialists and local authorities are perturbed by the proposal to delete these words and to provide no similar ones. In the corresponding English Bill—the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961—those words are included, and it seems only right that in a matter of this sort, which affects industrialists—and we are trying to persuade them to come to Scotland from the south—a uniform code should apply both to Scotland and to England and Wales, as far as possible.</p>
	<p>An industrialist who proposes to come to Scotland will be very concerned if he discovers that, whereas in England consent will not be unreasonably withheld, we in Scotland have gone to considerable trouble to delete those words from the corresponding Scottish legislation.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, industrialists and local authorities have found that members of river pollution authorities are apt to be very biased, and that they do not quite understand all the difficulties involved. For instance, fishing interests are apt to regard the cleanliness of water from the fishing point of view as of paramount importance. Very often they do not appreciate the difficulties that beset in-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
dustrialists and local authorities in purifying effluents beyond a certain point. I suggest that in this case reasonableness should be bound up with the question whether the effluent is poisonous or unnecessarily noxious.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about the angling interests, I suggest that we have been far too reasonable so far. We now have a number of rivers in which fish cannot live and where no stocking can take place because of the amount of effluent that is poured in. Far from there having been any unreasonableness, I suggest that we have been too reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so in certain circumstances, but there are rivers in respect of which industrialists are going to a great deal of trouble over effluents, and where no damage is being done to fish. In my constituency a landowner who is a member of the river purification authority recently told a large industrialist, who was doing his best to purify his effluent, that he would have his works closed, if necessary, to produce what he, the landowner, considered a proper degree of purification, in spite of the fact that his fishing was not suffering to any extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a case of this sort we have to weigh up all the considerations. Undoubtedly the landowner was worried about his salmon fishing, but the industrialist, who was doing his best to purify his effluent, was providing a livelihood for no fewer than 6,000 persons, and to compare him with the other man is not practicable, unless we have a reasonable criterion which can be applied in cases of this sort. I have suggested that reasonableness should apply in cases where the effluent is not poisonous or unduly noxious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales this provision seems to have worked very satisfactorily, and it has worked very satisfactorily in Scotland up to now. I suggest that we shall be doing Scotland a disservice if we deliberately omit these words from our legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has explained clearly the reasons behind his Amendment. I simply want to add that although the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Bill has been published only for a short time—and that is nobody's fault; it is the result of the historic date of the Election and the beginning of the new Parliament—some anxiety has been caused to industrialists in Scotland about the proposed change of wording from the equivalent English Bill. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to assure us that the omission of these words does not mean that the situation will be so different as positively to deter industrialists in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to obtain some clarification about how this would apply to the paper industry. There is a paper mill in my constituency, in the town of Denny, which would find it practically impossible to obtain an absolutely clear discharge. The only way to do it would be to put into operation a system advocated at the last sitting of the Committee by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) of drawing a line from the mills to a point three miles out to sea. If the local authority or the purification board thought fit that this should take place, would it become mandatory on the paper industry to make provision regarding sewage right down to the sea? If so, it would put the industry in Denny out of business. I should like an assurance that there will be some safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: would there be some form of consultation between the purification board and the several industries which might be sited on the banks of a river? Is that what is meant by "think fit"? I have two paper mills in my constituency, and I hope that there will be some manner of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to appreciate this difference. All Scottish Bills tend—despite what was said earlier—to be better than the English legislation. We have tried hard to make this Bill better than its English counterpart. That is the one argument in favour of bringing in English Bills first and Scottish Bills second. We believe it is better to use the words "think fit" than "reasonably impose". For that reason we have deleted "unreasonably withheld" in relation to the provisions from Sections 22, 24 and 28 of the 1951 Act which we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
incorporated into Schedules 2 and 4 of this Bill. This represents quite a deliberate attempt by the Government to substitute words in this Bill for words used in legislation as late as the Spray Irrigation (Scotland) Act.

If hon. Members will reflect, they will appreciate that there is a difference between deciding what is to be thought fit and what, in fact, is being reasonable. If one contemplates the position of the Secretary of State, which I sought to defend in relation to the operation of this Bill when we discussed an earlier Amendment, one finds that he is given better powers of arbitration, for exactly the reasons mentioned, by being able to decide what is thought fit as distinct from being reasonable. There is a margin of difference between the decision on either basis which we think is in favour of those concerned by the use of the words "think fit". This is a different phrase from that in the English legislation, but we suggest that that is an argument in favour, although not a very strong one. We also believe that we are consistent in deleting the phrase earlier, and our final argument is that we leave the appellant the widest possible grounds of appeal to defend his position within the framework of the phrase "think fit" as distinct from "reasonably impose".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does "think fit" impose a harder condition than "reasonable"? Which imposes the firmest condition upon the polluter—if I may put it in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very unfair question. It is as bad as asking, "Have you stopped beating your wife lately?" I am told that the Amendment to insert the words "reasonably impose" does not improve on the words in the Clause, and the reference to "reasonable" is regarded as restricting the powers of authority to impose conditions, especially the powers of the Secretary of State on appeal in deciding whether conditions are fit, not whether they are reasonable. In other words, the answer is "Yes" and "No". Sometimes it would favour the board and at other times the appellant, depending on the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that once again the Government are trying to show how reasonable they are, and how progressive they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
in going in advance of the English legislation. I ask the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) not to press this Amendment but to accept the view of the Government and leave the words as they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it absolutely impossible to follow that argument. In Section 7(10) the 1951 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any question whether the consent of a river board has or has not been reasonably withheld or as to the reasonableness of any conditions or of any variation of any conditions shall be determined …"</p></blockquote>
by the Secretary of State. Then in subsection (11,	<i>c</i>) it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the application was in respect of the reasonableness of any variation of a condition, he may direct either that the condition shall be treated as continuing in force unvaried"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or that it shall be varied in such manner as appears to him to be reasonable …"</p></blockquote>
That appears to me to deal with the case absolutely, and the provision in this Bill does not seem to improve on the situation at all. It says simply that the river pollution authority may do what it thinks fit. It does not take away the right of appeal to the Secretary of State. It does take away the rule laid down in the 1951 Act that the Secretary of State is to deal with the matter. I cannot see how this Bill will improve the situation. Its provisions are worse than those in the 1951 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly we are making too much of this. I am sure that the words "may think fit" will be interpreted very reasonably and that the Secretary of State will wish to do all he can in order not to arrive at a decision which would in any way curb, for example, industrial expansion. I am trying to be reasonable but I am anxious that the provisions in the Bill shall be as strong as possible.

The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) touched on one point with which we are concerned when he referred to a river, which he indicated was a salmon river, and said that a landowner was able to impose conditions which were far beyond what some people might think fit. The hon. Member was speaking of a salmon river, where it would cost perhaps £12 a week for people to fish, or several hundreds of pounds to rent a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
month's fishing. If the river purification boards are to deal with this question as they may think fit, would they create any distinction between different rivers; or will my hon. Friend ensure that rivers which do not contain salmon would be considered on the same basis as a salmon river from which landowning interests might derive much revenue? I am concerned that in respect of a river stocked with the kind of fish for which working-men may fish the same facilities will be available as may be provided for the benefit of landowning interests which control stretches of the Dee or the Don.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary will make a concession in this respect, because it is very important that industrialists should not gain the impression that this Bill is designed to operate against industrial interests and that too much attention is being paid by the Department to the need for purity of water and the protection of fishing interests. The industry concerned will be the heavy industries which are less profitable in Scotland at the present time. In the Annual Report of the Clyde River Purification Board there is a reference to industries and particular firms affected by decisions made by the Board. These include bleachers, dyers, leather workers, tanneries and the like. They are the least able to bear the expense of taking additional measures which may become necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland depends on these industries more than does England, and there may be justification for making the provisions in Scottish legislation less stringent. We go further in this Clause than does the legislation affecting England, and this may create the wrong impression for industry. In Clause 9(2) we remove any defence which may be open to industry that it has no option but to put effluent into some watercourse or river. I think it important that in respect of this or a future Amendment the Under-Secretary should make a concession, so that the impression may be given to industry that the Government sympathise with the practical problems confronting industrialists. If not, there may arise a real danger of industry feeling that its interests are not being protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I can understand that they may do so, I do not think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
there is any real reason for industrialists to worry. In the last resort there is a facility under Clause 6(2) for an appeal to the Secretary of State. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an appeal is made as aforesaid, the Secretary of State may allow or dismiss the appeal, or may vary or revoke any terms of any such consent or notice …"</p></blockquote>
We could not have any statutory remit to the descretion of the Secretary of State in other terms than this. Those are the kind of terms one sees in all legislation in which there is a remit of this kind to the Secretary of State. It will be found in the planning legislation. It is implied that the Secretary of State has an obligation to act reasonably. I do not feel that by writing into the Clause that the Secretary of State will act reasonably we shall make any real difference to the function of this legislation. I am open to persuasion by my hon. Friends, but if there is a real feeling that because of the wording of the Clause it would be better if it were worded differently, so that it would be better understood, I cannot see any reason why it should not be altered—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have a situation which it is hard to understand. We know the background of this Bill. It was not prepared by us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not think that the incorporation of the Amendment would be of the slightest interest in relation to the provisions in the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not aware of any evidence that any industrialists are worried. If there is evidence to the contrary, we should like to hear it, but we are not aware of any great concern in industry over this point. Here there is a balance of interests which I tried to describe earlier. We think that industry would welcome a position in which the Secretary of State would not be tied to considering whether the purification authority had imposed conditions which were unreasonable but would consider whether he thought the whole thing was fit in relation to action which had been wisely taken. The Secretary of State may consider the whole matter afresh and decide what conditions should or should not be imposed, and this is in relation to a very wide appeal. It might be criticised from another point of view entirely. Here again is an example of an attempt to strike a balance and to improve the past position. I hope that the Amendment will not be pressed, but if it is, I must advise my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite to keep the wording as it appears in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due deference to what my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has said about the legalistic side, I assure the Under-Secretary that industry is very worried. Certain of us have had representations from the Federation of British Industries, which is concerned with industry throughout the United Kingdom. It has expressed concern that the law in Scotland is to appear, at any rate, to be more rigid than the English law, and has expressed doubts as to the effect of that on attracting industry to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to particular industries, I have already mentioned a paper mill in my constituency which has a clear effluent which does no harm to fish or anything else, but where it would cost £140,000 to make the effluent clearer. Since then, I have had representations from another firm which tells me that to produce an effluent clearer than the present one—again, it is non-toxic—would cost £247,000. However looked at, those are very big figures, and if additional burdens of cost are to be put on industries in Scotland, or appear to
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
be put on them, other industries will certainly not be attracted there. I ask the Under-Secretary of State to consider the Amendment again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 12, after "such" to insert "consent or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is mainly a drafting Amendment, but it has substance. The subsection gives the Secretary of State powers to impose conditions and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… any such conditions may be framed so as to have effect for a specified period, or for a period beginning or ending with a specified date."</p></blockquote>
The Bill is ineffective in that it does not give a river purification authority power to make the consent itself have effect for a specified period or for a period beginning or ending with a specified date. It is very desirable that an authority should have such power because, in the course of time, conditions may so change that it might wish to withdraw a consent. I suggest that acceptance of the Amendment would improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing grieves me more than not to be in a position to accept this Amendment. I am desperately anxious to find an Amendment that I can accept. This one would, if accepted, allow an authority to grant a consent for a specified period only, but our hope is that the system will tend to help the discharger as well as reduce the amount of work of the authorities. Once a consent is issued—as, indeed, is reflected in the Amendment in page 2, line 14, which follows this one—we should like it to continue until such time as it is necessary to review it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the consent is dependent on a specified time it means that it must automatically come up for review. It is obviously in the discharger's interests—he does not want to be bothered in that way—that the consent should be reviewed no more often than is necessary. To introduce this provision would, I think, bring in an undesirable element. I am sorry not to be able to concede this point to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two Amendments taken together are, in a sense, acceptable, but they are unnecessary because this point is already covered in the Bill. As far as the Amendments together relate to conditions they would be inconsistent with Clause 5, because Clause 5 provides for conditions running on in a normal case for a period of not less than two years. An indefinite period could be less than two years, and such an expression would confuse the whole system. Therefore, while the intention of the two Amendments taken together is very commendable, it is unnecessary, and would tend to confuse the later position under Clause 5.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was apologising for not being able to put down this Amendment earlier, but hon. Members on both sides will have had the subject matter in their post over the weekend, in a document which the Scottish National Farmers' Union says it sent to every Scottish Member of Parliament. I did not receive my copy until yesterday, and other hon. Members may have been in the same position. I put down the Amendment as soon as I could, realising that at such short notice it would have to take its chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand the position of the Scottish National Farmers' Union. It wanted to consult its branches about the Bill. As I have already said, I recognise that with the new Parliament and the historical fact of the date of the General Election the Bill could not be published sooner than it was. Therefore, no one can be blamed for this short notice. Nevertheless, the Scottish N.F.U. has had difficulty in crystallising views and circulating them to Members representing Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment emphasises the difficulties for certain farmers who for reasons of geology and geography, may find themselves with effluents resulting from traditional methods of farming which they cannot immediately dispose of differently or purify at once as required by the Bill. I am glad to see, however, that the organisation does not foresee any great quantities of harmful effluents from farms, but only modest quantities. The Amendment therefore
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
applies to farmers who might find themselves in difficulties because of special conditions of the kind I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is mainly one of time, and there is another Amendment that will also raise that point. The Amendment includes the words "is not reasonably practicable", which is the sort of phrase we considered earlier. I realise that it may have difficulties for the Government, but I would say to the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) that the position here is not the same as with an Amendment we discussed earlier, because in this case the phrase applies to withholding consent and the procedure of considering applications, while in the other case it was a question of whether the statements of information that had to be provided by applicants should go forward in a certain form containing the word "reasonable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can be assured that the Government will very carefully consider the position of farmers who may find themselves in difficulties. I am glad to have the general statement of the Scottish National Farmers' Union that it does not think that farming as a whole will face any great effluent difficulty. The English N.F.U. commented at the time on the 1961 English Bill and, after that, welcomed the Measure, as the Scottish N.F.U. has in general. I understand that the farming community is not against the principles of the Bill, but in favour of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish N.F.U. is also glad that after the passage of this Bill farmers will be assisted with technical and procedural advice. I have here a booklet produced by the English National Farmers' Union in 1963, after the 1961 English Measure had been passed. I understand that it has been very helpful to the fanners, and I presume that the Government would assist the Scottish National Farmers' Union to produce a similar booklet, or publish advice in convenient form for Scottish farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very much for the convenience of the Committee, Mr. Steele, that we should consider this Amendment now. Although we discussed the subject on Second Reading I am very glad that you have selected this starred Amendment. It does not cause the Government any embarrassment at all, as this
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
is clearly a matter of considerable interest. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made this subject the basis of a speech on Second Reading—and a very good speech it was, if I may say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment raises the essential point of whether or not we can exempt certain sectors of the economy from the application of the Bill. The answer, quite clearly, is that we cannot, because if we were to exempt agriculture we would immediately have to allow cases to be heard in relation if not to industry in general at least to industry in particular. I can see a glint in the eye of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) when I say that, because the paper industry would clearly want to be considered in the same light. Therefore, it would be more than a hole in the dyke if we were to concede this. It would be the end of any solid and sincere attempt to purify rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot share the view of the hon. Member' that the chemicals used in farming are, somehow, not noxious or may not become as noxious as those used in industry. It is difficult to say. In the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) read from the Nature Conservancy Report, I should not like to commit myself one way or the other. I do not, however, regard that as an argument. Even if it were true that these things used in farming were the most innocent, it would still be wrong in principle to exempt any part of the community from the application of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that the Government are in any way antipathetic or neutral concerning the difficulties of the agriculture industry. Although I do not want to commit the Government to any specific courses of action, we shall certainly help the National Farmers' Union and any other organisation which is anxious to help farmers who want to comply reasonably and without difficulty with the provisions of the Bill. Whether this will be done by means of a booklet, I should not like to say. I merely repeat my Second Reading assurance that the Department of Agriculture will do everything possible to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
give the widest possible publicity and help to the agriculture industry to meet its obligations under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the more concrete help of which the hon. Member spoke on Second Reading, I said on that occasion that grants of one-half the cost were available for organic spray irrigation schemes which are also water irrigation schemes, and farm improvement grants of one-third of the cost are available for installing farm sewage systems. There are various other provisos, and, of course, the Government keep these matters very much in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to anticipate future arrangements which may be made, but I think that the Exchequer is very considerate towards farmers in relation to their general difficulties as well as to these particular difficulties. The Government do not see any pressing reason for improving any of the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes), who has just come in, is not a member of the Committee and I must ask him to withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will struggle along without one of my other allies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not see any pressing reason for revising any of those grants. It should be said, nevertheless, that it would profit many farmers if they were to study the question of trying to return the farm effluent as a fertiliser. This might be a profitable way of disposing of their wastes. On Second Reading, I gave the illustration that it had been done in industry. Large-scale farmers are thinking of this. It surely is not beyond the wit of the National Farmers' Union to consider alternative schemes to help farmers to try to return their effluent as fertiliser to the soil rather than as pollution to the river. I am sorry that I cannot accede to the Amendment, but I hope that the Committee fully appreciates the reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary of State for the assurances which he has given. I certainly am not unaware of the grants which are available to farmers to meet the kind of situation which they have to face. I appreciate very much the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Gentleman's statement that the Department of Agriculture will look favourably upon applications from the farming industry so that farmers may meet what is being put upon them as a result of the Bill. I also appreciate the work that is being done in Scotland by the colleges, particularly the East of Scotland College of Agriculture, on the disposal of farm effluent and the return of effluents to the soil. A tremendous amount of work is being done in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that hon. Members opposite fully appreciate the position of farmers in getting grants for works of this nature. We in the agriculture industry do not have the benefits that other sections of industry have. For example, quite apart from anything else, most other sections of industry have the benefit of a 15 per cent. tariff protection, which agriculture does not have. Therefore, we are in a particular position in asking for special treatment in the interpretation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain the problems which face agriculture and why we have put forward the Amendment. First, however, I should like to make a small point concerning chemicals, herbicides, pesticides and effluents. In case the question arises later, I would say that hon. Members are rather chasing a red herring. As the Bill applies to trade or sewage effluent, the danger of pesticides and herbicides going through is very small. The much greater danger is through drift and in the actual application of the these pesticides and herbicides, rather than a question of trade or sewage effluent. I say this in the hope that this argument is not raised again in the Committee, because it does not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will appreciate, bearing in mind the geography of certain farms, that there could be drainage into a stream taking the farm effluent of a fair volume of insecticides and chemicals used as fertilisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree concerning chemicals used as fertilisers, because the effluent in that case is mainly not so much of a harmful nature. I agree about the dangers of pesticides and herbicides. It is not so much a question of what goes through the sewage effluent but rather a question of drift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Therefore, it does not come within the terms of the Bill. That, however, is a small point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we must appreciate when considering agriculture in relation to the Bill is that no economic treatment of farm sewage has yet been discovered. I know from experience of a scheme—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what he has said about treatment, will the hon. Member explain how the farmer was able to utilise the middens, which he used to clean and take for the nutriment of the fields?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will wait, perhaps he will hear the reason. We are talking about effluent and discharges, not about middens and the organic matter in a solid form, but what comes out in liquid form. No economic treatment has yet been found for bringing farm effluent up to a standard which river purification boards will accept. I know from experience of schemes for purification costing more than the value of the farm. Even so, the engineers putting forward the schemes have not given any guarantee that the effluent produced from the treatment would necessarily be accepted by the river purification board. This is at the base of the problem which faces farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, to put the matter simply, in face of these facts a farmer can choose between three courses of action. First, he can stop farming. Secondly, he can change over from a stock type of farming—because it from stock farming that the problem arises—to animal farming, in which the amount of effluent is greatly decreased. This is not possible for many farmers. That is particularly true of farms on the West Coast of Scotland, areas which are ideally suited for growing grass and not for growing arable crops. Some farmers may be able to do this, but many cannot. Even if they can change, we must appreciate the tremendous expense of changing over from one form of production to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the farmer is left with the third possibility of collecting his effluent and spraying it on to his field. There is no question, as the Under-Secretary of State has said, that this is of extreme value and is good husbandry. As I have said, one appreciates the work of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
colleges of agriculture in working out the manurial value and the different methods of making this possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in spraying the effluent back on to the land, which is good husbandry, one still gets trouble from the soil structure. If a farm is on clay soil, it will spoil the soil structure and thereby reduce the fertility of the farm if too much water is applied. Another problem is that in certain conditions, even when the effluent is sprayed back on to the ground, the soil becomes saturated with water, as happens at this time of year, and the effluent finds its way back into the ditches. Certainly, it is not nearly as noxious as it might have been, but that is the kind of thing that farmers must face. That is why we ask the Government to give serious consideration to the difficulties facing farmers. We are not making difficulties. We want to see the rivers cleaned up as much as anyone else, but we want the Government to appreciate, as I think they are beginning to do, that we have special problems and to look after fanners in dealing with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a passing acquaintanceship with the operations of fanning and I have some interest in the building industry. From those two points of view, I see practical difficulties in not accepting the Amendment. If we do not accept it, we could cause a great deal of unnecessary expenditure on a project which, as the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has said, is as indefinite as the purification of farm effluent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is all very well to say, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said, that farmers are eligible for grants for improvements such as these, that is not the be-all and end-all of the problem. Irrespective of the source of the money, whether it is from a private or a public purse, unless the money is to be effective and give a proper return, it is money wasted. It is just as important to save money from the public purse as from the private purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I have a passing acquaintanceship with farms and with buildings. It is from this point of view that I draw attention to the practical difficulties of trying to implement all that the Bill contains. I said earlier in an intervention that many farms are old. They have been built often along river banks,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
on a high part of the bank, so as to be near the water supply when no piped water was available. In trying to discharge their effluent, they have been restricted in the area where the effluent can be discharged, even for seepage purposes, before going to the river from the septic tank. There are practical difficulties in farms of that type meeting their obligations under this part of the Bill. We must look at these problems from a practical and reasonable standpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I counsel my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to do. While they may have been left the legacy of the Bill from the previous Government, I hear the echoes of their voices as they would have been propounding some of the points which I am making today if perchance the Government had been of a different complexion. I counsel my hon. Friends not to be too bigoted in this matter and not to think that because they have become the custodians of an office for a period, they need to carry on in the way that their predecessors have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I am a member of the National Farmers' Union and I express my interest in the matter from that viewpoint. There is some good sense in the Clause, and good sense should commend itself to this side of the Committee. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to consider the practical difficulties in operating the Bill as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not gainsay for one moment the practical difficulties referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). There certainly are difficulties, but it should be our desire to overcome them if a sufficiently strong case can be advanced for the principle we advocate. I appreciate the very reasonable contribution made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). He gave as much support as he could to the principles outlined in the Bill, as did the Scottish National Farmers' Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know how far we can go towards getting cleaner rivers, cleaner estuaries and cleaner shores under the operation of the Bill. What are the real difficulties? Fairly generous grants are
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
available. In my boyhood, farm effluents were sprayed to a greater extent than they are today. Does the present-day more scientific young farmer, who has had greater opportunity to equip himself for his task by college education, lack something that his forebears had? I agree that he is well in advance of them in other things—for example, in the use of sprays and fertilisers. May I be told why farmers in bygone days used farm effluent? They regarded the ammonia content as valuable for the land. Such difficulties as a clay subsoil can be overcome by the application of some other material. It must be recognised that, in some areas at any rate, the separation of effluent from ordinary household waste could be made. Ready access to the sea could be provided at a not too great cost. If the cost is such that it will injure good husbandry and agricultural output, let us hear about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the sort of problem which must be tackled. Does it mean that a further grant will have to be made here, there or somewhere else? I am prepared to go as far as I can in grant aid to achieve the prime purpose of the Bill, which is to rid rivers and estuaries of the pollution which is presently pouring into them. Although the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns did not mention this, regard must be paid to the coming into being of the factory farm. A very great volume of effluent could be poured into rivers from factory farms, but this must be controlled. If there is not sufficient financial backing for the factory farm to enable it to install equipment to separate the noxious elements and get them out of danger in a separate sewer, we must tackle the problem in some other way. We want industry to increase its output so as to help Scotland's economy. However, we must realise what the Bill is trying to do and give it all the support we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) about the authorship of the Bill, I have great hesitation about moving the Amendment. However, no matter who the author of the Bill was, I think that it is absolutely essential to move the Amendment, because in one line the river purification authority is referred to as "it" and "they".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And are they not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is as it may be. The authorship of the Bill aside, I am surprised at the Minister of State allowing this matter to pass. He will to some extent try to amend it. Although I do not see his name on the back of the Bill, he has taken a very great interest in the Bill, because he has been sitting here all morning. He might well have redrafted this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the worst pieces of drafting I have ever seen. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The Under-Secretary is now responsible for the Bill. He produced it. It was up to him to put it right. It is difficult to make out on a first reading what the subsection means. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a river purification authority refuses to consent to an application for its consent …"</p></blockquote>
This is the most extraordinarily tautological way of expressing anything. I suggest that my Amendments would to some extent improve the wording because then it would simply say
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a river purification authority refuse their consent …"</p></blockquote>
As the Clause has previously mentioned consent several times, it is quite unnecessary to use the tautological words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to an application for its consent".</p></blockquote>
The Minister of State appears to agree with me, because he himself wishes to delete the words "for its consent". I move the Amendment purely in an effort to make the Bill more intelligible. I hope that on this occasion at least the Under-Secretary will be able to agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would prefer to clash with me rather than to clash with a verb. If we accepted his Amendment, we should clash with a verb. I am sorry
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
about that. However, if we accepted the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, which was deliberately tabled to meet the objection raised by the hon. Gentleman, that would clarify the matter. It is a pure drafting matter and I concede the hon. Gentleman's point. I therefore suggest that it would be better to accept the Amendment in page 2, line 16, to leave out "for its consent". If we were to accept the hon. Gentleman's Amendments, the phrasing would still be a little untidy. I respectfully suggest to him that that would be the case, although we would grant him sponsorship of the Government Amendment in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will know that this provision of the Bill is drawn in exactly the same way as the provision in the English Act of 1961. It seems to some of my hon. Friends and me that there are certain conditions in Scotland which make it more difficult for us to accept three months. We believe that there is an argument for extending the time, or alternatively, as the second Amendment suggests, for giving some latitude to the board to meet the difficult situations which exist in certain parts of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
the country, where it would be more difficult to comply with the conditions which may be set by the board than it is in more populous areas. This applies particularly to highland and island areas and to very remote places, which may themselves be of great importance to the head waters of various streams and rivers. We believe that there is in the case of a Scottish Measure, as opposed to the English Act, some case for giving consideration to extending the period beyond three months to six months. I hope that the Under-Secretary will feel inclined to accept one or other way of carrying this into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The second Amendment is unnecessary, because river purification authorities have power to frame conditions having effect after a period of three months. The specified period in Clause 1(3) cannot commence until the expiration of three months referred to in subsection (6). The three months is the prescribed minimum, and there is no restriction on the authority imposing conditions to take effect as from
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
a future date beyond three months from the date of the consent. This is why the second Amendment is in a sense unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said in a way answers the case for the first Amendment. The second Amendment is unnecessary. The first would be unacceptable because, as I think the hon. Gentleman realises, it would make a delay all round, which would be undesirable. If there were special practical difficulties in any one case, an exception could be made under certain conditions. There is, in other words sufficient proviso in this to meet the hon. Gentleman's point without accepting either Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
