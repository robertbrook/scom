	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [10th December],</i> in page 5, line 38, leave out subsection (2).—	<i>[Mr. Hendry.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be glad to hear that the speech on which I embarked at the end of our last Sitting will not last long. As I was saying, however, it seems desirable that a standard should be laid down for purification of effluents entering a stream. This largely depends upon the river concerned. The standard might vary from one river to another. Indeed, it might vary from one part of a river to another. A great deal of money could be wasted in carrying purification too far. It is desirable that some facility should exist for prescribing the standard of purification required. That is precisely what Section 25 (1,	<i>a</i>) of the 1951 Act does. I do not know whether that 1951 provision has proved to be effective, but it might have useful application in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State probably knows that a great deal of work has been done over the years on water pollution and purification by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and that research is still going on. It might well be that the standards pre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
scribed would require modification from time to time and, possibly, as good a way of doing this as any other is by means of byelaws. I therefore ask the Under-Secretary to tell the Committee whether he does not, on reflection, consider that that would be a useful provision to maintain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to me after study of the scientific documents that probably a useful standard to set from time to time would be, say, the reduction of the polluting load to one-quarter less than that which on calculation would just be small enough to avoid nuisance. That seems to me to be a fitting criterion for purification. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me know whether he considers that a byelaw might not be the best way to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like the Under-Secretary to cover this point. I realise that the power to make byelaws may not have been much used and that that may be one of the reasons, perhaps the most important reason, the hon. Gentleman will give. I should, however, be grateful if he could tell us whether this means that it has been decided not to be worth while to try to prescribe standards. The byelaws were supposed to attempt to prescribe standards, and I wonder whether, in practice, it was found to be too difficult to undertake this task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is very much "Yes". The task of trying to prescribe standards, and, furthermore, to observe them, particularly when new discharges came into being, has proved to be difficult. It is true that no byelaws have been made either in England or in Scotland under this provision. The legislators, no doubt, thought it wise, the administrators no doubt helped them along, and Parliament was, no doubt, coaxed into agreeing to it, but the technicians and the authorities concerned could not formulate sufficient byelaws to put them into operation. That is the short answer, that in practice it has not proved workable. Therefore, it is thought undesirable that we should continue this reserve right for the boards. I am sorry that I do not think that we should accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>(REVIEW AND VARIATION OF
<br><br><!-- lb --> CONDITIONS GOVERNING DISCHARGES AND NEW OUTLETS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 5, line 45, to leave out from "Act" to "and" in line 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this Amendment is to inquire why the conditions to be satisfied before a discharge is made or an outlet is brought into use should not be included among the conditions which from time to time can be reviewed and altered. It may be that a condition which was made at the time when an application for a new discharge was submitted under Section 28 of the 1951 Act has become out of date. It could be due to modernisation or to a major change in processing by an industrial concern. It seems strange that the conditions which were laid down for a new discharge or altered outlet, which is how I understand the words in parenthesis, in the period from 1951 to 1964 before the Bill becomes an Act should not be included amongst those which can be reviewed or varied under the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give examples, it is possible that a new discharge for which permission was given, say, 10 years ago could, 11 years later, be reconsidered by an industrial firm. That firm may have found a means of improving the purification processes; it could have installed a new purification plant. It might, therefore, want to produce a greater volume of effluent than the maximum which was laid down as one of the conditions. In view of the improved purification, that might be entirely acceptable. Alternatively, it could be that because of a new process the temperature would be much higher than originally but without any harmful effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be that such a change, and the desire of the industrial undertaking which I have used as an example, would constitute a new discharge. That would mean that the whole process of Section 28 of the 1951 Act would have to be gone through again. That may be the inter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
pretation which the Under-Secretary will give, that because the conditions are to be altered the discharge would become a new discharge requiring a new application under the 1951 Act. In that case, is it really necessary that this should be done? Is it really necessary that it should, in these circumstances, automatically become a new discharge and have to be treated under the 1951 Act? Would it not be simpler to be included in the Clause as a condition which could be reviewed and altered? If that is not so, I should be grateful for an explanation why it should be necessary to go back to the 1951 Act in each case of alteration of the condition for a new discharge—that is to say, something which has been brought into use between 1951 and 1965.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member has said is perfectly fair. From what he has said, the Amendment would seem to be a desirable one because it would not only help the river purification boards but it would even help the discharger. Unless, however, we leave these words in the Clause, we shall create a situation which is, perhaps, impracticable and which certainly might be onerous on an industry or on a local authority concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has given an example in the case of an industry. If a new industry, for example, installed plant to comply with the conditions applicable before the discharge was made, it would experience difficulty. The 1951 Act, like the English Act of 1961, recognised the difficulties by accepting for review conditions to be satisfied before a new discharge was made or an outlet was brought into use. Those conditions should be once and for all conditions and they should be spent before the discharge is made or the outlet is brought into use. There should be no need, therefore, for a purification authority to review these conditions. I agree that it might be argued that a condition which had to be satisfied before a discharge was made or an outlet was brought into use might be impracticable; it might have changed its character, and so on. That would then be a new discharge within the meaning of the Bill. To get himself out of this situation, the discharger should apply for consent to the new discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
Numerous examples come to mind, including an electricity authority for example and its tremendous use of water. A local authority, in building a sewer might find, if these conditions were removed, that the sewer did not come out at the right place and struck rock and that the outlet had to be diverted. There are a number of practical cases where, if we removed the words in question, we would put the discharger in. a disadvantageous position. I agree that the balance is a fine one, but this is a very practical matter. While it may seem that we are, in a sense, protecting the position of the discharger, it would be unfair to take out these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation and for the fact that he agrees that there is a balance of argument. I should like an assurance from the Government that if a firm or local authority finds that because of modernisation or improvement it has again to go through the process laid down in Section 28 of the 1951 Act this will not be a great procedure for such an undertaking and that it will be understood that it is having to go through this process of reapplication for a new discharge. I entirely understand that there may be difficulties about making a change of this kind in the Bill, but I want to be sure that a firm or a local authority will not meet additional and unnecessary difficulty by having to go through the process again. I see the hon. Gentleman nodding. If I can take that as assent I shall be glad to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to follow the intention here. What is expected of anyone carrying out this job? Does this mean that where an industrialist has had permission from the river purification authority and it is necessary to divert pipes or alter the tanks it would be unnecessary for him to go back to the river purification authority to get altered permission? I should like some clarification from my hon. Friend as to what is intended here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that this is a part which I spent some time on, trying to consider the balance of argument. If one is tempted to accept the Amendment and make our legislation different from the English Act, it also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
means that we are placing a greater responsibility on river purification boards and thus on dischargers. For example, the river purification authority could be extremely awkward, and in a sense unfair, perhaps, with dischargers who got into difficulties over arranging for discharges for which they had obtained prior consent, and who may have spent a lot of money. It may seem, at first sight, much more advantageous to leave the balance of the decision with the public authorities rather than with the discharger. I think that that would be too harsh. If the hon. Gentleman is willing to press me on this I may consider it again; I believe, on balance, however, that we should leave the words in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked if I could give an assurance about river purification boards and authorities being reasonable with applicants. I hope that they will always be reasonable, though, of course, I cannot guarantee it absolutely. At least, if they go through the old procedure they have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State. This preserves any balance of dispute which there might be and keeps it in proper perspective. On the whole, I should imagine that people would be sensible about this. When dischargers are in these difficulties, the boards, one would hope, would act sensibly in relation to the discharge, and help them. This would mean reviewing these new consents when they are applied for, because it would be a matter of considerable hardship to the discharger once he was in this position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I think that on balance it would be best if we left the words in. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me and that my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) will be satisfied that we are trying to preserve the balance between the river purification boards and the work of the dischargers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did beg leave to withdraw the Amendment, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment again, if that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member did not withdraw on the last occasion. If he had it would have been necessary for me to put the Question. I thought he was thinking about it rather than doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 5, line 46, after "may" to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the event of there being any material alteration in the particulars furnished by the person making application for consent to the discharge or in the condition of the stream into which the effluent is discharged or flows".</p></blockquote>
This Amendment falls into two parts, the first relating to the event of there being any material alteration in the particulars furnished. When we were discussing Clause 1 we had a discussion on the conditions laid down in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(d)</i> in subsection (2) and it seemed to me that there was some onus on the river purification board not to review the conditions unless there was a specific change in the particulars which had been furnished by the applicant for the discharge. The second part relates to the condition of the stream into which the flow is discharged or flows. There are various things which might crop up, one of which has been discussed in my County of Fife—the use by the County Council of Loch Leven as a water supply and the effect on the river of the discharge going down to the sea. There is a similar position in other parts of Scotland, with the introduction of hydroelectric works, which in many cases have diverted the headwaters of one stream into the waters of a completely different watershed. This might produce altogether different circumstances, outside the control of the people making the decision. This Amendment would provide a safeguard for the dischargers, if it were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause as it is at present requires the river purification authority to review conditions imposed under the provisions of the Bill and the 1951 Act, other than the conditions imposed before the discharge is made or an outlet is brought into use. Authorities may, however, give the discharger or the person using the outlet a licence varying or revoking conditions. The Secretary of State can also direct the authority to vary or revoke conditions, as in subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the discharge has materially altered so that it ceases to correspond with the particulars furnished by the applicant, that is a change of circumstances known to him. As the conditions imposed on him by the river purification authority would no longer be related to the discharge, the applicant would normally apply to the authority for a further revised consent. Furthermore, a material
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
alteration in the nature of the discharge would probably make the discharge a new or altered discharge and so bring it within the terms of Section 28 of the 1951 Act, which calls for the consent of the river purification authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the other leg of the Amendment, that is to say the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"any material alteration in the condition of the stream into which the effluent is discharged or flows"</p></blockquote>
this is a matter for consideration by the river purification authority, because a discharger might be unaware of a material alteration in the condition of the stream. The river purification authority would guard against material alterations in the condition of the stream by imposing appropriate conditions on new applicants for consent, and they would review the conditions in relation to existing discharges from time to time. In this case it is unnecessary to press the Amendment, because the power is already covered. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can accept my explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary of State can answer my point about the hydroelectric boards diverting quite a section of the water. This would reduce the flow and might make unacceptable all the discharges. What safeguard is there for the people who had consent, who discover that because 50 per cent. of the water has gone, the level is now unacceptable to the board and they are going to alter the conditions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very fair. The balance is not between the board and the dischargers, but between the board and the Secretary of State, because the Secretary of State would not give consent to the hydroelectric board carrying out certain schemes, the consequences of which would be made known to him technically. The dispute therefore would be at the level of the river purification board with the Secretary of State against the proposed scheme of the hydroelectric board. This is the situation. If it transpired that the river purification board lost in this argument and the Secretary of State sanctioned the hydroelectric scheme which had these consequences, either foreseen or unforeseen, the board would have to look at its whole position in relation to the consents which it gave, because of the material alteration in the flow of the stream, which had been caused by an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
action of the Secretary of State or the hydroelectric board. The onus then falls on the board to review all its consents in the light of this. This would presuppose that the Secretary of State had been ill-advised and that the river purification board had not been following the correct course of action. I would find that very difficult to believe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W.Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very interesting point. I am mindful of the fact that there are certain rivers, such as the River Carron, where the reservoir is in the catchment area. By provisional order, when the Carron reservoir was being established, it was laid down that certain compensating waters were to be put into the altered river. This in turn goes down the river and is used for purification purposes for certain industries. If the implication of this Bill were put into operation, one might find that certain industries would have to establish settlement tanks and take a goodly proportion of the water now going back into the river into the settlement tanks and have it diverted away, leaving the River Carron almost denuded of water, to meet the requirements of the sanctions given under the Bill and the 1951 Act. It would mean, therefore, if the full implications of this Bill were then put into operation, that people would be forced to alter the whole of their septic tanks. That would affect even the local authorities with their river purification works, and the sewage purification works. They would have to be altered to meet the requirements of the very much reduced flow of water down the river. This might mean a considerable cost to many people, many industries and many local authorities, whereas the compensating waters bring the flow up to the requirement of the legislation to correct the reduced flow of the water going down the river owing to certain industries using the water for settlement tanks and so diverting it away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would hope that the Secretary of State would have all these matters in mind. Of course, he may be able to arrange for compensating waters to add sufficiently to the river flow from the diverted part to make up for the diverted part. This is quite possible. The trouble is that we are dealing with generalities here, about situations which are, by their very nature, specific. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
Secretary of State has to have regard for river purification authorities' opinions and has to consider the river purification authorities' relationship with the dischargers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are arguing about is the proper methods of the Secretary of State in maintaining a balance of interests. The Committee can rest assured that my right hon. Friend will observe this balance of interest. I can go no further than saying that the Amendment is not necessary because it is covered in these two ways. If there were any difficulty over this, the Secretary of State would make sure that there were sufficient compensating waters to meet the problem posed by the river purification authority, which is the responsible body for ensuring that the interests of dischargers are not adversely affected by any schemes which the Secretary of State may approve for hydroelectric or other industrial development which may be required to take place. Accordingly, I suggest that the Amendment, although it has drawn this to our attention, is not necessary at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in my hon. Friend saying that the Amendment is not necessary and that the Secretary of State's power is sufficient. If he is talking about the possibility of compensating water being made more plentiful, I know that in the case of the Carron reservoir this is quite impossible, because the full volume of the water in the reservoir is completely earmarked and sometimes the compensating water is not up to the full specification of the provisional order passed many years ago. Therefore, I think that we would be in some difficulty in this respect, but I am reassured in some way to hear the Under-Secretary of State say that full powers are vested in the Secretary of State and sensible attitudes will be adopted when a matter such as this comes up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Under-Secretary of State on one point. Has the Secretary of State any powers to compensate dischargers into a river from which the flow has been diverted? If he has, this Amendment is unnecessary. However, it may well be that the Secretary of State will find that in the public interest it will be best for him to agree to divert the headwaters of a river.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
There might then be six dischargers faced with the situation that the flow was so altered that it would not be practicable to allow them to go on discharging. Therefore a sewer, or something like that, would probably have to be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would have to bear the expense of doing this? If the Amendment is unnecessary, is it not right in the interests of fair play to put in the Bill something to safeguard dischargers? We do not want the Secretary of State to have to act against the public interest in looking after five or six dischargers. We want to make the best possible use of water supplies, which we know are limited. If I could have a reassurance on that point, I should feel much happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something in this Amendment. It could operate in a different way from that which the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) envisages. His Amendment refers to "the condition of the stream". I asked my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State a question about this at an earlier stage of the Bill. If the volume of effluent going into a stream has been multiplied to such an extent that it should not take any more, the condition of the stream has altered, and it might be that a greater discharge of noxious effluent, or any new discharge, would not be allowed. If the condition of a stream has become that which I have envisaged, has the board power to say, "The condition of the stream has altered. There is more effluent than water, and we cannot allow a greater volume to flow into it"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very difficult point to deal with, because there are no powers of compensation, in this Bill. In the last analysis, I am told that under common law industry abstracting water from a stream could be interdicted if it did not return the same quantity and quality of water to the stream. Obviously there is some basic legal protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we may be making too much difficulty about this matter, because any proposed action on the part of industry, whether public or private, whether it be a hydro-electric scheme or a local authority scheme, would require planning consent, apart from all the other complications. This means that a public
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
inquiry would have to be held. At such an inquiry, these problems would be considered. If the river purification board were alarmed at the position of its own discharges and the condition of a river, under this proposal its objections would be made public and the consequences of the action would become clearer. It seems incredible to believe that a Secretary of State would so order that this be done and that, not only would a stream become more polluted, but that many people would suffer for no other reason than that they were dischargers. This situation would be wholly improbable, in my view, unless something went wrong with the Secretary of State, which again is highly improbable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are getting to the bounds of complete improbability. I admit that this situation could arise, but many other absurd situations could arise and we cannot legislate in respect of all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one goes up the road to Inverness, one find that there is no water where the headwaters of the River Garry should be. I imagine that there are discharges from houses already going into that non-existent river.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a hypothetical question. The paper mill industries of, say, Denny have certain agreements with the riparian owners concerning the quantities of water which they have the right to take from the River Carron. My memory goes back thirty years to the time when the provisional order was placed before the House of Commons. I understood that the paper industries were prepared to waive their rights on condition that fair compensation water would be put in the River Carron after the reservoir had been established in order that sufficient water could, after the process of purification, be drawn off. This compension water was sufficient to meet the requirements of the various dischargers right down the river banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill becomes law, and a rigid attitude is adopted to prohibit the paper industry redischarging this water which it is at present using, and if it is forced to take water away from the bed of the river, the river bed will almost dry up and the discharges from other sources down the river will be far in excess of those allowed by the river purification board. If the river purification board insists on local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
authorities and private discharges purifying their effluent so that it comes up to the new standards required, from where will the compensation come? This is a most important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be very important, but we are not dealing with that matter. We are dealing with the question of consent being given to discharges and the condition of the stream. We are not in this Amendment dealing with compensation water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is in this situation. First, there are problems in certain rivers, and certain developments are projected. The river purification board, by argument, must be in default of its own obligation—that is, it is not making a protest, or is not making its protest effectively. Secondly, it follows that the Secretary of State, in accepting a scheme, is bound to order a public inquiry to take place. Provisional orders may be involved. It depends on the precise nature of the development. A large number of people and institutions would have to go terribly wrong before any of these situations arose. I find that highly improbable. If we were to write in a provision for compensation in the light of this topsy turvy situation, it could not be done in this Bill, and it could not be done in this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respect the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour). I know that this is a problem which could arise. I respect the fact that there are difficulties. But essentially the work of the river purification boards in relation to discharges is a matter of balance and good sense. I hope that all the other people concerned in the development of industry and whose activities may affect the condition of rivers will exercise the same good sense. However, I do not think that we should incorporate the Amendment in the Bill, because it would not meet the particular instance which the hon. Gentleman has advanced and would not, in general, add anything to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to take part in this discussion, but it seems to me that the Under-Secretary of State has, to a large extent, misconceived the intention behind the Amendment. There might be a very material alteration in the character of the river, not only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
because of the abstraction of water farther up the river, but because of the abstraction of effluent at the behest of the river purification board. That might have the effect of decreasing very materially the amount of water available for the dilution of effluent, and a completely new set of circumstances might arise. That would not be a matter for a public local inquiry or a special act, but purely an administrative act. Circumstances might arise requiring immediate action to be taken by the river purification authority. I ask the Under-Secretary of State to look at this matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Steele.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for these Amendments is that, even after very careful reading, I was not sure what subsection (3) meant. I thought that I knew what it meant, but in order to make it abundantly clear that it meant what I thought it meant I tabled
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
these Amendments. The effect of accepting them would be to make the subsection read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No subsequent notice under subsection (1) of this section shall take effect before the expiration of the period specified in a previous statement under subsection (2) of this section except with the consent in writing of the person to whom the notice is given."</p></blockquote>
Without the Amendments, I do not think the subsection makes sense, or at any rate it is not clear what the sense is. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will accept the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) prohibits the giving of notice under subsection (1)—that is, a notice varying or revoking the conditions imposed under the Bill and the principal Act—till after expiry of the period of not less than two years during which the conditions imposed cannot be changed. The policy behind that is that notices should ensure a stable period of conditions, because if we allow the possibility of intimation to be given of variations during that period it would weaken the whole idea of providing stability of conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of the word "subsequent" by Amendment No. 49 appears to suggest that there may be two or more notices relating to the one discharge and that the first notice—for example, a notice given under subsection (1)—would not be subject to the prohibition provided by subsection (3). But this would mean that a condition could be varied within the specified period which, in the Government's view, would be undesirable because it would defeat the purpose of specifying the period during which conditions cannot be varied. Amendments Nos. 50, 51 and 52 would allow the conditions to be varied, and that would completely cut across the idea of giving stability of conditions for that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the Government do not like any of these Amendments. They would upset considerably the policy of giving stability. The river purification boards would not like them, either. Therefore, even though the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has tried hard to make the subsection clearer and to alter the policy, I recommend the Committee not to accept the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"or under subsection (4) of the said section 28".</p></blockquote>
The Clause provides for an appeal to the Secretary of State against refusal of consent by a river purification authority under the Bill or under Sections 22, 24 or 28 of the 1951 Act and against the terms of any such consent. It also provides for appeal against the terms of any notice given by the river purification authority under Clause 1(5) relating to existing discharges. But it does not provide for appeal against the terms of a notice under Section 28(4) of the 1951 Act relating to new discharges. This is an omission which the Government seek by the Amendment to remedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this addition which helps to meet a point which I raised earlier about certain conditions being fulfilled and the procedure for new discharges under Section 28 of the 1951 Act having to be gone through. The hon. Member pointed out that the appeal procedure would be available under that Section. The Amendment makes it clear that it will be available. That is why, on balance, I agreed with him that it was better to stick to the procedure prescribed in the Bill. I am glad that this addition has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are purely drafting Amendments which, I hope, commend themselves; to the Under-Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Government's view these are not innocent drafting Amendments. We had a clash on verbs earlier in the Committee. Now we have a clash on nouns. The substitution of "him" for "the Secretary of State" in line 15 in our view does not improve the wording because it puts the pronoun before the noun and leaves the reader in doubt as to the person to whom the appeal is made until he reaches "the Secretary of State", for which the Amendment would substitute "he", which would make it even more confusing. It seems better to have "the Secretary of State" coming first so that the person to whom the appeal is to be made is identified at the beginning of the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is read in conjunction with subsections (1) and (2), it will be seen that there are variants of the word "he" and as to whom is meant by "he". It would be better to leave the subsection as it is. Although the hon. Member is intent on tidying up the Bill. I suggest, with respect to him, that this would not do a good job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister of State did not break his silence and give us the benefit of his view on "shall", which I believe to be very pronounced.

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>In page 7, line 20, leave out "or, as the case may be" and insert "and", in line 21, leave out "and"; in line 22, leave out "a" and insert:

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for the convenience of the Committee to group these Amendments. The first is a material Amendment because it may well be that an appellant or would-be appellant desires
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
something but for reasons best known to himself, possibly expenditure, he does not require it. A desire may be unspoken, but if he requires something, that is a positive act which he has to express. It is customary in legislation of this sort to use the word "required" in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining Amendments in the group follow that point except that which refers to leading evidence. The Clause provides that a person will have an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State, but it does not give him the power to lead evidence. In matters of this kind there may be great necessity to lead evidence, because frequently these are scientific matters requiring expert advice to the person hearing the inquiry. Much work has been done by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, but that information is not readily available and it is essential that the person hearing the inquiry should have an opportunity of obtaining evidence, and particularly expert evidence, in dealing with an application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that the Government gladly accept the first Amendment. The word "desire" is precedented in previous legislation and similar provisions in Section 3(11) of the Spray Irrigation (Scotland) Act, 1964, but it would not be entirely appropriate in this context and "require" seems to be an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to say that the Government would also like to adopt the Second Amendment. It could be argued that on the subsection as it stands the Secretary of State could hear the appellant without hearing the authority and 	<i>vice versa.</i> The intention is that both should get a hearing if they wish. This would be made clear by the Amendment. I am pleased to recommend to the Committee that we should accept that Amendment, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two out of four is not bad. Even the hon. Member, after his experience so far in Committee will recognise that. We are grateful to him for the work which he has done. In other words, I cannot accept the next two Amendments, The reason is that the effect of describing a person so appointed as "competent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
and independent" would be quite unnecessary. It could imply that the Secretary of State might appoint somebody who was incompetent or not independent of either the appellant or the river purification authority. The words are not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event, even if we accepted the implied strictures and incorporated it in the Bill, the Amendment is defective in so far as it provides that the appointment of the competent and independent authority is to be made "if so desired", which immediately raises the question of who desires this to be so. It is not clear whether this refers to a desire of the appellant, a desire of the authority or a desire of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment provides that the parties concerned, the appellant and the authority, would have the right to lead evidence before the person appointed. It is hardly conceivable that the Secretary of State or the person appointed by him would refuse to allow this even if it were not provided in the Bill. The words therefore seem unnecessary.

Member may have been anxious to pursue this Amendment in relation to other Amendments, and certainly they are connected with the discussion on Amendment 78, but we have moved an Amendment to leave out subsection (5) for drafting reasons. The Amendment is consequential on previous Amendments and it will be seen that Amendment No. 82 puts subsection (5) into Clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 85 are consequential on the acceptance of the New Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first Amendment repeals Section 22(7) of the principal Act which provides penalties for a person guilty of an offence under Section 22. The new Clause provides penalties for a person guilty of an offence under the section and accordingly subsection (7) is no longer necessary. Section 28(2) of the 1951 Act permits a river purification authority to impose conditions related to new or altered discharge outlets and to new discharges, Any person who did not observe these conditions was under Section 28(13) liable to conviction either summarily or on indictment. The proposed new Clause renders subsection (13) unnecessary, and it has been repealed by Amendment No. 85.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This repeal of subsection (13) means that any person who does not observe the conditions imposed under subsection (2) can no longer be said to be guilty of a contravention of Section 28. Before
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
the New Clause can bite, a person must be guilty of such a contravention. The addition of words in Amendment No. 84 enables the breach of conditions under subsection (2) to be caught as a contravention of Section 28 under the New Clause.

Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) might wish to speak before me about his proposals, but we are taking so much together at one go that we are still busily digesting the hon. Gentleman's explanation. The new Clause is one of the most important matters before us and I would be grateful for some further explanation of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I should like to explain something which it may be designed to cover when it takes the place of Clause 9. If the new Clause does cover it, I would not wish to pursue my Amendment to Clause 9, for that would be wasting the time of the Committee. Am I in order in discussing the point raised in that Amendment which, I believe, the new Clause is now designed to cover?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if the hon. Gentleman dealt with it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the new Clause covers this. It is a matter of importance to anglers, and I hope that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) will listen to what I have to say, because he is interested in everything connected with angling. Although this has a general application to Scotland, this matter was first raised with me by constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is that in order to establish experimental hatcheries for salmon it is quite the normal process to sterilise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
burns, that is to say, by a poisonous substance to exterminate the existing miscellaneous fish life in the bums. The reason is that these fish can be predators of the young salmon fry or rivals for the available food. Under safeguards and conditions, poison is introduced by persons concerned with fisheries in order to sterilise the burns before introducing salmon ova or fry, and this is done for experimental work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 9 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Protection (Scotland) Act, 1951, this process was permitted, subject to various conditions, for experimental and scientific purposes. The Secretary of State had to give permission and did so in a number of cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say Section 9 of the 1951 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the 1951 Prevention of Pollution Act. It is the 1951 Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act. However, the hon. Gentleman is on a good point and this is the issue to which I was just coming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently, a local river purification board has said that under Section 22 of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951, this sterilisation cannot be carried out because of its polluting effect. The two Sections of the two Statutes passed in the same year appear to be at odds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something which the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire and others concerned with angling and the fish resources of our rivers will appreciate. Those who wish to have successful experimental hatcheries are the people who, because of their concern with salmon fisheries, will be particularly keen to have clear, clean rivers. They are the last people to wish to pollute the rivers. Any sterilisation which they carry out with a poisonous substance will clearly be done in an extremely well organised way so that the poison is effective in the burn concerned and so that there are entirely adequate arrangements to ensure that it cannot run away to where it can cause pollution. These people concerned with freshwater fisheries are as keen as anyone else in the country to have clean rivers and to avoid pollution. It is extremely doubtful that such people
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
would carry out this process in a way which would cause pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue is important to freshwater fisheries and also raises the technical matter of making the Statutes consistent. I have had the benefit of expert legal advice on this from the last Solicitor-General for Scotland, now sitting beside me, the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). Fortified with his advice on the subject, I am sure that this is only a matter of putting this right in the course of dealing with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had to explain this because it was not immediately apparent from any Amendment which I was able to put on the Notice Paper. My Amendment has now been overtaken by this new Clause 2, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell me that the new Clause as drafted covers the issue, although a quick look through it leads me to believe that it does not. I have deployed my description of the problem at a little length, but I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree that this is an interesting matter. I hope that if the Under-Secretary cannot deal with it this morning he will be able to say that it can be dealt with appropriately later. I cannot believe that there can be any objection to this scientific or experimental process being carried out by persons who clearly have a great interest in the rivers not being polluted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2) of the new Clause has wording identical to that in Clause 9(2). It rescinds Section 22(3) of the 1951 Act. At first sight this provision is completely outrageous and unreasonable and because of that I feel that I must have misread it or misunderstood it in some way. As I read it, the provision removes the defence that it is not reasonably practicable to dispose of polluting matter otherwise than by discharging it into a stream and the defence that the person concerned is taking all reasonably practicable steps to prevent the matter from being unnecessarily poisonous, noxious or polluting. If some-one is doing all he can to make the substance non-noxious and has no possible practicable alternative to putting the matter into a stream, that should be a complete excuse for any contravention of the terms of the Bill. In the subsection which is to be deleted, this defence is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
If we are to get the co-operation of industry, as the Under-Secretary hopes, it is a little unreasonable to preclude the defence of industrialists who might be able to prove that they could do nothing practicable other than to discharge the matter ino a river or burn. This seems to be so completely unreasonable that I feel that I must have misunderstood the provision in some way, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give me a complete explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary was perfectly right to say that my name was originally put to the Amendment for a reason entirely different from his. My reason was that the subsection which it is proposed to leave out would strike out the criterion of reasonableness in the actings of a river authority. However, the new Clause is even worse and a completely unreasonable situation may now be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must repeat that industry generally welcomes the Bill, but it expects that the powers which are proposed will be exercised reasonably. It is completely incomprehensible that the Government should go out of their way to cut out any reference to reasonableness wherever it occurs in the 1951 Act. Whatever may have been said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) about the legal niceties of reasonableness, it seems that we are inviting river pollution authorities to behave completely unreasonably if they are so minded. The Committee has to take into account that a river officer is a professional man out for professional perfection so far as he can get it, and that his job is to clean a river, and that he often regards the job of cleaning the river irrespective of all other considerations, reasonable or not. To cut out "reasonableness" from the legislation would invite him to do just that. It is almost certain that in consequence, a great many matters will come to the Secretary of State for adjudication when an idustrialist, a local authority or whoever it may be feels that he or they have been treated in an unreasonable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find the extraordinary state of affairs that the Secretary of State, who is charged by Parliament with the duty of promoting the cleanliness of rivers, is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
acting as advocate and judge in the same cause. That does not seem to me to be reasonable. I do not suggest that the Secretary of State would do other than take a detached view, but it does not show that justice is seen to be done, and people must be very suspicious of anything of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, which proposes to change the 1951 Act in this respect, the scales appear to be unduly weighted against the applicant if he is the discharger. He is not being entitled to state as a defence to a criminal charge against him that he is taking all reasonable steps. He seems automatically to be put in a position of being guilty and he can adduce only what is set forth in Section 22(3) of the 1951 Act as arguments in mitigation of the penalty which is to be inflicted upon him. That is not a reasonable state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a man is charged with a criminal offence, he is surely entitled to bring to the notice of the court before he is convicted what is set forth in subsection (3)—that is, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not reasonably practicable for him to dispose of the matter otherwise than by discharging it (directly or indirectly) into that or some other stream"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is taking all reasonably practicable steps to prevent the matter from being unnecessarily poisonous, noxious or polluting".</p></blockquote>
I have mentioned time and again to the Committee the question of a reasonable standard. It might well be that a river authority might attempt to impose a completely unreasonable standard. As I pointed out earlier, the amount of money might be very large. I have cited one factory in my constituency where an unreasonable standard would mean an immediate expenditure of £140,000 which is a great deal of money. There is another factory in my constituency where, I understand, the imposition of what might be considered to be an unreasonable standard by any reasonable criterion would cost £247,000. These are serious figures for any industrialist or local authority, except a very large one. It is quite unjustifiable that the Government should seek to exclude these criteria of reasonableness which have existed in the legislation since 1951 and which have given rise to no trouble as a matter of practical administration.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
As to the remainder of the new proposals, I welcome subsection (1) of the Government's new Clause; it goes a good way to meet the objections which I have made to the Bill, especially its penal provisions. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that. As to his other Amendments, however, I find them completely abhorrent, and I advise the Committee, with all the power at my command, to resist them as being completely unreasonable and an absolutely unfair burden, not only on the Ministry, but on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know whether, in the course of my hon. Friend's experience in the office which he has held for such a short time—although I am sure that he must have looked into past records from previous holders of the office—he has found any proof that Clause 9(2) has been applied in a wrong way. The deletion of the "reasonably practicable" provision presupposes that there has been evidence that it has worked to the detriment of river purification boards in trying to clean the rivers. It does not seem to me to be correct to rule out "where it is reasonably practicable to dispose of the effluent in any other way". My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary should make a more valid case than has been made so far to convince me, at least, that this is the proper thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt again this gargantuan task which has been imposed upon me. I did not say anything about the Government's new Clause No. 2 because I thought that having ventilated it fully at our previous Sitting and having indicated on behalf of the Government that we had an open mind on the matter and were prepared to be convinced by the Committee, our approach would have been welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, however, all the arguments which have been raised in relation to this matter by, for example, my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) were ventilated fully at our last Sitting. I understood that that matter had been settled and that what we were now arguing was the question of the penalties and their continuing nature. That was why, later, we agreed to put down the Government's new Clause. I do not wish to sound aggrieved that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
Committee has not fully welcomed our proposals, but that was as far as the Government promised to go, and it meets the points which, in speeches and by affirmative nods of the head, were made obvious during our last Sitting as being what hon. Members wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In commenting on the Government's new Clause No. 2, which has been referred to by three hon. Members, I am obliged to comment on three Amendments to Clause 9 which are consequential on our discussion if we consider new Clause No. 2. Is that permissible, Mr. Steele? This will enlarge the number of discussions only to six and the number of Amendments to 12, but this is a hardworking Committee and I am prepared to develop the argument on the other three issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 9?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Steele, in relation to the argument on the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Protection (Scotland) Act, 1951, and its collision, if that is the right word to use, with the work of the river purification boards. This matter was raised by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) and I should like to comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member raised an important point. I have learnt two words in law since I became Under-Secretary. One is "wrongous" and the other is "lacuna", which I am told is a loophole. It would, however, appear that there is a point of considerable substance in what the hon. Member has said. There is a conflict between the provisions as they stand concerning river purification and salmon fishing. There is a further point that Section 9 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Protection (Scotland) Act, 1951, has no regard to the statutory functions of a river purification authority whose duty it is under Section 17 of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951, to promote the cleanliness of rivers in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment which the hon. Member has rightly promoted to cure those defects is welcome in the sense that it would ensure that the putting of fish poison in streams with the consent of the Secretary of State or of the district board would not be an offence under Section 22 of the Rivers Act, but it would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
still leave the situation unsatisfactory as it takes no account of the statutory functions of the river purification authority. I should like to accept the Amendment in principle subject to an Amendment of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Protection (Scotland) Act to protect the interests of river purification authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise fully the point which has been made in connection with Amendment No. 65, in Clause 9, page 10, line 7, but we are here doing something under the provisions of that Act. If, however, the use of poison is permitted to kill off pike, which is a rather predatory fish, there must be some recognition of the fact that it should not be used in circumstances in which other fish would also be killed off. I refer to trout. Many large landowners have no time for trout as such. Their interest is in salmon and sea trout. That is the value of their rivers or streams. We should not allow complete poisoning of the existing fish life in a stream, following which, over a three-year period there will be sterilisation and the putting in of salmon and sea trout to make it a valuable salmon and sea trout river which can be let at lucrative rents. I would certainly prohibit the use of that substance where the stream is regarded as being a good trout stream and angling clubs have facilities for fishing trout. We must pay regard to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in the middle of saying that I would in principle accept the Amendment. My hon. Friend has raised a good point, but I was not allowed to develop my comment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that my hon. Friend was an angler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but perhaps not a political more than a fishing angler. This is the biggest angle I have been involved in for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to say that I would accept the Amendment in principle by putting down a Government Amendment to provide that fish poisoning which was done with consent was not an offence under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951, if the consent was given by the Secretary of State in respect of fish and salmon. This would involve deleting the reference to permission of district boards in relation to Section 9 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
Protection (Scotland) Act, 1951. If we did this, the Secretary of State would in practice, before granting consent in any case, consult both the river purification authority and the district board. In other words, this would entail a separate Government Amendment, and on behalf of the Government I am prepared to table it for discussion at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), if the Amendment were so phrased it would allow the river purification authority the right of consultation in this regard. It would meet the point which my hon. Friend has raised, which, I admit, is not an easy one to avoid. In fact, it has to be very much taken in mind, and the Amendment which we hope to table, probably for Report, will be discussed by the House at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To pass to an entirely different matter, Amendment No. 71, in Clause 9, page 10, line 4, leave out subsection (2), on which comment was made by the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), would retain the defence in the 1951 Act, but the defence is no longer needed for discharges of trade or sewage effluent in view of Clause 4. In our view, it would be undesirable in the case of other discharges. I concede that the other discharges are not very many, but, nevertheless, we think that they are covered by other legislation. Discharges of trade effluent or sewage are covered in the provisions of Clause 4, which we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not comment earlier on Amendment No. 78, or on Amendment No. 79. The earlier Amendments which were negatived and upon which these new Amendments rest provide that where a notice calling for an application had been given, the consent of the river purification authority should not be "unreasonably withheld". The effect of the Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 would be to retain subsections (10) and (11) of Section 28 of the 1951 Act. Amendment No. 92 repeals that, which the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) seems to have overlooked. This would provide that any question whereby the consent of the river purification authority has or has not been "unreasonably withheld"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>135</span>
or as to the reasonableness of any condition or of any variation of any condition shall be determined by the Secretary of State. Clause 1(3) of the Bill provides that river purification authorities may grant consent subject to such conditions "as they may think fit". Under Clause 6(2), the Secretary of State on appeal may vary or revoke terms of any consent or any notice "as he may think fit". Members of the Committee will recollect the arguments on this matter in our earlier proceedings. I am glad that the Committee agreed with the Government on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
River purification authorities are public authorities and we would expect them to act reasonably, but, if not, there is the right of appeal to the Secretary of State, who is not restricted to deciding whether consent was reasonable or not. I am referring to earlier arguments because our discussion of these Amendments relates to present Clause 9 which is suggested may be replaced by new Clause No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered the Amendments which have been called. I have commented on Amendment No. 60—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said about Clause 4 giving a measure of protection, but what about an industrialist who does not get consent from the board and feels he has no alternative to putting the discharge into the stream? He has not even the defence of quoting this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has ample opportunity to plead his case in relation to the Act and if he is denied this he can go to the Secretary of State. The idea that he would be completely abandoned is quite absurd. This is just not so. The industrialist is adequately covered in this matter. If he took the law into his own hands, that would be a breach of the law, and he would be committing an offence. That would not be at all the right course of action to take. He would have to act under the provisions which we think are adequate. If the hon. Gentleman reads Clause 4 again and reviews earlier discussions he will see that, far from making it more difficult, we have made it a little less onerous on the dischargers who appeal to the Secretary of State by the words "see fit"
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
rather than confining him to the words as they were in the earlier Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with Amendment No. 60, Amendments Nos. 82, 83, 84 and 85, Amendments No. 78 and 79, Amendments Nos. 90, 91, and 92, which were consequential on the preceding Amendments 83, 84 and 85, and I have discussed new Clause No. 2. With them, through your kind indulgence, Mr. Steele, the Committee has been able to discuss the other Amendments which followed closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must realise that it was not my kind indulgence. I merely suggested to the Committee that those other Amendments might be taken with Amendment No. 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was so staggered that I could not object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was only because I was also, perhaps, staggered by the amount which we were going to consider together that I was not so appreciative of the new Clause to start with. We wanted to hear more about its intentions. Subsection (1) of the new Clause appears to meet the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and we therefore thank the Under-Secretary for putting that into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of the new Clause, with other Amendments concerning the word "reasonable", are matters with which my hon. Friend is not in agreement, and I entirely understand, and sympathise with, the point of view which he has put on this. It reflects again the matter which we discussed earlier in our proceedings and on which we held a different view on this side of the Committee. I recognise that the Government are taking a different view on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the question of the angling which I raised in my earlier intervention, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for recognising the point which I made and saying that he would, as I understand it, introduce the necessary Amendment at a later stage, but that it would not necessarily follow my wording. I quite understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) that I do not declare an interest in this because I am not an angler, not having done

any since I was disabled twenty years ago. I was very keen on it before that. Certainly I recognise that, in Scotland, salmon fisheries, trout fisheries, and opportunities of recreation, as well as stocking of fish, are important. These are valuable resources in various parts of Scotland. It is from that point of view that I raise this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that this is a question of sterilisation which would only take place in small stretches of small burns. It is not a question of wholesale poisoning of larger watercourses. Of course, that is another matter. This would occur in experimental hatcheries, which would be very limited in scope. It could only be carried out in conditions which safeguarded the lower reaches where the water has to go, and which would be perfectly fair for fish lower down. That is something which the persons who are carrying out such experiments would be keen, themselves, to ensure. They would not want to pollute the tributaries or the final river lower down. Therefore, from the point of view of the way in which I introduced this, I certainly agree that it is not a question of poisoning large stretches of larger streams; it is simply small burns with these experimental hatcheries. I thank the Under-Secretary for having taken the point about the freshwater fisheries which I raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>(APPLICATION OF ACT TO
<br><br><!-- lb --> TIDAL WATERS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 8, line 27, to leave out from "apply" to "as" in line 31 and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the tidal waters specified in the Second Schedule to the principal Act and to any tidal waters to which any of the provisions of the principal Act for the time being apply (with or without modification) by virtue of an order made under section 29 of that Act".</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment, although not perhaps its direct legal consequence, is to bring tidal stretches of the Clyde from Glasgow Green to Dunoon under some measure of control. Hon. Members may wonder at my putting for-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
ward a measure to widen the scope of this Bill, when my previous efforts have been directed towards diluting the Bill or making it less onerous on industrialists, but I fail to see any logic in a situation which, in one part of the Clyde, will put greater controls on industry, whereas no attempt whatever is being made to bring the tidal stretches under any control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, first of all, to prove the need for some measures to be taken. I think we can say that this is so, because I do not think that anyone would deny that the tidal stretches of the Clyde, particularly just below Glasgow Green, are foul-smelling, revolting and corrosive. I was not surprised to hear that several ship-owners have confirmed cases where corrosion of large ships and their machinery was taking place because of the corrosive effect of the water in the river. One or two points have been confirmed by the river board. It is a fact that from 8 to 10 miles downstream from Glasgow Green, the River Clyde is completely devoid of oxygen in dry weather. Sewage from the centre of Glasgow takes five to eight to go down to Erskine and one million people's undiluted sewage goes into these tidal stretches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to this is that when the Act was passed in 1951, it was decided that certain areas should be covered by the river purification boards, but the Clybe Board has not yet established its right—although it is 13 years later—to supervise or control river pollution in the full area which was envisaged when the Act was drawn up. Though it was said in the Schedules that the Forth and the Clyde tidal stretches should be covered, the Order has not yet been confirmed. Non-tidal stretches have been under supervision for some years and good progress has been made because the board has shown a reasonable attitude towards the genuine problems of traditional industry. However, the tidal stretches from Tidal Weir at Glasgow Green in the heart of Glasgow to an imaginary line from Clock Point to Castle Hill, Dunoon, are still not under the control or the jurisdiction of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To rectify this matter, the tidal Order was issued in draft form in 1962. It was intended that this should become effective in May, 1962. The result would have been to implement the Second Schedule to the parent Act of 1951, which defined
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
the tidal stretches of the Clyde and the Forth. One might have expected substantial objections by industrialists and those who were interested, but when this Order was considered at an inquiry, there was only one group of objections, and those were from people concerned about the emission of oil from vessels. No industrial objections were considered. It is rather strange to see that the reason given for not confirming the Clyde Order is that it would be too big a burden at one time on industry. When it was suggested that half this burden should be put on industry there was no objection. The question of oil from vessels was already subject to control under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955. There was no difference in principle; there was only a difference of degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is beginning to discuss Schedule 3 as well. Would it be for the convenience of the Committee to take Schedule 3 along with the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I was making was that the only difference in principle in the new Order would have been, first of all, that the penalties would have been greatly increased compared with the original Act and also the operation of the defence. There was no change of principle, and because there were no industrial objections to this Order it seemed that it was about to be brought into effect in the summer of this year. It seemed, in the words of the Under-Secretary, that the previous Secretary of State was on the brink of confirming the Order. If that had been done, there would have been no need for this Amendment. Then, as so often happens, unjustly, unreasonably and unexpectedly—tragedy struck.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What kind of tragedy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative Government ended their period of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Secretary of State has not confirmed this Order and, it seems that he has no intention whatever of doing so at the moment. A result of not confirming this Order has been that while
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
the oil dischargers, who were the only objectors to the previous Order, are subject to control, all other industry which did not object is free from any control in the tidal stretches.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the effect if we passed the Amendment? The Under-Secretary of State might say that there would be no effect at all. In the strictly legal sense, that is true, because, although this Order applied to it, if the board was not given jurisdiction to enforce it, the effect would be nil. But if we approved it, it would be necessary to implement the Order, which would bring about the result which I want to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say that the former Secretary of State would support the Amendment as he was about to confirm the Order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have not discussed the matter with the previous Secretary of State. The Under-Secretary of State said on Second Reading that he believed that the previous Secretary of State was about to confirm the order, but I have not had confirmation of that from my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the effect of the Amendment if it were accepted and backed up by the Order being enforced? There is only a small number of significant direct industrial effluent discharges in the Clyde estuary. It has been stated that the numbers are far fewer than is the case on the Forth, where an Order was implemented without much difficulty. We cannot afford to leave the position as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the only argument against the Amendment, although no doubt, the Under-Secretary of State will advance others, is that if we accept it and the Order is confirmed it may be too great a shock for industry. But if we do not accept the Amendment we are merely postponing the evil hour. This is something which will have to be done, and it might as well be done now or in the near future. There were no objections from industry when the previous Measure was brought forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, we should take steps to try to control in some measure the tidal stretches of the Clyde. Under the Bill and the previous Act no positive steps
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
have been taken to do that. If as a consequence of accepting the Amendment some move can be made in that direction, I shall be well satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, the effect of the Amendments would be to apply the provisions of Clauses 1 to 3, which give river purification authorities control over existing discharges, to all tidal waters listed as "controlled waters "in the Third Schedule. As the Bill stands, Clauses 1 to 3 can be applied to the controlled waters by an order made by the Secretary of State under Clause 8(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) has not emphasised is that the Order—and I do not want to blame the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) too much in this regard—and the objections taken to it—it is true that there were no industrial objectors—did not concern existing discharges. Therefore, we shall not achieve that which the Secretary of State might have achieved by promulgating the Order simply by accepting the Amendment. This is the substance of the argument. It is a question of how we can proceed timeously in relation to these discharges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not much reward is to be gained by discussing why the Clyde Order took so long; why the inquiry took so long; why the report was delayed so long; why the right hon. Member for Argyll did not confirm the Order; why all these things were not done more speedily under the previous Administration. It would not profit the Committee very much to discuss that. No doubt we can discuss it elsewhere, but it would be wrong at this stage, having inherited a situation in which no order was made apart from those in respect of the Forth and the Solway, to go too fast in relation to the Clyde or any other river because they had the misfortune of the Order not being confirmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment should not be accepted. If it were, it would impose a tremendous burden on the river purification authorities. It would bring into control all these discharges from outlets at once. It would be quite a shock to everyone concerned suddenly to be faced with this legal obligation and to have to go before the purification board, which, in turn, would be faced with a surprising amount of work which all had to be done
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
at one time. The first step to be taken in reducing pollution is to control new outlets and discharges in order to maintain the existing condition, and the next step is to get the river purification authority to apply to the Secretary of State for an order under Clause 8(2) to control existing discharges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Cathcart that it is the Government's intention to follow up the Bill with every endeavour, not only in relation to legislation next year, but in relation to these Orders. We are most anxious that the boards and authorities should get on with their work, because we do not intend to spend the next thirteen years in office repeating the languishing record of hon. Member's opposite. We shall not be in office for thirteen years; it will be twenty years or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Under-Secretary of State's reply is likely to satisfy my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). It certainly does not satisfy me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman used an extraordinary phrase. He said that he did not want to go too fast. I thought that the hon. Gentleman's party was engaged in getting a great many things done in 100 days. These 100 days are running out. Instead of saying that he is afraid of going too fast the hon. Gentleman should be getting a move on. I should like to know why he is not prepared to confirm the Order which my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was considering at the end of the last Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the right procedure is to confirm the Order, which will deal with existing effluent, and then deal with new effluents under the Bill, rather than leave the position as it is, which is perfectly ridiculous in that effluent from a factory at Bridgeton will be controlled where effluent from a factory in the Gorbals a little farther down river will not be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a false point when he said that he was afraid that this would give the Clyde River Purification Board too much work to do. I do not know whether he has had any communication from the Clyde River Purification Board, but I certainly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
have had. It is very concerned about the situation which is being allowed to develop, and it wants action to be taken. It is because it wants action to be taken that my hon. Friends and I support the Amendment. The hon. Gentleman is wrongly informed if he thinks that the Clyde River Purification Board does not want action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want something done which will enable this river to be cleaned. I ask the Under-Secretary of State to reconsider this matter. Perhaps he can get some advice from his officials about the views of the Clyde River Purification Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very ill of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) to rebuke us about the speed at which we are dealing with the matter. He was in my office for a number of years, and I did not notice any particular speeding up of this matter. It therefore comes ill from him to criticise us for lack of speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument is based, not on speed, but on how we should proceed. If we are as slow as hon. Members opposite were, it is true that this Amendment should be written in the Bill. But we do not intend to be slow. Having inherited this situation, it is better that we should first make the position of the Clyde the same as that of other rivers in respect of which an order has not been made. If hon. Members opposite are anxious about this matter why did not they produce the Order? They had nine months in which to do it, long before we came to office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to proceed in an orderly way. If the Clyde River Purification Board is anxious to have these powers, I am pleased to hear it. We shall therefore have to pursue this matter concerning discharges of existing effluents more expeditiously than we thought. We are now in, I think, the sixtieth day of office, and we have done much more than hon. Members opposite did in sixty months. If the Bill is passed as it stands, we shall be able to proceed in an orderly way in issuing the various orders for controlled waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for Hillhead will look at the map to see the great steps which we are taking in relation to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
the whole coast line of Scotland. If he looks at the 35 areas appended to the map, he will see that we are doing much more in the Bill than hon. Members opposite did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman does not want to be unfair, but he and the Minister of State have made it perfectly clear that they adopted the Bill from us. Not a comma has been altered. Therefore, I do not think he is fair when he says that this is a tremendous new step which he is taking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is really absurd. Hon. Members opposite keep changing the argument every day. I thought that we had agreed that this argument would not be put forward again. I thought that it was made clear on Thursday that no one would further question the parentage of this child. But now the right hon. Gentleman claims that the Bill is his to a comma. As we have pointed out, if the Opposition had been in office they would have dealt with the Bill in this way. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) said at our last meeting that the Amendments produced by the Opposition would have been Government Amendments to the existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got my argument almost right, but I said that we would, on hearing the argument deployed in the Committee, have accepted the Amendments had hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is delightful. If the Clyde Order had been confirmed we would have made reference in the Bill to the Forth and the Solway and the Clyde in trying to adjust the position of one to the other. If the hon. Gentleman reads Clause 8, he will see how difficult it has been to bring everything into sequence. The Clyde would have been mentioned if the Order had been confirmed, but because that is not so we must proceed in this way. To that extent, we have inherited the position of right hon. Members opposite, which we are not proud of. We wish that the Clyde Order had been confirmed, but the responsibility for that rests with the Conservative Party and not with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get back to discussing the cleansing of rivers, because that is what we are all concerned with, rather than make debating points—which naturally appeal to a doctor—about who was the father or mother of the child. We want to get the rivers clean quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced the Bill—and, as I said on Second Reading, I am glad that they have done so—which was to a large extent prepared by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). I still do not understand why the Under-Secretary of State will not accept the Amendment, or why he does not confirm the Order and therefore put the Clyde in the same position as the Forth. I should have thought that it was sensible to do one or other of those things. If the hon. Gentleman will not do that, will he say how long it will take to get the Clyde in the same position as the Forth so that we may have some idea about the progress which may be made? I want the hon. Member to accept the Amendment or, if he cannot do so, to explain why, and to confirm the Order. If he feels that he cannot do that—and there may be difficulties of timing—will he tell us how he expects that we shall get the Clyde procedural position into that which exists for the Forth at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said when we were discussing the question of a period of 20 months as opposed to one of 12 months, on certain points we were ready to take into consideration the feelings expressed in the Committee and, on a sensible point like that, not to stick to the letter of the original draft of the Bill. My hon. Friends have argued, I think extremely clearly and effectively, about the position of the Clyde. As I understood from the speech of one of the Ministers on Second Reading, the procedure envisaged in the Bill for the Clyde had been adopted because those responsible for the Clyde estuary might have to go through two stages very quickly. For example, if the Order had gone through just before the Bill became an Act, within only a few months they might have had to consider the second stage, that of the pre-1951 discharges. I understand that point on procedure, and I see that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
various difficulties might arise in dealing with the two stages—the new and altered discharges and the previous discharges—at such a short interval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the point which my hon. Friends have stressed is that there should be no delay, and I entirely support them on that. We want to hear the hon. Member say that the first stage for the Clyde, which would be carried out by the Order, will happen soon and that the second stage, under the Clause, which can be brought into operation at the discretion of the Secretary of State, will be at a reasonable period after that, and as soon as it is practicable to carry out the second stage. It might be two years, three years or even four or five years, but we should be grateful to him for information about this. I recognise, having studied the Second Reading speeches, that there may be some procedural difficulties. We are keen that, apart from the procedure, there should be no delay in either the first stage or the second stage in the Clyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know from where the Amendment has come. I have confidence that my hon. Friend will consider it on its merits, but it is a bit impertinent on the part of hon. Members opposite to blame my hon. Friends for the delay in this matter. If there is any fault at all, we know where it lies. On Second Reading I mentioned not only this Order but one for the Solway Firth, and I gave the dates which appeared in the Annual Report published by the last Secretary of State during his tenure of office. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) made those remarks. We all know his anxiety. Indeed, we give way to none in our anxiety to see the rivers cleaned up, but it is surprising that he should make those criticisms of the Administration in view of the fact that it took thirteen years and a new Administration to introduce another Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I did not put my point of view in a way which was acceptable to hon. Members opposite. I was pointing out that the Labour Party has said that it is anxious to get a move on, and I am glad to hear it. It has introduced the Bill, but seems to be refusing Amendments and refusing to confirm Orders which would do what hon. Members opposite say they want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
do—get a move on and clean the rivers. That was all I was requesting—that they should live up to their own words. In refusing the Amendment they did not seem to be doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the hon. Member asks that this Administration should do in seven weeks what his right hon. Friends had three years to do—because it is almost three years since that Order was presented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point of clarification which I seek on the Order. The Clause says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may by order direct …"</p></blockquote>
Is this after representation has been made to the Secretary of State by a river purification authority? I want to know that the Order would not be put into operation till the appropriate river purification authority had recommended this action to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, both sides of the Committee appear to be claiming the parentage of the Bill. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said that not a comma had been altered from the original draft. I am the unfortunate person who is looked upon as shocking by some newspapers. There is a reference to Mr. Michael Noble proposing a Measure which many of us have been demanding for years and which has been so promptly introduced by the Labour Government. There is a rather scurrilous attack on myself and on other hon. Members for trying to amend the Measure so to make it more worth while—a Measure which had the general agreement of both sides of the Committee. I should like the parentage of the Bill to be cleared up one way or other so that the public at large are left in no doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that there has been an unfortunate attack on my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Baxter), but if he chooses the wrong company it is not my fault that he gets into difficulty. I do not want to get into an argument about parentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the question of introducing a Bill, and its exact nature, was first discussed in the Scottish Office I raised the specific point about outstanding Orders. The only one is the Clyde. I asked why
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
no Order had been signed before—and that is not a question for the Scottish Office to answer but for the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). As it had not been signed, the question which arose was whether it was fair to lay the Order and then to introduce the Bill. There is a suggestion that there might be some sharp practice in introducing the Bill and then signing the Order, because the inquiry which would allow the Order would be an unfair inquiry since it would be conducted on an entirely different premise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we wanted to sign that Order we should be duty bound to order a new inquiry. I admit that one might get round it with a Philadelphian lawyer, but I feel that such rather smart tactics are rather unfair to the people concerned—in other words, to promote the Order and at the same time to produce the Bill. I am not quite clear whether the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) wants that. If he does, he ought to say so. Having been presented with the situation we decided that it was not fair to proceed with the Order in the light of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the argument which the hon. Member advanced on Second Reading and to which I referred. I see a certain point in it, but he has just said that there was only one Order outstanding. I thought that he informed us earlier that there were another four, including one for Banff, and Moray and Nairn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant in relation to the immediacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is perfectly fair in raising the issue of the Clyde now. It might be arguable if we sought to discuss the other Orders at this stage. That is why no other hon. Member opposite has raised other matters. But the hon. Member is perfectly fair in saying that we should argue about the Clyde now. Nevertheless, I feel that it would be unfair of us to promote the Order under the old provisions and then to proceed to slap on new provisions because we had passed the Bill. I do not know how the Franks Report on tribunals would have envisaged this situation. We are advised that it would be only right and proper in these circumstances to proceed with a new inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
I do not know how long it will take to carry all these matters to fruition, but I can assure hon. Members that it will not take as long as it took under the Conservative Administration. I assure them that we shall do it much more speedily than ever the Conservatives did as a Government, because we believe most profoundly in the purification of our rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get the position of the Clyde in proper perspective. It must be recognised that, if one is to clean the Clyde, the upper reaches are more important than the lower reaches. For all the fouling which has gone on in the lower reaches it must be clearly recognised that it is the upper parts of the river which are important. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Dr. Miller) spoke about this on Second Reading, and he was right. There is a lot to be done in the river. The Bill deals with that. We come to the lower reaches. We have to control the estuary. We can take all this in sequence.

The only thing which I have learned this morning which encourages me a great deal is that the Clyde River Purification Authority is gnawing at the bit and is anxious to go galloping away, They have a good Government this time, not the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>In line 21, leave out "the last foregoing subsection" and insert "subsection (3) of this section".</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion, Mr. Steele, I am delighted to agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of Amendment 72 is that the first line of this subsection should read as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of this Act (other than sections 1 to 3, unless these sections apply by virtue of the foregoing subsection) and of section 28 of the principal Act shall apply to any tidal waters within the seaward limits, specified in Schedule 3 …".</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting Amendment. The tidal waters of the Firth of Forth and the Solway Firth have been subject to Orders under Section 29 of the 1951 Act. These are the waters of the Firth of Forth, which appear at item 19 of Schedule 3, and of the Solway Firth, which appear at items 23 to 28 of that Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By virtue of Clause 8(1) the provisions of these Clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill, which relate to control of existing discharges, apply to these tidal waters of the Forth and Solway. These waters are, however-"controlled waters" under Schedule 3 and, as subsection (2) stands, being controlled waters, they would be excluded from the application of Clauses 1 to 3. In this respect, therefore, subsections (1) and (2) as printed are contradictory. Amendment No. 72 deals with this defect by limiting the exclusion of Clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill to controlled waters which are not already subject to an Order made under Section 29 of the 1951 Act—that is to say, that all waters mentioned in Schedule 3 other than those of the Forth, at item 19, and of the Solway, at items 23 to 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendments No. 73 and No. 74 is to replace Clause 8(4) with a new subsection which provides specifically, as the present subsection does not, that the Secretary of State will have power to make further tidal waters "controlled waters". This was the intention of the present subsection (4),
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
but as drafted it applied all the provisions of Clause 8 some of which, for example, subsection (1), relate to tidal waters which are not controlled waters. The intention is that the Secretary of State may by order make tidal waters not so far covered by the 1951 Act controlled waters under the Bill. New discharges and new or altered outlets into these waters will be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may also include, if he wishes, a provision, made under Clause 8(2), applying Clauses 1 and 3, which bring existing discharges under control, to these newly controlled waters. If he wishes, he can take these steps in two stages. The first would be under the new subsection (3) dealing with new discharges and new or altered outlets and the second under subsection (2) applying control over existing discharges to controlled waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 81 is consequential on Amendments No. 73 and No. 74, and Amendment No. 88 is consequential on Amendment No. 74.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 deals with areas. We have brought along maps for hon. Members to consult. This Amendment deals with adjoining tidal waters. If in the prosecution of any of these offences there arises a matter of argument as to which authority is involved, we intend to employ the simple principle of dividing the area so that if an estuary is polluted, the definition of the responsible authority would try to ensure that it was the board responsible for the origin of the waters which in that respect would be responsible for dealing with the pollution of the estuary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that in the second part of subsection (2) the operative words are
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may by order direct"?</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
Will he confirm that that would bring in what I would call stage 2, that is, existing discharges? My understanding is that that is the operative part of the provision and that is significant in relation to the new subsection (3) which is proposed in Amendment No. 73. Under that new subsection, which replaces the original subsection (4), the Secretary of State may direct that areas of tidal waters other than those which are in the map can be brought within the scope of the Bill and added to Schedule 3, an addition which was not provided in the original Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that the map covers most of the tidal waters where pollution is at present expected, or where it could occur. Would I be right in assuming that the purpose of the new subsection (3) is that if, because of a new industry happily coming to an area along the north-west coast of Scotland, or because of some new community, or for some other similar reason, pollution might be threatened in a new area of tidal waters, the Secretary of State will be able at his own discretion to designate the firth concerned, which while at the moment not in danger of pollution, might need to be designated because of some such change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question is concerned with Amendment No. 75. So far as the hon. Gentleman knows, are the purification authorities able and willing to take on this new responsibility for tidal waters as suggested? Dependent on circumstances, it could be a very great additional responsibility for an authority to find itself dealing with tidal waters and perhaps with large ships and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that, unless we have control all over, this is the only practical way of dealing with the problem, because, whatever the fouling may be, whether by oil or ships' refuse, the deposit would foul the adjoining area under the control of another authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that this was not the best way to deal with it. I was saying that as this was a completely new suggestion, appearing only in the last few days, we should be told whether the authorities had been consulted and whether the hon. Gentleman had obtained their reactions. I agree that this seems to be a most sensible way of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
doing it, provided that the authorities are ready and able to cope. I appreciate that there might be difficulties about deciding which authority should be responsible if more than one was concerned and I agree that the way proposed is probably the only way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the waters concerned are not controlled waters but tidal waters there could be arguments about responsibility for dealing with the discharge. For example, if a pipe were discharged in the sea, it could be argued that that was a discharge at sea rather than an offence under the Bill. What we are doing is to make it clear that even if they are not controlled waters, tidal waters will be within the purification board's remit, so that the board will be able to deal with any of these discharges by including them in its area. I am sorry that we are not also considering Amendment No. 63, in page 9, line 7, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) In the case of a discharge into controlled waters other than a discharge from land or premises, the functions of a river purification authority may, for the purposes of this Act and of Part III of the principal Act, be exercised by any river purification authority whose area is contiguous with the said controlled waters.</p></blockquote>
It is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member says that it should be included—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to suggest that Amendment No. 63 came into this discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is for the convenience of the Committee, I have no objection to its being discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fair point is that we thought very carefully about this very good Amendment suggested by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). My hon. Friend has explained that he could not attend this Committee this morning because he is attending another Committee. We gave that Amendment every consideration and later produced our own version. We were seeking to meet the hon. Gentleman because we did not think that his Amendment went as far as we would like. His Amendment would relate only to a discharge from a ship and we would like to take
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
it a step further and cover all discharges within these tidal waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman refers to discharges other than from a ship, does he include sewage pipes going some distance to sea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Among other things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the Under-Secretary. The Amendment which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and I put down was partly in the nature of a probing Amendment. We did not expect its drafting to be accepted, but we hoped that the point about vessels would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, another issue is now raised. This is the area over which the purification board can take steps to discover whether pollution is being created by discharges from ships and other forms of sewage. It is very difficult to discuss this properly without a map. For example, would it be possible for these authorities to go beyond the areas coloured red on the map which the hon. Gentleman has kindly provided for us? If that is not so, I shall have to consider moving an Amendment at a later stage which would provide for a line roughly speaking from Campbelltown to the head of Loch Ryan, which would mean that the purification board would be able to make inquiries of vessels and other forms of sewage over the whole of the Firth of Clyde. Can the hon. Gentleman enlighten me about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By definition in Section 34(1) of the 1951 Act, "land" includes land covered by water. Because of that, by including a reference to the tidal waters within the authority's area, the Amendment makes the provision as broad as we can get it. These waters are not necessarily controlled waters. This is the point of the Amendment inspired by a good idea and naturally embellished by Government assistance. Without going into the whole paraphernalia of controlled waters, we simply want to provide power in this way. We naturally hope that the hon. Gentleman will be glad to see us proceed with Amendment No. 75 rather than with his own modest Amendment No. 63.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, but the hon. Gentleman has still not answered the question. If there were a vessel causing pollution three miles off the south-east

point of Arran, would the Ayr River Purification Board, for example, be able to do anything about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that what we would do would be to promote an order under the Bill to deal with situations like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
