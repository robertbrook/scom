	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i></p>
	<p>That during the proceedings on the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Willis.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I would also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice of Amendments should be given. As a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(ESTABLISHMENT OF HIGH-LAND DEVELOPMENT BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 5, to leave out "enabling the Highlands and Islands" and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"affording the people resident and those desirous of becoming resident in the Highlands and Islands comparable opportunities of living and advancement to those obtainable elsewhere in this nation, to enable them to develop their own communities and culture and thus".</p></blockquote>
The Clause goes on thereafter to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to play a more effective part in the economic and social development of the nation, there shall be established a Highland Development Board …'.</p></blockquote>
This is an unexceptional Amendment but nevertheless one which makes an extremely important emphasis, an emphasis which we must concentrate on throughout our discussions. The vital word is the word "people". This first Amendment is to make it crystal clear that in our deliberations about the Board and any future Secretary of State who may have responsibility for it the whole object of the setting up of this Board and spending money on Highland development—and I hope that we shall spend a lot—is to transform the region into a productive and thriving community
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
in which men and women of ability can earn as much as they can elsewhere and can envisage a considerable economic future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie) put it this way:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My point is that in the Highlands we have to produce conditions in which the good pupils of Golspie High School, which has the highest percentage of university entrants in Britain, can feel that they can stay here, develop their own country and thrive. At present they do not believe that. They believe that the only road to prosperity is the highway to England or elsewhere. That is a situation that has continued for a long time in the Highlands."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th March 1965; Vol. 708, c. 1138.]</p></blockquote>
It is a situation which has existed too long. I went to Portree High School in Skye and I know how few of those who were with me at that time are now in the Highland area and how many of them would have liked to have had the opportunity to be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, we must all make the basic assumption that there must be a sacrifice on the part of the well-off southern areas. This means a better planned distribution of population and industry and in the long term, therefore, a proper integration of what are loosely described as the remote areas. Is the Bill to hold out any real hope to the peripheral areas? I shall be extremely disappointed if it does not, and so will the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). In the short time that I have been a Member of the House—and I am well aware of my shortcomings in that respect—one of the most frustrating parts of my work has been to try and obtain basic conditions of living for the people of the remote areas—things like electricity, water, roads and wireless communications. I have been disappointed to a degree by the attitude of the present Government, which I hoped would be considerably more humane than the last, if only on pure Socialistic theory, to the remote areas. The previous Government took decision on strict commercial assessments rather than any social consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of enabling the Highlands and Islands to play a more effective part in the economic and social development of the nation…."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
It is frequently said that the Highlands are the playground of the few, and there is much truth in this. There is an equally widely canvassed view that, instead of being the playground of the few, the Highlands should be the playground of the many. It is from this view that I deeply dissent. I want a vision of a new Hebrides, not a new Butlin's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be clearly written into the Bill that the object of the exercise is to provide conditions for people to live and work and advance themselves in the area. There is nothing to prevent any future Secretary of State from saying that here you have a vast area which is half of Scotland and the best way in which it could play the most effective part in the development of the nation is to afford relaxation with national parks and tourist facilities to the uttermost limit for industrial workers of the south. We would then still have a situation in which the able pupils from Golspie High School would have to go south to find opportunities in technology and scientific work and, to a degree, work in the professions. I am certainly not against tourism and there are great opportunities for its further expansion and extension. However, I do not want to see a situation arising in which the Highlands are simply made the playground of the many. This should be emphasised at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disturbed by a letter I received from the Scottish Landowners Federation. This interesting letter more or less said that the Bill was splendid, provided that it was not implemented. It said that the Federation had had discussions with the Minister and urged upon him to be careful and cautious about embarking on schemes of agricultural reclamation. I have a Question on this subject for Written Answer—I am not sure whether it is in order for me to mention this. However, unless the Minister and the Government are to be concerned with agricultural reclamation and industrial growth then the Bill will have failed from the point of view of the people who live and work in the Highland area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Liberal Party publication on the High-lands has said this already and I do not think that I could say it any better. The publication—"Highland Development" is the name of it—says precisely what I and the Liberal Party think should be done:
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"… despite the large sums which are being spent on the Highlands"—</p></blockquote>
and there are large sums being spent—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the great majority of the best pupils from the Highland schools, when they go south to universities and colleges, never come back. There are people who declare that what is our loss is the country's gain, and people speak with pride of the achievement of the Highlander in agriculture and industry and administration in the more fertile land of the South, and in the multi-storied offices of our great cities. What we wish particularly to emphasise is that this is not the case. The benefit to the country as a whole would be much richer if these young people had scope for their talents nearer home. It is also most misleading to claim that the remedy is largely in their hands but that they lack the energy or the will to do anything about it."</p></blockquote>
This is an argument which frequently comes from this side of the Committee, but not my part of it. The publication goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To their great credit, and often to their personal disadvantage, some do stay and contribute richly to the community which they love. But it is quite unrealistic to expect any young man with a family, or with ambition, to sacrifice the chance of betterment in a job in the south for the sake of patriotic attachment to his homeland. He may want to stay, but if faced with the prospect of superior conditions and promotion in Birmingham or London, he will go. And though his departure may benefit him in the short term, we assert that in the long-term it is detrimental to the national welfare, and delays still further the construction of the kind of Scotland and indeed Britain, we as Liberals, would like to see."</p></blockquote>
I am concerned that any future Secretary of State may say that the only proper use which can be made of the Highlands is to develop them for tourism. That I do not want to see this at all. It was during the Second Reading debate that a great deal will depend on the Secretary of State. Secretaries of State are neither infallible nor liable to go on for ever. We are liable to have a different Secretary of State, whether of the same party or another. In these circumstances it seems to me essential to write substantially into the Bill our intentions on in-industrial and agricultural development in the Highlands.

During the Second Reading debate the hon. Member for Perth and East Perth shire (Mr. MacArthur) spoke with passion—a passion I have noticed in Conservative Opposition Members, but which was not there before—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a moment. I am certainly most willing to give him the opportunity to speak which his party is prepared to deny mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He spoke romantically about Glencoe and about a public lavatory at Glenshee and while this may be very necessary, it is of little importance in this Bill and is a Committee point and not something which should be mentioned on Second Reading. We must be determined at the beginning of this Bill that we are concerned with big things and big developments and not talk about small things like public lavatories. We in the Highlands are tired of the dewy-eyed romantic approach. We are—we have to be—a very practical people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and his suggestion that the Board's powers should be enormously widened and that the Board itself should take control of a very large part of the millions of pounds now being spent in the Highlands. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not continue during the rest of the Committee stage with this policy of distortion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) believe that the powers of the Board should be vastly widened and I look forward to a development of that argument later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I have been making is still there. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) who, regrettably, is not here, summed it up on Second Reading. Incidentally, it is possible for Members of the Conservative Party to be absent without affecting the presentation of their argument. He referred to the dotterel bird and the fact that the future of the dotterel bird was in danger. This is probably a most important question for ornithologists, but it is not a matter which should
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
concern the House on Second Reading of the Highland Development Bill. The Bill is concerned with the advancement of the opportunities of Highland people to work and to have the chance of advancement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want in conclusion to emphasise the latter part of the Amendment which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to enable them to develop their own communities and culture".</p></blockquote>
We would be making a great mistake if we sought to make the Highlands a carbon copy of the rest of the country and did not take advantage of the fact that living there already are people who are not so troubled with divorce or with crime, who are deeply religious and who have standards of honesty and integrity which could be a lesson to many of our conurbations. This is something we have to remember and it is an advantage which we must be careful not to crush. Hon. Members may say that if I argue that we should not have a ferry to Skye on a Sunday because the people there do not want it, I am trying to stop the onrushing tide of civilisation. I do not think that the crime rate in London, for example, is a very good advertisement for conurbation civilisation. We have to try to develop new communities in the Highlands using the traditions which already exist. I do not see anything wrong with writing that into the Bill. The Amendment is unexceptional and emphasises a consideration which is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not forget that the present distribution of population and industry throughout the country is purely accidental. Glasgow might have been a remote area if it had not been for the coal and iron and the port. It is an accident of the Industrial Revolution which produced many things which were fine and useful, but which also spawned much which was ugly and inefficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to use this land properly and I look on the Bill as a new and better kind of development imaginatively guided. This is a tremendous opportunity which we must take, and I give the Government every credit for introducing the Bill so early, but they must lay the emphasis on the people in the Highlands, people all the time, their chances and their opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I am speaking for every Member on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
this side of the Committee and most, if not all, hon. Members opposite, when I say how much we sympathise with the Amendment of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), partly because his speech rings a lot of familiar bells which have been clanging around our ears and the ears of many others in this Committee for many years. The fact that he comes newly to these Highland and Island problems—in a Parliamentary sense only, for I know that he has been interested in them for many years—makes it none the less refreshing to have his contributions and his new opinions on the subject. I do not think that there is on this subject a sharp party line, within the Committee, at all events—I shall not talk about the very different actions of the political parties represented opposite when they are in the Highlands. But I do not think that the hon. Member will draw much fire here against this Amendment and against his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would say that, ultimately, even the Bill itself is not so important as the intentions of the Government and of those who are to make it work. This is what is fundamental. Herein lies the hope and, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the danger. It is not so much what the Bill says as what is meant by the Bill. I believe that it was Chesterton who said that it was not so much what the word meant as what one meant by the word; and that applies here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what the hon. Gentleman said it was implicit that only a Minister and Government full of good will towards the Highlands would introduce a Bill like this. On the other hand, if there were, later, to come along a succession of less helpful Secretaries of State to give the general directives for which the Bill provides, directives which were of the wrong character, the whole purpose and intention of the present Government could be frustrated. That might well happen in later years and the hon. Gentleman was quite right to have regard to it. This is an important consideration to have in mind and it becomes important to have things written into the Bill to tie Ministers down to at least the minimum expectations of performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for the purpose of the general discussion of the provisions of the Bill in Committee, the Amendment, while an acceptable 	<i>hors d'oeuvres,</i> is
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
not necessarily a substantial part of the meal, because it is surely already accepted that the Bill deals with people. Surely it is the concern for people which has made the Labour Party consider the whole question of how to develop the Highlands and Islands. Over the years we in the Labour Party have repeatedly fought on this issue and we have advocated greater provision, more generous provision, more effective provision for developing the resources of the Highlands and Islands and raising the standard of life of the people of the Highland and Island communities—not only by developing growth points—and always with the aim of retaining the population's present distribution and helping the small communities which will die if they are not developed. This case has been put year after year over the decades. I have, therefore, every sympathy with the Liberal Party spokesman's argument in this respect. I am sure that it is correct and I know that the hon. Gentleman has put his case with a sincerity which I would not dream of inpugning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is meant by the Bill—and I am sure that the hon. Member will agree—is that we want to give the Highland and Island communities a better chance first to survive, secondly, to develop and, thirdly, to contribute more to the general wealth of the United Kingdom. This is stated in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum and in this Clause. This purpose is solidly in the Bill and it is most important that it should be stated and defined there in this positive and contributing sense, because the Bill assumes a future viable Highlands and Islands. It is implicit in Clause 1 from the very start that the Government's intention is that there will be a Highlands and Islands area which will develop so that its resources will be used to the full so that it will contribute in a bigger and bigger way to the general wealth and welfare of the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are those who take the view that in many respects the contributions have been a one-way traffic. But that is not so. Although great amounts of money are being spent in the Highlands and Islands, as elsewhere throughout the country, when one talks about giving the crofters—that is the wrong expression—investing in crofting,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
we must not forget that we invest vast sums in agriculture generally. Indeed, farming in the home counties and in other prosperous areas benefits from every £100 so spent much more than the agriculturists in the Highlands and Islands, where high freight and transport costs and other factors militate against the crofters and marginal farmers in the full enjoyment of what should be equal benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we hear about the cost of agricultural subsidies for the Highlands and Islands, we should not assume that we enjoy a favourable differential. We have reason to complain against the very adverse differential. Every £100 of assistance which is given to crofting agriculture in the Highlands and Islands is worth a great deal less by the time it reaches the crofters than it is worth in the shires of England or in the more prosperous southern areas of Scotland, so that in the end the crofter gets far less assistance from the nation per acre than any other section of the agricultural community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only that, he has to apply it to the most marginal land, to the least productive land which will produce the most frugal harvest; so that, again, he is up against this difficulty of being wrongly attacked for the amount of subsidies which he gets, while yet receiving far less in far more difficult conditions than any other section of the agricultural community in Great Britain. I have often thought that instead of criticising the crofters who suffer from this adverse differential which is based on an accident of nature, remoteness, geography and the poor quality of the soil, we should be thinking in terms of the need for a positive differential, with special aid being applied to areas which need far greater assistance—areas where there is so much marginal and unproductive land. I know that there are many farmers who would agree with this sort of differential and although I admit that it would be difficult to apply, there is a powerful case for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to fall into the arguments of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) who was castigated for talking about tourist lavatories in that wind blown area of Glenshee. No doubt the more wind blown
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the area is, the more necessary it is to have lavatories, although Highlanders like others can no doubt find means and places around Glenshee to get over the problems of absence of less public lavatories. On the other hand, I do not want to disparage the contributions of a specialist on the subject if he wants to discuss that particular aspect of Highland reconstruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would emphasise to the hon. Member for Inverness that the intention of the Bill is what matters. He has already said that in his mind there is no doubt that the Government's intentions in the Bill are to deal with the solution of the problems of our people in the Highlands and Islands. I agree with him that there are dangers of finding a sort of two-class attitude, an attitude which can even be found within the Highlands themselves with inferior service to the local people. It is here that there can arise certain dangers from an over emphasis on the tourist industry. I will give an example to show what can easily happen. A county councillor, a minister, in North Uist who was going across to the Islands a few months ago. He was on one of MacBrayne's new ferry steamers and he wanted a meal. He was asked if he was a member of MacBrayne's tour, a group of tourists. When he said that he was not, he was told that he would have to wait until the tourists were fed. This is the sort of fearfully snooty and blatant attitude which can be found on the part of MacBrayne's who used to have on their steamers going to and from Stornaway a little brass plate which referred to "passengers and other incumbrances".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger in the over emphasis on tourism—however important in itself. There is gross exaggeration about possible earnings for ordinary crofters and others from seasonal tourism. The retired Chairman of the Crofters Commission fell into this error when he began often at the expense of the dignity of local people; and there is always a danger of undermining that dignity if tourism does not develop along the right lines. The Highlanders do want to be wholly dependent upon tourism. It is not the natural industry of the Highlands. The Highlanders may be naturally hospitable but that does not mean that they are natural waiters—although they have been waiters for far too long in another sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Tourism at the very best is only seasonal and is dependent upon climate and other vicissitudes which are completely outside the scope of planning and beyond the control of the individuals concerned. It can supply never more than a seasonal income, a very small supplementary income, and there is a danger that whole families become involved, husband and wife and children, to tote up four-figure incomes from tourism. After all, we have, in most cases, to divide these incomes by two, three and four. Whole families are often involved. Even in the most prosperous and accessible areas in the Highlands and Islands, tourism is an industry that must be well organised. But it has to be seasonal—climate and weather dictate this—and it can only provide for ordinary people a rather small additional income. It will not solve the general problem of unemployment and depopulation that exists in these parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suffer, after all, in these areas from many economic and social problems. I do not think that the tourist industry or temporary solutions such as public works are by any means a full solution to the problem. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say there is a danger of taking tourism and regarding it as a final and major solution. It has been so regarded by far too many people over the past few years, people of authority and influence and, indeed, in the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often said here—and the hon. Member for Inverness was right in saying again—that the purpose of all of us should be to sustain and assist development of and to foster the growth of existing communities in the Highlands. This is vitally important, every bit as important in its own way as the growth point principle because centralised growth points alone can easily lead to further depopulation of outlying areas which are not themselves so fortunate as to be able to obtain or sustain industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have every sympathy with what the hon. Member for Inverness said. However, I also believe myself that in this Clause there is intended to be a real regard for people as people. I do not know how the Minister feels about this Amendment but I myself should like to see the use of the word "people" in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
first Clause. I do not see any real argument against it and I doubt if there is one. I suggest to the Minister that if the hon. Member for Inverness is agreeable he might have a look at it. The intention of the Bill is clear and, I think, acceptable to all of us. I would think that the hon. Member for Inverness would be happy if his purpose, even if not his actual wording, were written in in terms that sound a little bit more human and are directly applicable to people as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have our purpose, even when clear, stated in the most human and simple terms, not only in economic terms and in terms of development. I think that if we had it written in that there must be especial regard to the people of the Highlands and Islands themselves that would not be a bad thing at all and I think would please everyone in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not quarrel with any of the sentiments expressed by the mover of this Amendment, the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) I realise the importance of these views and it was because of that that we looked at this Amendment very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to avoid in the Bill giving any impression at all that the Highlands are a sort of special area to which the nation has to hand out doles. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) used the right word when he said that we must do nothing to impair the dignity of the people in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are endeavouring to put this into the context of saying that here is an area capable of contributing to the national economy and social development if the problems peculiar to that area are tackled and its own social and economic development undertaken. We wanted in this Bill to get it set in the correct framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the use of the word "people" is concerned the use of the word "social" twice in this Clause implies people. There cannot be social development without people. Social development concerns people's standard of living, their way of life, their various services as a community. When we came to look at this we felt there was a great danger that if we put the words in we would be getting off
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
on the wrong foot. We wanted to create the impression, and I think it is the right attitude, that the Highlands could make themselves an effective contribution. As I understand the Liberal Party policy, this is in fact what it said. The hon. Member will remember his own words—I do not know why he is so modest about his pamphlet on 	<i>Highland Development</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are most alive to the need for social expenditure, but we believe that unless the Authority adopts 'Make the Highlands Pay' as its basic aim, the scheme would be untenable to the public at large."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to develop this particular argument. I do not go all the way, but I do go a considerable way with this, but this is certainly the setting in which we are endavouring to put this conception, namely, our belief that here was part of the country capable of contributing substantially to the economic and social life of the nation and in doing so contributing to its own economic and social life. But we recognise that the area has problems peculiar to itself, and these require to be tackled in ways which might be different from those in the rest of the country. This was our attitude towards it and was the first reason which led us to the opinion that we ought not to accept this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two other points about the Amendment. The first is that I am advised that as it is worded at present it could be read as restrictive in that any contribution which the Board made to development would have to be viewed as a definite contribution to the communities and culture of the Highlands. When one looks at the words themselves they are rather vague. For instance the Amendment says
	<br><blockquote><p>"comparable opportunities of living and advancement to those obtainable elsewhere in this nation".</p></blockquote>
The meaning of this is that somehow there is a different standard of life in the Highlands from that in the rest of the nation. I am not certain that is true. From the fact that we wish to develop other areas of the country it is indicated that we do not think this is so. We do not think that this distinction can be drawn as it is drawn in the Amendment. Because of the vagueness of the wording
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
it begs a number of questions about the standard of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to get them on the right footing and set this against the right background because I am sure that the people in the Highlands themselves wish to be looked at as a people capable of making an effective contribution to the life of the nation as a whole. They do not want to be looked at as a distinct, separate community which has to be given special financial treatment, special doles, in order to keep them living. This is the last impression we wish to create. It would not be true. For these reasons, while we have every sympathy and would not quarrel with what the hon. Member for Inverness said, we feel we should not accept this Amendment. What the hon. Member has said is implied in the first subsection of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not we should try to incorporate the word "people" somehow is something we could look at before Report, but at the moment we feel that the words we have got are the right words. Though I would be prepared to look at it I could not give any undertaking that we shall necessarily find the right answer. We are anxious to obtain the position I have indicated but I am quite prepared to look to see whether the word "people" could be put in somehow in order to give the emphasis for which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness was asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend think a little further on this problem? I agree with a great deal of what he has said. He tells us that the word "social" implies the word "people", and I am prepared to accept that. Am I then to conclude that the word "economic" includes the word "industrial", because that is a most important assumption? It is the case that industry has not played its part in the life of the Highlands as it ought to have done in the past, although we are hoping for better things in future. I would suggest to my hon. Friend the word "industrial" be expressed so we can clearly understand the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the fact that the use of the phrase "comparable opportunities" seems to indicate that opportunities in the Highlands had not been comparable or were not comparable. Is not that one of the issues in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the Bill? Is it not the major issue in the Bill? If opportunities in the Highlands are comparable, why is there this devastating migration of people from the Highlands towards the South? Is it not the case that opportunities are not comparable and that depopulation has been going on despite all we have been trying to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend is missing the point here. There are other areas of the country outside the Highlands also suffering from depopulation. This is part of the Highland problem. We know that. But it also affects other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is repeating what I was saying on Saturday at Galashiels, that the problem of the Highlands is a problem of the Borders. Depopulation is happening in the Borders just as in the Highlands. I am aware of that, but the fact remains that we are dealing in the Bill with the Highlands and we are not concerned with a territory outside the Highlands. So I would suggest to the Minister of State that we might consider at some stage in the Committee proceedings that we should be able to state the sort of outline which all of us expect for the Highlands in the days which lie ahead—what shape the Highlands will take so far as industry is concerned. This is inherent, it lies at the very heart of the little debate we have had this forenoon, on the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister of State will consider this matter, and when he does, will consider it on a somewhat wider basis and let us know definitely in what respect the word "industrial" relates to the word "economic."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great sympathy to the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) because in his Amendment he has touched at the very root of the problem with which this Bill sets out to deal, the problem about people, of depopulation, the fall of population in this area to 280,000 people, or something of the sort. I support the intention of the Bill. I am not sure whether the powers which the Secretary of State proposes to take are necessary or right—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will deal with that when we come to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I say, those are points which we will no doubt be developing later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole content of the Bill rests upon the need to solve the problem of depopulation. As the hon. Member for Inverness says in his Amendment, we seek to afford to the present residents in the Highlands, and to those who wish to come there,
	<br><blockquote><p>"opportunities of living and advancement"</p></blockquote>
which are comparable to those existing in other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the Minister say that he would consider whether there may be a way of introducing the word "people" on Report. It is people who form the root of the problem. I must be careful not to stray from the Amendment, but I suggest that its terms are rather wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the references made to tourism by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will be considered rather unfavourably. If we are going to afford comparable opportunities of living and advancement to the Highlanders, the tourist industry can be developed much more than it is. It can make a very important contribution to Highland economy, not merely for the limited summer season but right through the winter, in the ski-ing areas, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lavatory which incurred the displeasure of the hon. Member for Inverness is simply an indication of the sort of thing in respect of which a contribution to the existing amenities would help to extend the season. We have hardly begun to scratch at the potential which the tourist industry can offer to the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister will consider the question again, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness upon moving, at the outset, an Amendment which goes right to the root of the problem facing the Highlands—even if the Government cannot accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) correctly referred to this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
debate as a short 	<i>hors d'œeuvre.</i> This is what it should be, and what the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) intended it to be—more a medium for making the speech that he would have liked to make during the Second Reading debate than for any other purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two small but important points which I want to raise on the matter, however. I agree with the hon. Member that to turn the Highlands from the "playground of the few"—as it is often inaccurately described—to the playground of the many could do great damage to the Highlands unless it is carefully and properly co-ordinated. I believe that that was the point made by the hon. Member for the Western Isles. Last year alone the tourist industry brought into the Highlands about £100 per head of population. It was an estimated figure of rather over £20 million, which is roughly £100 per head of the population—not an insignificant factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has given one side of the balance sheet. He has said that £100 per head came in. What was the expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously cannot tell the hon. Member exactly what the expenditure was, but on the whole Highlanders are not given to spending more than they get in. We can only assume that they did fairly well out of it. I can speak for many areas in the west when I say that they had a very good season, and that tourism brought employment and prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I led the right hon. Gentleman to the wrong conclusion, but when I spoke about expenditure I meant the money which goes out of Britain in tourism. That is the balancing factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting rather wide of the Amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Steele; you have saved me from trying to calculate something for which I had none of the right figures to enable me to give an accurate answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of the hon. Member for Inverness is that people are important. Everybody realises this, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
whether or not we can write it into the Bill is for the Minister to think about. I am worried when hon. Members use broad, sweeping phrases indicating that they want to see all those children who are educated in Golspie Academy—or High School, or whatever it may be—employed in the area. For many generations we in the Highlands have probably had a higher level of teaching in our small rural schools, and our larger schools in the comparatively large centres of the Highlands, than has been available in any other part of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the need to provide opportunities for some of these children, but I also appreciate the desire which has been expressed by hundreds of thousands of Highlanders in the past to find at least part of their lives in other areas. To suggest that we can provide in Golspie, Dornoch, Oban, Stornaway and other places the sort of job opportunities which should be available for highly trained university people is asking the Committee and the people of Scotland to believe a little too much. I know that we should aim high, but this is aiming a little too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not untypically of the Liberal Party—which loves to have everything both ways if it can—the hon. Member for Inverness, by inference criticised past Governments for having based their arguments about Highland development too much on economics. Yet as the Minister says in his own pamphlet, the Liberals are determined to make the Highlands pay. These are not necessarily conflicting ideas. Every Government—Socialist, Liberal in the last century, probably, and Conservative—have realised that in order to proceed with any Highland development, whether it be in respect of agriculture, tourism, fishing or anything else, a great deal of money has to be pumped into the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The per capita payments have been much higher in the Highlands than anywhere else, although if the question is considered in terms of expenditure per acre a lower figure is arrived at. But we can make the Highlands pay only if, first, we prime the pump liberally, generously and wisely and, secondly, if we can persuade the Highlanders—and this is a serious task—that the Highlands is a place in which they should stay and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
make their livings. This object cannot be achieved by money alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) told us that he had been speaking in Galashiels at the weekend. He told us that the problem of the Borders and of the Highlands was the same. He is not correct. His visits to Galashiels may have been too short to enable him to get at the real facts, but the problem in most of the Highlands, as the hon. Member for the Western Isles will know as well as I do, is to create enough jobs to keep people working in the area. The problem of the Borders is exactly the reverse. Many factories in the Borders want to expand, but because the labour is not available for them to expand where they are they are having to do so in Dunfermline and many other areas outside.

It may be that they both have the problem of depopulation, but its basic causes are totally different. This is why, in considering the problems of different areas—Cornwall, Wales, the Highlands, the Borders and bits of Cumberland—we have to remember that each has its own problems and that we cannot generalise and speak about comparable opportunities, as the Amendment does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is exaggerating what I said. I said that the Borders have the same problem as the Highlands, namely, depopulation. I did not go on to deal with the causes because I thought that that would be out or order. The fact is that employers in the Border areas are paying cheap money to women, thereby driving out the men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman gave way to me on the point. It is cheap labour for women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said as much as I want to about this element of the short 	<i>hors d'oeuvre.</i> I finish by saying one word about the Highlands developing
	<br><blockquote><p>"their own communities and culture."</p></blockquote>
I have lived for practically all of my life in the Highlands and I have met a great many young people who have stayed there. I have also met many who have moved to London or Birmingham, or who have gone abroad. I ask the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Committee not to think purely in terms of the traditional culture and way of life of the Highlands, because at times this has been the very factor which has helped to cause depopulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, people are not prepared to live in the same way as their parents and grandparents lived. It is up to us to try to create, with the help of the young people in the Highlands, the right sort of culture. I do not want Beatle records to be played all over the Highlands, nor do I want to hear bagpipes being played the whole time. Our proceedings might occasionally be improved by the skirl of the pipes, and certainly by a Beatle record, but this is not the problem that we have to think about in respect of the Highlands. We must get the young people to work out their own type of culture in the Highlands—the sort of culture which will persuade them to stay there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his very reasonable and sympathetic hearing of the Amendment. I find myself in agreement with many of the things which have been said, but it is clear that some misunderstanding has arisen. This is particularly true of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). I admit that the wording of the Amendment might not be what it should. I am not one of those experts in the Scottish Office who draft Amendments so successfully though occasionally rather dryly. I am prepared to admit that the wording of the Amendment may be such as not to make it acceptable. Nevertheless, if the Minister would be prepared to look at the matter again, particularly in the light of the suggested insertion of the word "people" by the hon. Member for the Western Isles, the point might be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the Minister said, that the word "social" is mentioned twice in the Clause, in the first subsection, where it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the economic and social development of the nation"</p></blockquote>
and later to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands".</p></blockquote>
That is fair enough. I have emphasised, in support of the Amendment, that to a Secretary of State and a Government the social development of the nation might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
well mean using the Highlands as a sort of tourist preserve, which I do not want to see happen. It might be argued, for example, that the nation would benefit from the social point of view if that were done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the right hon. Member for Argyll that when I talked about tradition and so on I was not suggesting that people should live in exactly the same way as their grandparents lived. I was indicating that we should attempt to avoid the area becoming a carbon copy of the South; that we should take advantage of the traditions and way of life which already exist in the area. We should not sweep all these things aside too easily. I did not say, and I could not conceive of a position in which, all the children who go to high school there would be able to go into scientific work in those areas. Nevertheless, we should at least hope that some of them will be able to do so and I do not see why some of the new synthetic industries, for example, could not go north to the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain view is evident in different parts of the Committee and in different parts of the country. They say, "Let us not bring industry to the Highlands and Islands because it is such a great area of peace. Let us keep it as peaceful as we possibly can, except when the tourists come"—and they come intermittently, as the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) pointed out, depending on climatic and weather conditions. Depopulation cannot be arrested till we supply work for the residents. Obviously one is not asking for doles, I entirely agree with the Minister. And since the right hon. Member for Argyll accused me of wanting the best of both worlds at once, I remind him that we are speaking of an area which is run down and which for a specified period should be subsidised, if one wishes to use that word, or even given a dole, if one prefers that word. I prefer the phrase of the hon. Member for the Western Isles, when he said that we should "invest for a time" and then have the expectation of a return in supporting such things as uneconomic transport groups, which would give a return on the investment in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman develop his thinking on this matter? Because what he said was—whether or not he meant it I do not know—that the policies of former Governments towards the Highlands had been far too much judged by economics. I am not certain that that is a pleasant general phrase, but since he mentioned transport a moment ago I am sure that he is aware that Governments have for a long time been heavily subsidising Highland routes and that practically everything else of this sort in the Highlands has been done at considerably greater cost to the taxpayer than when such projects have been undertaken elsewhere. What is the basis of his criticism of past policies in this respect? It seems a little curious that he should be talking about things being judged on economic terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to go out of order, but briefly to reply to that point, surely the reason why we have the Bill is because we have had things like the Beeching Report, which was only stopped because of the great growl of anger which went up in the Highland areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned subsidising uneconomic transport routes to give an example. That sort of thing could be done for a period of time, but it must be done in conjunction with a positive policy which includes the injection of industry and which links the temporarily subsidised aspects—transport, for example—with a co-ordinated overall look at industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay the Committee. I was interested to hear the Minister say that he would be prepared to consider the question of "people" again to make it clear that what both he and I mean is quite definitely understood for the future. If he is prepared to do that I am prepared to withdraw the Amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, to leave out "Highland" and to insert "Highlands and Islands".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Schedule 2, page 13, line 21, leave out "Highland" and insert "Highlands and Islands".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a sensible and convenient course to take, Mr. Steele, since they are all on the same topic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust and imagine that the Minister of State has done me the courtesy, not only of reading these Amendments, but of trying to get behind them, to the points involved, and will have seen at what I am aiming. There are two reasons or arguments which could, I suppose, be used against the Amendments. One is that the title of the Bill—a matter which we are not at present discussing—is generally regarded as comprehensive, and that it is tidier than a longer one. But, if we talk about Highland development and a Highland Development Board we should also realise that we have precedents in previous legislation in which "Highlands and Islands" has been used. We have the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act, and numerous old Highlands and Islands Acts. This has been traditional and I do not know why a departure has been made on this occasion. The only other argument against my wording, "Highlands and Islands" might be that it should be "Islands and Highlands". That would be a sound view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had someone suggested that, instead of "Highlands and Islands" in relation to the Highland Development Bill and the Board, it should be "Islands and Highlands" I would have accepted such a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
suggestion eagerly. However, I was afraid—and rightly it seems—that an Amendment of that type would not be tabled by anyone else and, as the representative wholly of Islands, I thought that I should table one. Having mentioned that there are precedents for using "Highlands and Islands" for bodies of this sort and in other legislation, I do not deny that there may be exceptions. I have not taken the trouble to look up all the statutes to see whether there have been exceptions in the usage of this form of language. That is not so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immediately one departs from the actual headings in the Bill—the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill—one finds many references to "Highlands and Islands". This goes right through the Bill and the Schedules. After all, the purpose of the Bill as set out in Clause 1 states that it is designed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of enabling the Highlands and Islands to play a more effective part in the economic and social development of the nation …"</p></blockquote>
Indeed, throughout the Bill we find the use of the phrase "Highlands and Islands". For that reason I am anxious to know why the change has been made in subsection (1), where it refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a Highland Development Board (in this Act referred to as 'the Board')".</p></blockquote>
Does the change represent a certain attitude on the part of the Scottish Office, or the Government? Perhaps I am too suspicious about the matter; but I must ask whether it represents a departure of any real significance. If not, why was an oversight of this sort permitted, if it was an oversight? If not, what was it? I suppose it is conceivable that some people might suspect that something of special difficulty is being written off here; that there is some underlying wish to shed responsibility in respect of the most difficult places and problems which the Board will have to tackle. I refer, of course, to the problems and areas of the Islands. Or is it that some sort of Freudian blackout has affected the Scottish Office and those concerned in the drafting of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a perfectly simple and rational explanation for the omission and change; but it is important that we should get the matter right. Looking at it superficially, if an English tourist went to the Highlands for the first time—or if, to use
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
the much-worn Martian example, a Martian were to be parachuted into the Highlands for some reason or other—and got hold of a copy of the Bill, he would see the reference to the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill and the Highland Development Board and not have the faintest clue to the Islands' existence or the existence of the provision made for them later in the Bill. At first sight he would not know the Bill affected the Western Isles, Zetland, Orkney, a great part of the County of Argyll and many parts of the County of Inverness-shire. It seems most odd to delete this reference to this large area of the Highlands-Islands region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed that the National Farmers' Union was quick to pick up this point, for commenting on it in its submission of 19th March, which I think all hon. Members have received, it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be the Development Board for the Islands and Highlands. We are anxious that the people there should know that the Board's sphere of operation includes the Islands. That should be made clear in the name of the Board."</p></blockquote>
I agree that the title "Development Board for the Islands and Highlands" would be the better of the two. But I would be happy if the Minister would at least concede the title "Highlands and Islands Development Board". I said "Islands and Highlands" in the first place because I believe that the most important task which the Board will have to perform is in the areas of heaviest depopulation, that is, the Islands. These areas have suffered the longest and speed, based on need, in solving their problems is vital if we are to catch up at last and prevent further depopulation. Urgency is of vital importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the rate of depopulation in, for example, the Island of Barrow. Between 1951 and 1961, between the two Census years, depopulation was running at the rate of about 23 per cent. The figures for the remaining population are largely sustained because people are living a little longer owing to the health and social welfare services which they have today. However, not only is the population declining but it is ageing at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister looks at the school figures in Barra he will see, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
example that at the main school of Castle Bay the school population has continued to decline at roughly the same rate as the general decline in population between 1951 and 1961. This decline in the school population is probably the most serious of all. If he looks at areas in Lewis and Harris and other parts of the Outer Hebrides he will see that one school after another is being reduced in status, that their numbers are declining and that schools which once had several teachers have been reduced to one-teacher status. These are in areas which once had quite large populations, not so many years ago, and where there was active crofting and other activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention the Islands as having particularly serious problems, although I do not forget the other areas with which the Bill is concerned. I cite the problems of the Islands because I consider them to be among the most afflicted areas. They are, without doubt, in the most urgent need of help. Thus, the Amendment is based on the needs of these areas and the fact that they have been areas which, in general, have had the least attention paid to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) talked about the cost of development in the Islands and Highlands. He must have forgotten the fact that delay is one of the main factors here and that this applies particularly to things like civil engineering jobs. There are many reasons for the higher per capita expenditure he spoke about, in the Highlands and Islands, including the difficulty of transport and the many years of neglect which have sent costs soaring while the population has been decaying. If projects in the Highlands are left for very long, then they are bound to cost more. It is extremely odd for the late Secretary of State to talk about the high per capita expenditure when the guilt lies so largely at his own Government's door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is getting rather wide of this Amendment, which is really very narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Steele. The problems of the Islands are so serious that they should be in the very front window of the Bill. If this Amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
is very narrow, that is an argument in favour of it and I hope the Minister will agree to it. This Amendment has, however, a psychological significance for the men and women of the Islands, and the National Farmers' Union in the area have sent out a circular with this point included in their criticism of the Bill. If the Amendment is accepted it will please not only members of the National Farmers' Union but will have a strong psychological impact in the Island areas. The Western Isles Labour Party and the Islands Crofters Union all are agreed on this point also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my submission this should be called a Highlands and Islands Bill and the Board, a Highlands and Islands Board; and every reference to Highlands should also carry the word "Islands". The experience of the Islands is that they have always gone to the back of the queue. Inevitably problems and actual development have been considered from the centre and the tendency has been to plan and develop centrally. We should now look at them from the periphery, that is to say the Islands and work from there. Although it is usually easier and more conducive to tidy administration and planning to tackle problems from and at the centre, these problems should also be looked at from the Island and development in the island areas tackled with high priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is a great deal that the Minister can find to resist and I hope he will support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might help by stating our views about this. We selected the title Highland Development Board because we felt that this was crisp, and even if we included the word "Islands" the Board would become known as the Highland Development Board. We thought the Bill made it quite clear that the Board would be concerned with the Islands as well as the Highlands. This is made clear throughout the Bill, as my hon. Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I appreciate the fact that a number of people have been concerned about the title and wish to have the words "and Islands" in the title. During our consultations in the north this point was made by some of the constituents of my hon. Friend, and since then we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
had the representations from the National Farmers' Union. This is not an Amendment which we feel inclined to resist, and we are quite willing to accept any decision of the Committee. This is not a matter about which we feel strongly, although personally I think the present title is much more crisp and more easily handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the feelings which exist in some parts that the Islands may be overlooked and not brought to the attention of the Board if the word is not included, and their inclusion will bring psychological satisfaction. For that reason we are prepared to accept the Committee's decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like briefly to support the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). The Minister in his brief remarks met the vital question with which the hon. Member for the Western Isles was concerned, and that is the question of emphasis. This will make it clear that the Board is concerned not only with the development of the better off areas but will take real regard to the problems of the Islands about which we were talking earlier. I was pleased that the Minister said that the Government would leave this decision to the Committee, which, I am sure, will be in favour of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend is taking a wise decision. He has met the point about the political integrity of the Western Isles and there is also the geographical integrity. These aspects should be recognised in the title for the reasons which my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) gave—here and during Second Reading—when it was clearly stated that depopulation in the Western Isles had been much heavier and more dangerous in its effect than the depopulation from any other part of the Highlands simply because the Western Isles are isolated. The Minister has taken the right decision and I congratulate him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. A. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel strongly about this. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has made a point of substance and he has been supported by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). On the other hand, I find myself in support of the Minister, and it is so rare that I do so that it is worth putting on record. I agree that the present title has a crispness. I think that names do matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This title is not new nor has it recently been thought out. It is one which has been discussed and in the records of the Liberal Party for many years, so the hon. Gentleman has claimed. It was the one referred to by the Royal Commission on Scottish affairs in 1953 and it is certainly a title which has become well known to everyone in Scotland. I prefer the present title, but if it is thought that the suggestion will have a psychological effect, I am perfectly prepared to bow to those who know more about the psychology of the Highlands and Islanders than a southerner could possibly hope to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one thing of which I am certain. If the Board is called the Highlands and Islands Development Board or the Islands and Highlands Development Board it will continue to be known as the Highland Development Board. Perhaps the Minister could tell us, if islands are included, is it entirely certain which islands they will be? There is a later Amendment which seeks to extend the scope of this Bill and one which I understand would allow the neighbourhood of Galloway to be included. If I could persuade the Minister to extend the Bill, and I do not intend to try, what is the position of other islands such as May? We have learnt in the past how important it is for our wording to be accurate, and the Minister of State has at many Sittings been concerned with the achievement of accuracy. If the Committee desire that the islands be included, is it clear to everyone what islands are referred to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Firzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to differ a little from my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) who tried to muddle up the Minister. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will include the islands. I have an interest to declare which will be obvious from the Notice Paper. The islands are up against the special problems which I hope to expatiate upon a little later. For this reason I certainly welcome the Amendment, and I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
extremely glad that the Minister has accepted it, because I think it has serious implications which will not be lost on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to thank my hon. Friend for his willingness to accept this Amendment even if it does become known in practice as the Highland Development Act and Board. I once had the honour of being Chairman of the Government Advisory Panel on the Highlands and Islands, and the same thing happened and everyone knew it as the Highland Panel. However, acceptance of the Amendment will help to satisfy us on these points in the Highlands and Islands. I do not think, as suggested, that its scope will bring in Arran, Bute and the Isle of Man. There is no real confusion as to the limits of the area hitherto. I cannot imagine MacBrayne's steamers by mistake discharging their disconsolate tourists or other passengers on the Isle of Man instead of Stornoway. It has not happened in the past and we need not be concerned about that. Although this Amendment may not look much, it is of considerable psychological value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose is to try to get away from the habit, which has grown up over many years, of classifying as the Highlands the seven crofting counties which have been known as the seven crofting counties for a long time and which before that were known as the congested areas. People are apt to regard these and only these counties as the Highlands. There may be some reason for that, but it seems to be clearly historical, and it may be worth the Committee's while
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
for a few minutes to consider what constitutes the Highlands for the purposes envisaged in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to find what is common to all the areas which the Government intend to improve. We have references already this morning to Highland culture and way of life. Presumably by that is meant Celtic culture and way of life and that is by no means universal throughout the area of the southern counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The classification of the seven counties may have grown up as a result of the prevalence of crofting in the area, but crofting is by no means universal throughout the area because, as was shown in the recent excellent publication of the Scottish Office, "Land Use in the Highlands", only part of the Highlands in the southern crofting counties is predominantly devoted to the traditional west Highland crofting. I am informed that there are more crofts in the sense of small farms in the County of Aberdeen than in the rest of the Highlands put together. So that it is not crofting which is common to the whole area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depopulation is another factor mentioned this morning, but that is by no means confined to these seven counties. Depopulation, drifting away, takes place in many other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is then the possibility of overpopulation in an area where, although the population is very small or sparse, there are too many people in one part. It may have been that which brought about the extraordinary title of the congested areas in the latter part of the last century. Certainly, in some parts of the Highlands there were too many people for the land to be able to carry them. That is not confined to the seven counties, and we have to look further to find what is meant by the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing common to all these counties and to a good deal more of Scotland is the difficulty of communication for geographical reasons. This is common throughout the Highlands and Islands. It cannot be said that it is the mountainous character of the area, because some of the Islands, particularly Orkney, are as flat as a pancake. It is not the mountainous nature of the country which is necessarily the criterion but
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
whether, because of the presence of water or mountains throughout the area, communications are difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may now be getting to the root of the problem, for difficult communications and consequent remoteness make a special case for special treatment for a certain area of Scotland. It is this that we have to consider. The Secretary of State has understood this in drafting the Bill by referring to such other areas of Scotland as, having regard for their character, he may designate as being included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in what seems to be a very fair attempt to achieve a definition, he should give rather more thought to this consideration and get away from our old legacy of the last century of classifying the Highlands and Islands as the seven counties, because there are other parts of Scotland—I do not necessarily say that they should be included in the Bill—which come within that definition. Strictly speaking, they may not be in proximity to these counties, but they may have a similar community of interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must mention Aberdeenshire, part of which I represent. Certain parts of Aberdeenshire are in much the same condition as parts of the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), in line 17, leave out "Scotland" and insert:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very convenient, Mr. Steele, and will allow me to develop my argument rather more widely than I had expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain parts of Aberdeenshire, the character of the country is similar to that of adjoining parts of Inverness-shire—remote and with difficult communica-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
tions. The climate is difficult and the conditions of life are very similar to Inverness-shire. It is an accident of geography rather than of history that the two areas are so much divorced from each other. As the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) knows very well, some 200 years ago there was a proposal to link the two areas by road. This proposal has now been revived and we hope that the road will be built in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to consider these problems not as they are defined by county boundaries, but by the character of the country. The construction of the road in which the hon. Member for Inverness and I are interested and which would link these two areas is a national problem which does not concern only one county but the Highlands properly so called. Such a project would take place partly within and partly outwith these counties and would greatly help in the development of the Highlands, which is the main object of the Bill. That road would link Aberdeen with Oban and Fort William. The Highlands must be considered as a whole and not as circumscribed by county boundaries, which are often completely artificial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter which requires a great deal of careful study. Far be it from me to suggest for a moment that the whole of Aberdeenshire should be included, but it seems to me as a result of study that a much better definition of the Highlands area could be obtained. I think that it is common knowledge that studies are in progress in the Scottish Office into the problems of the Highlands areas, and there would be more flexibility, and the hands of Ministers would be eased, if the names of these counties were dropped from the Clause, so that we did not give the entirely wrong impression of singling out these counties. The Minister would then have a more rational definition of the Highlands after the studies now in progress had been completed and the results made known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) in the general purpose of his Amendment, which is to extend the area covered by
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
the Bill to other areas with similar problems and linked by other factors. One of the problems mentioned by my hon. Friend is that of the difficulties of communication for geographical reasons. That certainly applies to the area with which I am most concerned, the County of Bute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State recognised, as does the Bill, that the problems of the crofter counties are shared by other areas, and I have no hesitation in saying that this is true of the islands which make up the county of Bute. I take the Minister's acceptance of the earlier Amendment as a happy omen for my Amendment which we are now considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important fact about the three larger islands which go to make up the County of Bute is that they are islands. They are also adjacent, which should bring them within the Clause, and, at the narrowest of the Kyles, Bute is only a quarter of a mile from the mainland of Argyll, and Arran is not all that far from Kintyre. For what it is worth, geologically they are akin to Argyllshire and there are strong cultural links between the islands. One hundred years or so ago, Gaelic was largely spoken in Arran.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big problem which Bute shares with the crofting countries is the difficulty of communication. This has been largely overcome for Bute by the ferry and is being overcome by the improvement of the road to Colintraive. I am encouraged by the news that the Under-Secretary is shortly to visit Colintraive to see for himself conditions there, although he probably knows them fairly well already, with a view to building a bridge. This is something which my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and I have been discussing for some time and I hope that it is a project with which the Government will decide to proceed. It would certainly make a great deal of difference and give a good return in trade, industry, tourism and agriculture. However, there is no question of a bridge in the foreseeable future to link either Arran or Millport or Cumbrae to the mainland, and they have very serious problems of communication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These problems are obvious because it costs £4 5s. a ton to bring feeding-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
stuffs to Arran, a price which has risen by 5s. within the last few weeks. The other way round, it costs farmers in Arran a great deal to take their beasts to the mainland. It now costs 28s. 3d. to take a small calf from Brodick to Kilmarnock and only a few months ago that price was 14s. 1d. so that it has more than doubled. Farmers in Arran labour under great disability and great handicap in this respect. In so far as they send their beasts to the mainland and see them they have a very difficult decision. If the price is not right they have to decide whether to bring them back and incur the heavy freight charge. They are in the same sort of position as farmers in the crofting counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point in common that Buteshire, particularly Arran, has with the remaining parts of the crofting counties and that is the problem of education. I have been going on at my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll for a number of years about a senior secondary school for Arran. It is by no means an easy problem. There are arguments from a number of angles but I have thought that with the help of the Education Department and also the Bute education authority we might be getting towards a workable compromise scheme. The difficulty of getting proper education for their children has been a contributory reason for a lot of people leaving the Island. That is again one of the reasons, like the difficulty of communication, freighting, and the supply of any viable industry in the islands, which gives the whole County of Bute something in common with the crofting counties, and also is the cause of the relatively high rate of unemployment which still persists, anyhow on the Island of Bute, in spite of the quite successful working of the Local Employment Act there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big problem in the whole county, in all three islands which make up the county, is depopulation. Over the last ten years the population of the three islands has gone down by about 25 per cent. About 5,000 people have left the islands in the last dozen years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point of similarity between Buteshire and the crofting counties and that is the proportion of
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
small farms in the county. Some 44 per cent. of the family-run farms do not employ hired labour full time. I think I am right in saying that it is the second highest percentage in Scotland. There are also some designated crofts, smallholdings, which are very similar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Member say how many designated crofts are in Bute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not been able to ascertain. Does the hon. Member mean in Bute or in the county?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Island.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there are any crofts in the Island. I think the crofts are all in Arran. The point is that small farmers are very small in many ways and similar to the actual crofters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point about the fishing industry. There is a strong feeling in Bute and Arran and Cumbrae, throughout the county, which has been shown by the unanimous resolution of the county council, which I was careful to consult on this matter recently. It is also typified by two interesting leading articles in the 	<i>Buteman,</i> which I recommend to the Minister if he has not read them already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong feeling in the county of Bute that because of the problems shared with the crofting counties they should also share the benefits already enjoyed by the crofting counties. For that reason they should be included in the areas covered by this Bill, and their inclusion should serve as a justification for the extension to Bute of the existing advantages enjoyed by the crofting counties and also as a precedent for the extension to Bute of any future legislation which might bring benefit to the crofting counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some talk today of the position on economic grants. The Minister spoke of not wishing to give anything in the nature of charity or a dole to the Highlands. That applies equally to Bute, but I do feel that any financial or economic help given in this context will prove a very sound investment in future. I believe that the sort of help which the crofting counties are getting already, assuming that this Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
will fulfil the purpose stated in the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum …</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member say for the enlightenment of the Committee exactly what advantages now being enjoyed by the crofting counties in the Highlands and Islands he wants to have for other areas? Would he say what exceptional advantages they receive whether in agriculture or otherwise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give one or two examples. There are subsidies for freight and for steamers; the new vehicle ferries, which to some extent are paid for from public funds; there is some subsidised building which we could certainly do with in our three islands; and there are grants and loans to crofts for building, and these certainly could be very useful in Arran. Those are just a few instances. If we had those advantages, plus anything which may come out of this Bill, and anything which may come in future from the Government, they would prove a very valuable investment indeed. I also think that the hon. Gentleman who was lucky enough to get his Amendment, accepted should really not be such a dog in the manger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be prepared to support the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) in so far as he puts up a case for the Island of Arran. I believe it comes within the function of the Board to add to its control whatever areas it feels are necessary for its purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not support him with regard to Bute and Cumbrae. On Bute we have quite a flourishing town that houses a good population and attracts a reasonable number of people from the area around but, in addition to that, as the hon. and gallant Member has conceded, in Bute there are no crofters at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumbrae has an important and thriving town and a considerable population who travel to work in Glasgow and reside in Millport. There are points where we must draw the line. I agree that it might help the hon. Member's case more if he looked to that part of the Firth where there is an island which, in my view, not only requires help from an outside body, and also gets it in a number of ways, but has done so for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
In every sense the Island of Arran is a crofting island. There are only four, large farms on the island and one of these is solely sheep, which is run very successfully indeed. Every other farm on the island is designated as a croft and has all the advantages or disadvantages which fall to the person who operates a crofters' farm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely interested in this argument, because Bute and Arran being very close to Argyll I met a great many people from those areas. We are jealous of the points which my hon. Friend made about the advantages they get, and there are one or two others. I am trying to find out why the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow Govan (Mr. Rankin) wants to distinguish Bute, which is even closer to the coast of Argyll than Arran. He talked about Rothesay but there is little basically different between Rothesay and Dunoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says that crofters on the Island of Arran enjoy the same advantages and disadvantages as crofters elsewhere. They certainly enjoy the same disadvantages as crofters elsewhere but do they really enjoy the same advantages as crofters elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have to make some comparison in conditions of crofters, at the south end of the island particularly, as far as I could ascertain, they did not seem to me, as an outsider, to be basically different or any less disadvantageous. I do not mind giving way for a series of interruptions. It reminds me that I heard last night of a cure for the hiccoughs. That is a story I would not like to repeat to a Committee which consists almost solely of men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship of Rothesay to Bute is not the same as the relationship of Dunoon to Argyll. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) knows that Dunoon is a more flourishing town. There are no Americans at Rothesay. My right hon. Friends could help by getting a Polaris or two to Rothesay Bay. Why he never tried it I do not know. But if he wanted to help Rothesay I do not know why he did not also try to help Dunoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rothesay asked for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the territorial sense alone the relationship of Dunoon to Argyll is certainly not the relationship of Rothesay to Bute. If we are going to draw a line between crofting counties and non-crofting counties it ought to be drawn on the Clyde, between Bute, Cumbrae and Arran. As for nearness or propinquity—if that is the right word—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Proximity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—that is better—proximity. As for proximity to Argyll, if that establishes a claim, well and good. It is the first time it has been established. Whether swimming to Carradale is farther than swimming through the Kyles to Dunoon I do not know. I have not tried either. Perhaps the hon. Member has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we are considering that part of the Clyde the claim goes to Arran, because it has a widespread crofting community, it has continuing depopulation, and a serious lack of education for its children. Quite off the record, Bute has acted in a very selfish manner. I hope the right hon. Gentleman agrees. I know Arran well. I know many of its people. It has been my holiday home for many years. I have tried to do what I could to help it, apart from interfering with the Parliamentary work of any Member at any time. I think the people realise that, and expect me to say a word on their behalf. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider Arran's claim to be treated as a crofting county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the Minister's position. It is always extremely difficult to draw a line. Any line is arbitrary. It was a brave thing to write into the Bill a provision that the area could be extended according to the character, proximity and suitability of other areas. The purpose of the Amendment is purely to limit any such extension to contiguous areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says that he wishes to clarify the matter, but he has left out one county which is encircled by those he has mentioned, namely Mearns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell you that it was intended that Mearns should be included. Do you object, Mr. Steele?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to anything, except that I hope the hon. Member will address the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Steele.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment is to confine the extension to what may be described as contiguous areas. Regional studies are in train, but if we were to extend the argument embarked upon by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), who was talking about the Isles, and who asked what was to prevent us talking about the Isle of Man—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Isle of May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to prevent our extending this provision over a wide area of Scotland, if you are so inclined—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel inclined to do anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government were so inclined they could do so. The word "proximity" can be argued about for a long time. We ought to define more clearly the area which we are considering. As the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) pointed out, areas in Aberdeenshire are very similar to those in the crofting counties. Similarly, the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) has made out a strong case for his area. It is not possible for us in Committee this morning to decide which extra areas will be taken in, but it would not be a bad thing for us to place a restriction on the possible areas to be brought in, because the area which will be covered by the Development Board is already a very large one. Many areas may wish to get in on the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am in the same difficulty in assessing this Amendment as is the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). Hon. Members opposite have forgotten that the Bill already covers roughly half of Scotland. The administrative problems within that large area are by no means inconsiderable, and within that again we have other problems of such a character that they will require the fullest attention of the best people all the time, with the greatest amount of financial assistance that can be given to them in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
form of initial investment, if we are to get the hoped for results from increasing production and prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry if I sound exclusive, just when the Tory Carlton Club has started to be inclusive instead of exclusive. I have never known such a rush to get under the umbrella of the crofting definition since Harold Macmillan married the daughter of the Duchess of Devonshire. It is extraordinary to see this sudden rush to be classified as crofters. It is nowadays a good thing. It is quite fashionable. At least one other Tory ex-Minister took pride in being descended from a crofter when he fought in the Western Isles, but when he was fighting elsewhere he forgot that qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not, however, sure that all hon. Members opposite were addressing themselves to the right arguments. If I remember rightly, the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), or his immediate predecessor at the Scottish Office, replied to Questions which I put on the Order Paper to clarify the position regarding the help given to crofters and crofting areas. I do not want to go over these matters in detail; but for nearly every £10 or every £100 of subsidy, grant or loan which is given for agricultural or associated purposes to a crofter, everybody else in agriculture elsewhere is enjoying a similar subsidy or aid and is getting better value for his money from it. Those in the crofting areas receive considerably less real value because of the costs created by difficulties of remoteness, transport, communications, and the rest. Hon. Members should not imagine that their constituents will suddenly benefit substantially just because they are classified as or with crofters. The foundation of that argument falls to the ground when one studies some of the conditions under which crofters have to labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) who spoke so convincingly about the difficulties of Arran, Bute and Cumbrae, that the position of Benbecula or other outer Islands in this regard is even worse. What is being applied is only the principle of equalisation, because these areas have specially difficult conditions or are more distant from the centres than are other areas he mentioned. They are no more
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
capable—much less, indeed—than Bute of sustaining services based on accumulated local capital. Therefore it is recognised that in regard to these special difficulties something must be done to equalise their conditions in order to bring them anywhere nearly up to the standard enjoyed elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Member's argument about agricultural subsidies. Is he telling the Committee that there are no extra advantages to the crofter from the crofting legislation, and subsidies, or that they cannot take up the extra allocation per head because of the difficult conditions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair question. I say that apart from a few marginal grants or loans which are given in recognition of very special circumstances and difficulties—they are not just the allocation of Treasury largesse—the crofter is getting exactly what is obtained agriculturally in other parts of the country. Certain exceptional difficulties are recognised and aided; but apart from that, the subsidies and aids are broadly the same as they are in agriculture throughout the country, from the Home Counties, throughout Central Scotland to the Western Isles. I am saying that by the time it reaches the crofter, the value per £100 of aid in Benbecula, for example, is very much less than it is in Central Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member agree that certain problems, not on the same scale, but nevertheless similar, arise in Arran, which, 	<i>mutatis mutandis,</i> can be met by the same sort of terms as the hon. Member gets for the Western Isles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that. I was not criticising the hon. Member's speech. I recognise that in Arran and other areas there are problems very similar to those of the Hebridean crofters. There are difficulties of communications, of having to work on a small scale, and the rest. But my point, in talking of aid to crofters and the Isles is that, if I want to modernise an old house in Lanarkshire, or Bute, I can get a grant, just as a crofter can, in respect of my own property. If it can be shown to have a life of 30 years—or 20 years, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
practice, with most local authorities—I can obtain a large loan and also a generous grant, which means a much greater degree of assistance in that area than it means to a crofter or other person in the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain restrictions in these cases; but so there are for the crofters. We must remember that the croft house remains as security for the grant or loan, but that the crofter does not get as good real value in aid as I get for my house in Lanarkshire. Furthermore, the question of security enters immediately into the question. Indeed, I now begin to wonder what additional securities—which are not already heavily mortgaged or committed—in respect of his existing croft house and buildings the crofter will have to provide for certain benefits to be provided under later Clauses. Merely to imagine that one gets a whole new range of expected extra benefits generally distributed merely by altering the definition and by bringing other areas within the Bill is not necessarily realistic. I assure the Committee that, where there is a certain few marginal benefits which crofters get these are highly justified as a recognition of the very special difficulties they face, remoteness and so on and which no other areas would want to have to share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the average crofter in, say, the Island of Scarp, in Harris, would find it much easier to live and work even in the Isle of Arran. Hon. Members who do not know the former would, if they went there and saw the conditions, realise the isolation and difficulties faced by the people who live and work there. I am sure that they would be only too eager to return to Parliament and say, "These people deserve every consideration and should be getting every special assistance we can give them".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be realised that the Government and the Board are starting with a great number of difficulties in these vast areas and when considering the matter territorially alone, the idea of adding new areas is not wise or attractive to start with. Only the success of the Bill and the Board's operations will justify the extension of the area. We had better wait that success, which will soon advertise itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that the discussion seems to be going purely in terms of the benefits which come from the designation as crofting. This particularly underlines the remarks of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan); it must be viewed not as crofting from the agricultural point of view but in the whole context of development, social and economic as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussion of the Amendment, particularly on this side of the Committee, tends to beg the question of whether we really want these different areas included in the Bill and under the powers of the Board. I know that many of my hon. Friends are worried about the powers of the Board and are anxious that particular areas should be included—that is, if we can be satisfied that the Board will benefit us. I realise, however, that the question of whether the Board will be of benefit will come up for discussion later in our proceedings, when we discuss its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our views on whether particular areas will or will not benefit must be considered in relation to the eventual powers of the Board, as the Committee may amend them. However, this does not preclude discussing the point at this stage of whether the powers of the Board should extend to other areas as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) on this issue. However, I thought that he left out of his list of areas one of the most important of all. Kincardineshire. We find Aberdeen and Angus mentioned but he missed the real meat in the sandwich and I suggest that our consideration should include Kincardineshire, that is the Mearns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question underlying the Amendment was put by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) in that it is not just a matter of extending the Board to cover an area greater than half of Scotland but one of trying to discover the common features and problems of areas and using those as the criterion for giving the Board powers covering a wider area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question of remoteness. Is that a good criterion on which to judge whether the powers of the Board are sufficient and whether its activities should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
be extended? Obviously all hon. Members could suggest other areas in Scotland, but it must be agreed that the crofting counties suffer the problems of remoteness and also the problems of communication. The real argument for possibly extending the areas of the Board is connected with the question of development. I am sure that all hon. Members accept that in the Highlands and north of Scotland, if we are to see industrial development in terms of economy and effectiveness, it is obviously better that such development should take place in certain centres so that it could be of a size and capacity to make a real impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great example of this is the pulp mill at Fort William, where development is based on forestry and where it can be seen that it is better to do this on a large scale which benefits not only the immediate vicinity but parts outwith the area of Fort William. It can be seen that developments of that sort are far better than piecemeal developments on smaller projects throughout the Highlands. A single investment like the Fort William development is almost certain to give a greater return than piecemeal development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This begs the question, if a development like this is to be of real benefit to the whole area, must there be good communications to other areas as well? The answer is obviously, Yes. This brings me to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West and the example which he gave of the proposed road through Glenfeshie connecting Aberdeenshire and Inverness-shire. This is one example of how counties, other than crofting can benefit from good communications because forestry interests in the Upper Deeside and Upper Donside have told me that they, as well as interests in my own constituency, will benefit tremendously from a project of this sort, if it is carried through. It is an example of how consideration of the Highland problems cannot be divorced from our consideration of the problems outwith the immediate area of the Highland counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that he is putting a case which is diametrically opposed to the one which I put on Second Reading?
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Does he visualise that the areas he has in mind—in proximity to any of the seven crofter counties or, perhaps, within them—will become growth points? I appreciate the case that he is making for good communications—although he is not, and, I suggest, we should not, at this point, consider when we shall get them—but does he envisage that the present depleted population would travel 30, 40 or 50 miles to, say, Fort William? Is he against the creation of employment of other sorts on the periphery so that those living considerable distances from the main centres are able to get work? Otherwise shall we not get even worse depopulation than we have suffered in the past, particularly in the outlying areas away from centres?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point, but he appears to have missed my argument altogether. He fails to understand that the real benefit that comes from such a development as Fort William. The benefits of that development are felt not only by those actually employed in the pulp mill but by those there in the service industries and others as well. The number actually benefiting from employment in the pulp mill itself represents only a fraction of the total employment which stems from a development of this nature. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not felt only in Fort William but in areas far afield; in the forestry areas and among workers in the forests more distant, those in the service industries elsewhere and by people in much remoter areas. That is why hon. Members must not be parochial about it. They must look farther afield to see where the ripples extend and benefit the more remote and distant parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that an improvement in communications and roads would bring a wider area of forest within the ambit of the Fort William development. It would make it economic to bring timber to Fort William from distant parts. The benefits would be felt as far afield as Aberdeenshire and Kincardinshire. I have spoken with forest interests in these areas and they assure me that if the road through Glenfeshie is completed it would be economic for them to send timber to Fort William.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that all growth points should be pulp mills?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I would certainly not suggest that. I am merely pointing to the great benefits which derive from a development of this nature, a development which is based on a native industry. Forestry has its very roots in the area. There are many other industries which could be developed; for example, those based on agriculture, food processing and others. To speak only of the pulp mill is to confine one's argument, but if I went further on this issue I would probably be going beyond the context of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An industry mentioned briefly by my hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) was that of fishing. Again, in areas outwith the Highlands there are fishing communities which have problems very similar to those in the Highlands. I would exclude—and I stand to be corrected by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon)—certain areas where the larger fishing ports and communities do not face the same problems as the smaller communities and villages. For example, Angus and Kincardineshire have problems which the bigger fishing communities of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire do not face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the bigger fishing communities it is easier, for example, to overcome transport difficulties because of the large quantities of fish being landed. It is possible to make provision for transport facilities, handling facilities and so on which the smaller fishing communities cannot do. This problem is now being highlighted. Hon. Members no doubt realise that British Railways are reviewing their freight rates for perishable produce, including fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
In the bigger communities, where large quantities of fish are being landed all the time, it is possible for the merchants and others to make arrangements with road transport interests to take over the trade concerned. Ofter large consignments are involved, perhaps a full wagon or lorry load going every day to the consuming centres in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the smaller ports however—and this is where the problems become parallel with those of the remote areas in the Highlands—the quantities of fish being landed cannot always be measured in terms of a wagon or lorry loads. Perhaps only a few boxes are sent. This question of transport and communications problems affecting the smaller fishing villages is of great importance. It is another example of how the problems of the east coast of Scotland and other areas outside the Highland area are similar to those within the Highland area itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to a further problem which is similar; the social problems in areas outwith the Highland area as well as within it. We have in Kincardineshire, Perth, Angus and elsewhere many glens with self-contained communities, very similar to those in the Highlands and Islands. The social problems within these communities are, in the general terms of community life—entertainment, access to other centres of entertainment and transport—very similar indeed. These problems are being faced in these glens where it is sometimes difficult, for example, to get people to work in forestry or on farms because, unless one can offer these social facilities, people are not attracted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
