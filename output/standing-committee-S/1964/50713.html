	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to open this debate, because it concerns the future of those great stretches of Scotland which lie outside the highly industrialised central belt. Three-quarters of our population and most of our Members of Parliament are contained within that central belt, a narrow strip of country. But most of Scotland lies outside, and it is in these remoter places that much of the natural wealth of our country is to be found and certainly most of the beauty and some of the finest surviving traditions which are associated throughout the world with Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to open my argument by reminding the Committee of the way in which these four regional studies were started. They were part of a sequence of development which embraced the Local Employment Acts, the associated special Measures for the establishment of the strip mill and the pulp mills, and the Budgetary concessions of 1963 which were designed, and very successfully so, to spur on the industrial development of Scotland, and in particular the establishment of new industries. Taken together, these policies of the Conservative Government provided a pattern which surpassed any programme for regional development in the Western World. They were followed by the Central Scotland Plan, which concentrated large public investment in this critical part of Scotland, and that in turn was followed by the four regional studies which set out to research in depth into the economic state of the rest of Scotland. Taken together,
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
the Central Scotland Plan and the four regional studies cover the whole of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the first time in our history that an economic enterprise of this magnitude had been undertaken. Much of this was done in the face of constant and denigrating criticism by the Opposition of the day, who appeared to be incapable of understanding the industrial revolution which was taking place in Scotland and which was being guided and encouraged by the Government and by public-spirited individuals and bodies in Scotland. To their credit, the official spokesmen of the then Opposition did not assault the concept of the four regional studies. Because of this, I hope that we may be able to conduct this debate in our usual spirit of parliamentary calm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These four studies were designed to provide in themselves a comprehensive plan for the development of the whole of Scotland outside the central belt. They covered the North-East, the Highlands, the Borders, and the South-West. In some cases they overlapped, and deliberately so, because the problems of one region are often shared by the region next door. I was particularly glad that the Highland study included those parts of the Highlands which lie outside the narrow Scottish Office definition, which until then had been restricted by the accident of history and county boundary to the seven crofting counties. My own constituency, Perth and East Perthshire, is covered by both the Highland and the North-East studies, and that decision conformed to the characteristics of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very glad that when the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) became Secretary of State he decided to continue these studies. This showed an appreciation of Conservative policy which he had previously lacked. It was a positive move, and a welcome one, particularly so as his Government have done precious little for Scotland since taking office. But I must be fair. They have provided some advance factories, but all of them concentrated in the central belt. They have introduced their Highlands and Islands Development Bill which, it was stated in the balmy pre-Election days, would provide employment for everyone in the Highlands and everyone who wanted to return there. This was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
splendid vision, backed by £150,000 rising to £1 million, and a complete paucity of ideas about what in fact will be done to meet the Highland problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have a forestry programme, so small that I will spare the right hon. Gentleman's feelings and not mention it. If any of my hon. Friends want further details, they can obtain them from the Forestry Commission's headquarters, which are to be enlarged, not in Perth, but in Savile Row, W.1, where the trees of Green Park can be seen from the roof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What a contrast all this is with the heady promises which were made at the Election. What splendid prospect did the Minister of State—I am sorry that he is not here at the moment—hold out for us in his Election broadsheet—the unleashing of a
	<br><blockquote><p>"dynamic to get Scotland going again".</p></blockquote>
The electors of Edinburgh, East, unleashed the dynamic of the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State. We see him sitting on occasions with us, a spent dynamo, his generating power gone, and the re-charging period of the Summer Recess gets farther and farther away the more his Government muddle along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four regional studies were started by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) about two years ago. He hoped that they would be completed this summer. Perhaps the Secretary of State when he replies will tell us whether all four have been completed. In a Parliamentary Answer on 25th May he indicated that the studies of the Borders and the South-West were completed. In a Written Answer to me yesterday the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour said that a preliminary report on North-East Scotland was being considered by the Scottish Economic Planning Council. Is this so-called preliminary report the completed study for the North-East region, as I suspect it is? What is the state of the Highland study? The Committee will be interested to know whether all these studies have been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This side of the Committee will also want to know today why the Secretary of State refuses to publish these studies. He was right to continue them. Why, then, will he not also publish them, as my right hon. Friend the former Secre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
tary of State intended to do? If the right hon. Gentleman does not want to publish them separately, let him publish them together, which was indeed, the course favoured by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll. But whether separately or together, these studies should be published so that the vital information which they contain may be made known to local authorities, to industry, and, indeed, throughout Scotland. In the memorable words of the Minister of State, "The people of Scotland want to know". How often we have heard that cry; how deeply those words must be engraved on the heart of the Minister of State. Let him bare his bosom to his right hon. Friend and prevail on him to publish these reports and let the people of Scotland know the findings of these comprehensive and fundamental researches into the state of our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This call for the publication of the studies is not restricted to my right hon. and hon. Friends. The Liberal Party support our view that they should not be secretly hidden away, and their thin cry should be heard. Many local authorities also are asking that the studies should be published. One letter, typical of others sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis), came from the Town Clerk of Kirkcudbright. I quote from the letter with my hon. Friend's permission. The Town Clerk reports that his Council had learned that the South-West study was not to be published. He goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My Council feel that this leaves them in a very difficult position; a similar Report for the Central Belt of Scotland was, in fact, published and is now being implemented and the Local Authorities there know what is expected of them. The Local Authorities, however, in this area have no idea whether what they have in mind would fit in with the terms of the Report and therefore attract support from the Central Departments, or having taken the trouble to prepare something, they then find that the Central Department will not support them."</p></blockquote>
The Town Council of Kirkcudbright is not alone in this view. It is shared by many people who cannot understand why the Secretary of State, having consulted them in the preparation of the studies, will not then let them know what the studies have revealed, or reassure them that their opinions and deep local experience have been properly taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
One may ask what the Secretary of State is afraid of or what he has to hide. He made a revealing statement on 7th July when he was good enough to tell me in a Written Answer that the studies had
	<br><blockquote><p>"still to be correlated with one another and with a review of the situation in Central Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I have no quarrel with that, but the right hon. Gentleman also said that plans would be prepared for the economic development of these areas
	<br><blockquote><p>"within the framework of the forthcoming National Plan."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th July, 1965; Vol. 715, c. 	<i>227.</i>].</p></blockquote>
He said that he hoped that these plans would be published before the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this latest Answer is taken with other Answers given by the Government on this question, it is clear that the National Plan to which the right hon. Gentleman refers is the responsibility of his right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. It is he who will call the tune and, if we judge by his planning achievements so far, the melody may not be a pleasant one for Scottish ears. Perhaps it is in this that we find the real reason for not publishing what should be published. The Secretary of State may fear that the proposals for the future contained in these studies will not be acceptable to his right hon. Friend in Whitehall. The First Secretary of State may be unwilling to divert to Scotland the investment which we shall need, so that performance will fall short of the hopes and plans put forward in the studies. Or perhaps the recommendations of the studies will run contrary to pure Socialist doctrine. So the right hon. Gentleman has taken the easy way out of this quandary by refusing publication so that Scotland will never know what might have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the Government are already downgrading the importance of these studies. They are now being described in Parliamentary Answers as "preliminary reports", in an attempt to present them as minor papers of little consequence. But they are far from that. The content of these studies was set out in Appendix 1 to the White Paper, Development and Growth in Scotland 1963–64, Cmnd. 2440. I will not read
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
the full range which the studies were to cover. The main headings are Employment, Demography, Industry, Transport and Communications, Other Infrastructure Services, Power Supply, Investment, Physical Studies, and there is provision for additional lines of inquiry. Under the heading "Industry", the Appendix shows that the studies would
	<br><blockquote><p>"bring out the future prospects and employment potential of industries already established."</p></blockquote>
There was also to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"an examination of the potential for development of new employment".</p></blockquote>
This is just the information which we in Scotland are thirsting for. Why are we to be denied it? If the scope of the studies has been reduced by the right hon. Gentleman, perhaps he will tell us why. If the scope has not been reduced, why is he now describing the studies as "preliminary reports" when the information in them is certainly comprehensive and a great advance on any economic study ever carried out in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the right hon. Gentleman does hope to publish this year are Socialist plans for the future development of Scotland. I am grateful to him for this information last week, although I regret very much that we shall now never know the extent to which these match the needs shown by the regional studies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will ask the Secretary of State some questions about particular aspects of these studies and these plans. You will appreciate, Mr. McInnes, that I shall touch on one or two questions only, because many other hon. Members hope to catch your eye and I hope that more hon. Members than usual will be able to contribute to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the studies cover all regions of Scotland, some problems are common to them all. First, I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman what attention has been given in the studies to the question of depopulation in areas outside the central belt and what proposals he has in mind. I understand from an announcement made a day or two ago that the right hon. Gentleman is making a special survey of depopulation. Perhaps he will be able to tell us to what extent this springs from the regional studies and what he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
There are two levels of depopulation which I hope the studies have covered. One is the movement away from the glens and the remoter parts of our country, continuing at a slower pace the long, sad history of the vanishing people. In modern times this has reflected the falling away in agricultural employment and in the economic reality of life in a predominantly industrial nation. I do not believe that it will ever be possible to bring about a dramatic reversal in this trend and to repopulate the glens as they used to be, but our regional policies should be designed to arrest the trend by encouraging wider opportunities based on forestry and on other forms of employment related to the natural resources of the countryside—canning, tourism, craft industries and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small enterprises of this kind may employ only a handful of people, but relatively small developments can make the world of difference in remote places. There have been advances of this sort and I hope that more will be encouraged, perhaps by making it easier for the enterprising little man to have access to advice and inducement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other level of depopulation affects some of our country towns where the nature of local employment is inadequate or insufficient to hold the population. Here again I do not believe that we can ever hold things just as we should like them to be and provide local employment suitable for every boy leaving school and every young man entering his profession or trade. Indeed, it would be economically foolish to make the attempt. There must be a constant movement of people from one place to another, seeking new opportunity and blazing new trails. But let the movement be contained more within our own country so that the high road to England is less travelled than it used to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a significant improvement in these last years. The industrial face of Scotland has changed, with old industries giving way to the new. In mid-1963–64 the increase in industrial employment in Scotland was greater proportionately than in Britain as a whole. My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) deserves much of the credit for this break-through, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
the growth engendered by the regional policies of these last years will continue for a long time yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was right to concentrate Government help, and the taxpayers' money, in the areas of relatively high unemployment and to move on from there to the acceptance of the principle of growth points, which is such an important feature of the Central Scotland plan. Perhaps the next stage should be to apply the growth points principle more widely in Scotland, although on a much smaller scale. It may be that we are now approaching the time when the actual level of unemployment should no longer be the main criterion in determining where Exchequer help should be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can illustrate my point by using a constituency example. Perth is a prosperous city by most standards, and hon. Members must take it from me that it is the finest place in all the world. If there is nowhere quite like it, there are other country towns in Scotland which may share its problem. In a place like Perth the margin between prosperity and decline can be narrow. Employment there was growing until recently but latterly the employment opportunities in the city have been falling away. I shall not detain the Committee with the details but a drop of 700 people in employment is a serious matter for a town of this size. The level of unemployment is low but this conceals some measure of migration partly to the south, partly to other places in Scotland, and of course mostly among young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that other hon. Members representing country constituencies share this experience of a disturbing falling away of employment opportunity in these remoter places. It is easy to exaggerate it, but it is there, and the problem will grow unless it is more closely met. This is why I suggest that before long consideration should be given to extending the growth area principle more widely. I have in mind that some of the suitably placed towns in Scotland, outside the central belt, should be designated for limited development, perhaps with an employment target recommended by the regional studies and towards which financial and tax inducements would be directed. These towns and smaller
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
burghs would act as trigger points dispersed throughout the country. Their limited development might well turn the trend of depopulation and help us to spread more widely the growing prosperity which has come to Scotland and which our people have richly earned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of the regional studies, which was revealed last year, shows that questions such as these were to be reviewed. It is all the more pitiful that the Secretary of State will not open up the studies for everyone to view and consider and argue about. If the right hon. Gentleman changes his mind now, he will be all the more respected for it, but if he does not publish these researches he will find that mumbo-jumbo about national plans and the rest of the trying Socialist jargon will not blind the people of Scotland to the truth that he is concealing from us facts which we ought to know. The right hon. Gentleman has disappointed us often enough. I hope that he will give us reason to praise him this morning by announcing that he will publish these four regional studies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. McArthur) would say something. He spoke for twenty minutes, and I am still waiting to hear something. What do the Tories intend to do about anything? I have come to the conclusion that the Leader of the Tory Party was right when at the Berwick by-election he said that the Tories were taking time out to study their long-term policies, the implication being that before the General Election the Tories in Scotland had no policies at all to put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that there were occasions on which the hon. Member thought that he was at Pitlochry rather than at the Scottish Grand Committee. His string of Perthshire perorations was more worthy of presentation to people who had come to be entertained than any who had come to be instructed in the new thoughts of the Tory Party. We waited for those, and we did not get them. The hon. Member sketched the background, had a good bash all round, said, "Let us be friends, let us get together and not call each other names", and a couple of sentences later he was away again. He did not even sketch in the middle distance.
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
He certainly did not go far back enough to sketch in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are given the idea of a party of dynamic planners who for 13 busy years had been planning the whole development of Scotland. In fact, the year 1950–51 was the year of the anti-planners, when planning became a dirty word. It was not until ten years later that the Tories stumbled and groped towards some measure of responsibility for planning, and it was not until 1963 that we heard something about the Central Scotland programme—and it was not a plan but a programme. We examined that in detail at the time, but the hon. Member should know that that programme was preceded by a study of Central Scotland which was never published. Perhaps he can tell me why. It would have been very sensible to publish it, but it was thought far better to trick it out with what policies the Tory Party had. What we had from the Tories was a collection of projects, most of them already started, some mentioned in principle and some just mentioned. The Scottish Development Council said that it lacked any real industrial content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the approach of the Election the whole clamour in Scotland was to the effect that one could not concentrate on parts of Scotland and neglect the rest, and so the Tories published studies for the rest. The noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) can remember this as well as anyone. I remember the wonderful speech which she made in the House just before she became a Minister. She had become tired of this, and she said that she had come to the conclusion that Scotland must be treated as a whole and the regions fitted in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) made a speech, I think on the same day as the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South, in which he said that he did not want to repeat in Scotland the errors made in England with the concentration on one central part and the resultant congestion. Then he discovered that the right thing to do was to concentrate on one part and ignore the rest. Later there was the outcry that the rest of Scotland was being neglected and that there was need for something to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem did not start in 1961, 1962, 1963 or 1964. As has been said, this is something which had been going on in the Highlands for centuries but was aggravated by new aspects of change in the structure of Scottish industry and of British industry generally. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire mentioned the Local Employment Act. Does he remember the debate in the House, in an attempt to draw attention to the needs of those areas, when "Reckless Reggie", then President of the Board of Trade, said that he could not do anything about depopulation and migration and that we could only stand Canute-like against the tide? It had to go on, he said; depopulation was the result of people preferring to go to work elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These studies on the part of the Tory Party were one after another the result of drift and of being pushed into things. Migration was running at the rate of 25,000 a year. The right hon. Member for Argyll in his speech at the Highland Institute in Glasgow in 1964 said that he would keep people in Scotland. The Tories would build cities and roads, he said. At the time that he was speaking migration had reached its highest peak at a rate of 40,000 a year. Now, after 13 years of their doing nothing about these problems, we on this side of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
Committee are having to get down to the business of dealing with them.

This depopulation problem is not peculiar to Scotland. Depopulation in Scotland is counterbalanced by congestion in the London area and in the Midlands. We saw office buildings going up and up year after year, and more building being done in London probably than in the whole of Scotland. We had to wait until we came into power to try to stop this, and in this task we are not getting much help in Committee or on the Floor of the House to pass the necessary legislation. Positive action and negative action must be taken to deal with these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He forgot that he was speaking in a Scottish Committee.

I come to the planning machinery. It is four months since we set up the Scottish Economic Planning Council, which is working with the Planning Board. I give this amount of credit to the latter part of the Conservative Party's 13 years of office: it gathered together a Scottish Development Group. We therefore had in the Scottish Office the nucleus of a planning unit which we have strengthened and formed into a real planning unit which, with the help of the Planning Council, constituted of men drawn from both sides of industry and of wide experience, is going through working papers and determining what can be done, not for one part of Scotland, but for the whole of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been foolish indeed to deny ourselves the help which would come from these studies in the Borders, the Highlands, the North-East and the Southwest, so, rightly, we decided to continue them, but not exactly in the same way as was done with the Central Scotland Plan. The hon. Gentleman spoke about Kirkcudbright. The local authorities in Central Scotland did not know that a study was going on there. In these studies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
which we have continued we have been consulting local industry and local authorities, and the people in the areas have been participating in them to that extent. I am sure that the extent of their participation is not yet finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These investigations are being made in depth. The bodies are expected to produce by the autumn a broad outline of the Government's plans and proposals for the economic future of Scotland. Scotland wants to hear what the proposals are. Hon. Members who represent constituencies in the Highlands and the Borders know what the problems are. What they want to know more than anything else is the solutions which are proposed for them. But hon. Members should remember that the migration study to which the hon. Gentleman referred is fundamental, because of this single fact, that the area which is not losing population to the same extent, taking the overall picture, is Central Scotland. The answer is because into that area go people from the Highlands, the North-East, the Border, and the South-West. Therefore, whatever we do in one area affects another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be misleading to take one isolated study and to publish that without considering how it fits other areas, how it reacts on other areas and how Scotland is affected and can assist in reaching the national gaols which Britain must reach if we are to get the economic growth which Britain requires. We have more than one migration problem. We have migration problems, not just from Scotland into England or abroad, but within Scotland which vary in effect with every area which we study. This is why we have decided to make an analysis of the migration problem which was asked for. If the Planning Council decides that it requires more information and asks for it, the Planning Board sets about getting it, with the help of the other Departments. I am sure that the hon. Member agrees with us on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the regional studies is at this stage a plan. They are very necessary pieces of analysis and are in the nature of working papers for consideration by the Economic Planning Board. Three studies—those for the Borders, the Southwest and the North-East—are now before the Planning Council, and I expect the study on the Highlands and Islands
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
to be with the Council later this summer. This is properly a matter about which everyone is concerned, and that is why I welcome the chance to clear the air about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before outlining the work which the Planning Council and Planning Board have in hand, it is worth setting the general scene and rehearsing the main problems of the Scottish economy. They are the high rates of emigration and the high rates of unemployment. Although the present reduced rate of unemployment gives cause for satisfaction, it may mask, as the hon. Member said about Perthshire, a continuing high rate of emigration. The best way to solve unemployment is not by losing people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts which are available from the Registrar-General show that the people we tend to lose are those with skill and younger people, and the people who tend to stay are the older people. This is one of the problems of Perthshire and of the Highlands. There is unbalance within Scotland. Eighty per cent. of the people in Scotland are in Central Scotland, but the 20 per cent. outside Central Scotland are further unbalanced in the age structure of the population. The longer this goes on—and the hon. Gentleman allowed it to go on under Conservative Governments for 13 years and took no action to stop it—the more difficult it is to achieve a holding operation, far less a build-up of industry in these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total net loss of population in Scotland from 1951 to 1964 was nearly 400,000. Bearing in mind the nature of that loss, we appreciate its gravity. Unemployment has been consistently twice the average for Great Britain, in good times and bad. In the last 12 years the male labour force in Scotland dropped by 33,000 when in the rest of Britain it rose by one million. These are things which leave no room for complacency of the kind which we had from the hon. Gentleman in his perorative opening. This is a sombre background. It is the reason why this is a British problem, why we need planning in Britain and why we need further planning for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historically, we see this happening with Scottish basic industries, and it will continue to happen. There has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
a speed-up of depopulation in agriculture. It is a case not of people wanting to drift away, but of people having to go because of the state of prosperity of agriculture and because of mechanisation. We spoke about this matter in-this Committee last week, and I do not need to go further into it. The basic industry of coal mining has lost, and will continue to lose, mines through the closure of uneconomic pits. This is a further aggravation and an additional burden in planning new industrial growth in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new growth industries are as yet unrepresented. However, something is being done about this. I would give the credit for this not to the right hon. Member for Argyll but to Jack Maclay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman did not give him the credit when he was here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spurred him on and emphasised the need for more action. I strengthened his hand in bringing projects to Scotland. I made the running in setting up the strip mill. The only vocal back-bench Tory in those days was the Scottish Tory Party Chairman, Sir John George, who said that we did not need it and did not want it. The only Tory who we could persuade to come into the open—and all credit to him for it—was Walter Elliot. But there was a strange silence among the rest of the Tories. We know only too well what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have our share of the growth industries, but we have not enough. I do not think that anyone would seriously quarrel with this appreciation of the main difficulties confronting the Scottish economy. The new planning machinery is examining the ramifications in some depth so that we can see more clearly what the right solution is. The work on the four regional studies taken over by the Planning Board at the beginning of this year is well advanced. Three of them are before the Planning Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people, understandably, want to know why they have not been published. It was never intended, even in the first instance, that they would be published as they came out. Does the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) take exception to that remark? Does he admit that he never intended publishing these studies as they came forward?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has never been the intention to publish these reports separately. That is what the right hon. Gentleman said on 21st July last year. He said that they could best be combined in a single document, and we agree with this view. The outer regions cannot be considered independently of one another or of Central Scotland. It has been argued that because the last Government published the Central Scotland White Paper we should publish our reports on the Borders, the North-East, the South-West and the Highlands. The comparison is not with the Central Scotland White Paper, but with the Central Scotland Study which preceded it, which was never
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
published. It was a confidential document prepared by the Scottish Development Group, the forerunner of the Scottish Economic Planning Board, for discussion among Government Departments, including the Treasury and the Cabinet. It formed, as our studies are doing, a basis for Government policy, and rightly so. The parallel document on North-East England was not suitable for publication and demands for its publication were, quite properly, resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the policy was decided the programme for Central Scotland was published in a White Paper with supporting arguments drawn from the study. This is how we shall proceed—first the studies, then the consideration by the Economic Planning Council and the Government, and then the proposals will be published. But, instead of dealing with just one part of Scotland, all the studies, with the new work on Central Scotland, will be drawn together to give us a picture which makes sense for Scotland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Central Scotland Study and White Paper were prepared without any consultation with outside interests, the current studies are being carried out with the help of extensive discussion with the local authorities and industries. This has had the effect of keeping those in the regions in touch with our thinking. Three of them, in the initial stage, have been before the Planning Board, which has asked, in many cases, for further information. No one would suggest that all the information which has come from these surveys is adequate to the task of drawing up the Scottish plans. What I am concerned to do is to get proper discussion of the information, and from the studies will come plans and proposals which will make sense and which will fit the needs of areas with Scottish needs and with Scottish planning in the context of national planning for economic growth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. Although he accused my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Mac Arthur) of saying nothing, for 25 minutes he has said exactly nothing himself. I accept absolutely from him that the first programme for Central Scotland was the result of studies and that the information from them was published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues throughout said when this programme was published that it was only the drawing together of things which had been done. He has had the advantage of these papers and of information coming in for eight or nine months. We should like to know what he proposes to do. For 25 minutes we have had not one word from him about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will get that when we get the publication in the single document which he himself announced. We shall give more than the studies. We shall give our proposals as well, and they will, I hope meet the criticism of the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) of this central area plan. It will have an industrial and economic content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Report on the Borders, which is the first, covers an area in which the dominating issue has been depopulation. Agriculture and textiles are the principal industries, and the Board took in the past and present population structure and the possible pattern of industry. It also considered how acute the labour shortage in the textile industry can become if present trends continue. It is against this background that solutions are being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman knows quite well that the only possible way to get labour into the Borders at the present time is to have overspill agreements with Glasgow. Help in establishing factories must be based on whom we can employ from Glasgow. He must know the limitations upon that as seen by the failure to realise hopes of overspill, not only in the Borders but elsewhere. The other possibility is a new town—not a proposal on which one can proceed without a great deal more than just consultation and study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot, under the Local Employment Act, give any help to the Border area, but the Conservative Party did nothing about this. It was not that the Government were not asked to do something. We had one Local Employment Act, which was to change these things in 1960, and we had a second Local Employment Act in 1963—which brings us even nearer to the point at which, if all these things were in the mind of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
Government, they might have taken action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out of these studies of the problems should come the kind of legislative action we require. I hope that when we bring forward legislation we shall have even the Liberal Party not playing midnight games with us and using delaying tactics, but appreciating that the more that is done to delay one Bill, the more other Bills are held up. I hope that we shall get the kind of legislation that is essential for the Borders, the Highlands, and other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area is the South-West, including Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire. Anyone knowing that area knows that the problems there have to do with agriculture and the other changes which have taken place. In this case we have a real regional centre, Dumfries, on which to build. There is an entirely different migration problem—in fact, I was told that there is considerable migration from Glasgow to Dumfries, and that this was one of the facts which decided the Planning Council to ask for further information. I should like to know how many of these are people going back into retirement to the place from which they originally came. I know that the draws of geography and local patriotism are very considerable there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor is what can be done about the Solway. There must be reconsideration of the new importance which this scheme might have if the Sol-way barrage were feasible—and a study of the feasibility of the Solway Barrage is going on now. This might considerably affect the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third Report deals with the North-East—the most populous area in Scotland outside the central belt. It has a population of nearly 900,000, about 17 per cent. of the population of Scotland, but it has 25 per cent. of the net Scottish migration. It may well be that depopulation in this area is even more serious than we have hitherto thought. I am sure that the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir), from her talks with local authorities over the years, knows that it is essential that this matter should be properly considered by everyone. Two main divisions would be Aberdeen and its hinterland, and the small fishing towns; and the Dundee-Perth
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
area. There are entirely different regional problems within one region. It is in this kind of situation that the Planning Council will work out the industrial prospects in considerable detail from demographic studies and predictions of population. The two areas have marked economic differences, and cannot be grouped into a single whole. The methods best suited for one might not suit the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that there is no dearth of Reports on the Highlands—we get a new Report every ten years—but there is a dearth of action. The Highland Development (Scotland) Bill was very expeditiously dealt with. I thank the Opposition for dealing with it expeditiously both here and on the Floor of the House. The way it was done does us credit in meeting the legislative needs. We now have an authority for the task. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire to sneer, but no limit is written into that Measure; the £150,000 mentioned is only for setting up the administration in the first year. Why does he not be fair about these things?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chance is there. If this Highland Development Authority proves its worth, I sincerely hope that no Government will deny it—and certainly no Government of which I am part will—the necessary cash properly to rehabilitate this area. It is not just a question of getting people back there because they used to be there. It is a question of recognising that not only economically and industrially do we need these changes but that for the social health of Britain we have to break up this anchor of congestion which ties people to two or three areas and leaves the rest of the country deserted—in some cases wilderness, in some cases, private preserves. The Buchanan Report, if it taugh us nothing else, taught us to think again about the use of space. There is an opportunity to do something within these regional plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this summary account of the investigations being carried out, and of how me mean to publish them—and the word is "publish"—will indicate to hon. Members opposite that some of their fears in this respect are quite illusory. Not only will these investigations be published, but the broad proposals for putting things right will also be published, and I hope that they will have implications
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
for the future work of the Committee, not only in respect of discussions but in respect of legislation and finance to back up this final plan for the wellbeing of the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) on a remarkable opening to our discussion. He covered so much of the ground which I had in mind to deal with that he has left me almost denuded of material. I wish that I could say the same thing of the Secretary of State. Since I have been in this House I have heard criticisms from outside of the Scottish Grand Committee and the Scottish Standing Committee, with the suggestion that consignment to it is a fate almost worse than death. The right hon. Gentleman's speech was precisely the sort than can only confirm the reputation which this Committee has in some places outside. It was entirely typical of his reputation as Secretary of State to date—an enormous quantity of words, and no action or promise of action whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing this morning the Government's policies—if they have any—for regional planning and regional development, and perhaps it is not unreasonable to recall what they have done by way of positive action, as opposed to the establishment of various committees one on top of another, over the past nine months. They have increased the petrol tax by 6d., thereby particularly damaging industry in Scotland, which is dependent on long-distance road communications—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And helped the old-age pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no element of regional policy in that. We have had a higher Bank Rate which, as the right hon. Gentleman has himself pointed out in the past, is a blunt-edged weapon which hits hardest at Scottish areas. We have had the Government's decisions over depreciation and investment allowances, particularly for the developments districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest example of what the right hon. Gentleman referred to as positive action to induce development in the less-favoured areas and negative action to
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
reduce congestion in the over-developed areas was the decision of his right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport to give a £4 million subsidy from the taxpayer—to whom? Was it to the railways of Scotland? Not a bit of it. The subsidy goes to the London Passenger Transport Board. This is a fine example of the Government's regional policies in action—a direct subsidy to the area of greatest congestion in the United Kingdom, and one to be paid for by, among others, the taxpayers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the vexed question of the publication of the various regional studies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take it that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can speak only for myself. I certainly oppose it, because I believe that it is fundamentally contradictory—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must part from London Transport, and deal with the proposition before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that we are not discussing London Transport, Mr. McInnes, I was merely suggesting that it was regional policy in reverse, and it therefore seemed relevant to our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to the publication of the various regional studies. Whatever the right hon. Gentleman may say, we have seen a remarkable change on the part of the Government Front Bench. On 9th December last I asked the Minister of State to assure us that there would be no delay in the publication of the Study for North-East Scotland. His reply was, "Yes, Sir." I take it that he meant that there would be no delay, not that there would be delay. That was fairly clear in the context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then the Government have changed their front completely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is not the need for co-ordinating the various studies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but simply that the Treasury has said "No". The Treasury refuses to advance to the right hon. Gentleman the money needed to carry out the projects which these studies will be likely to contain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is up a gum tree now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us have no running commentary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McInnes. We are well aware from our experience that the right hon. Gentleman is in no position whatever to carry any weight against the influence of the Treasury and the Department for Economic Affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the time, I will refer only briefly to another aspect of the work which has been imposed on the Scottish Planning Council. The Minister of Transport has decided to put in a new stage in the procedure for considering proposals for the withdrawal of rail passenger services. His decision is that any such proposals from the railways shall be referred to the Scottish Planning Council. Announcing this in March, the Minister of Transport said that regional councils
	<br><blockquote><p>"… will be given full opportunity to advise me on the planning implications of any proposed closure. … This procedure will ensure that regional planning is not prejudiced by rail passenger closures and will ensure that in those cases in which I decide that closures are justified, I have been able to take account of all the relevant considerations."</p></blockquote>
He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… consultation with the regional councils and boards will in most cases be made at the same time as the proposal for the withdrawal of the service is being considered under the procedure set out in the 1962 Act."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 31st March, 1965; Vol. 709, c. 1650.]</p></blockquote>
I take it that that refers to the Transport Users' Consultative Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular instance of the way in which this works out, or is threatening to work out, in my constituency. The railways have announced an outline proposal for the withdrawal of the passenger service from Stanley to Kinnaber Junction. Back in June the railways' proposal was published in the national newspapers. On 16th June the Minister of Transport informed me that he had received no
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
such proposal. On 1st July the railways informed me that outline proposals had been sent to the Minister. I presume that they will now be sent to the Scottish Planning Council for consideration. I do not accuse the Minister of Transport of ill-faith in this matter, but inevitably people in my constituency are highly confused about what is happening. They have seen that the Minister told me that he had received no such proposal and they have also seen the proposal in the newspapers. Now there is to be further delay while the matter is considered by the Scottish Planning Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never been able to understand how the Scottish Planning Council is, in the words of the Minister of Transport, to be able to ensure that regional planning will not be prejudiced by rail passenger closures. Either the Planning Council will consider those proposals before the T.U.C.C.s, or at the same time. In either case much of the relevant information discovered by the T.U.C.C.s will not be available to the Planning Council. The possible withdrawal of freight services would, I should have thought, have as much effect on the region as the withdrawal of passenger services, but it is not within the province of the Minister to refer that to the Planning Council. The delay in consideration of the railways' proposal has caused confusion in the area. I cannot see that this serves any useful purpose. It seems a great mistake that it was ever introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard nothing so far from the right hon. Gentleman about positive action to produce a better spread of industrial development in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom. We have heard nothing about differential tax inducements. The right hon. Gentleman was very annoyed with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) when she referred to differential taxation introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling) and said that there was nothing new in this, but of course there was. This is precisely the sort of initiative that we need, and we have seen nothing of it to date from right hon. Members opposite.

I draw the attention of hon. Members opposite to an interesting study, which was drawn to my attention by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
Scottish Journal of Political Economy. It considers the prospects for development in the Highlands and the North-East. I cannot go into this in detail, but I refer to the author's conclusions about the North-East that the major task of providing 34,000 new jobs will fall on manufacturing industry, that is, if we are to reverse the trend of de-population and to secure more employment in the area. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are great possibilities of expansion in manufacturing industry since costs are lower and the difficulties of attracting industrialists less marked."</p></blockquote>
It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regional studies have a tendency to over-emphasise the mobility of manufacturing industry, neglecting both the psychological reluctance of entrepreneurs to move to new, distant locations and physical obstacles."</p></blockquote>
There is much in this study which is worthy of examination by hon. Members opposite. The lesson which it brings out is the one on which we should concentrate this morning, that no amount of planning councils and round-the-table discussions will solve the problems of Scotland today. What we need is a programme, including further tax incentives, to urge industry to concentrate where there is room for it to expand and to discourage the exansion of industrial development by the subsidising of railways in the South in the way in which this Government have gone about the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has any evidence whatever that the Secretary of State has no influence with the Department of Economic Affairs and the Treasury. The Whitehall journalists' grapevine tells us that he has very considerable influence. Even if it were true that lack of influence with the Treasury was the reason for not publishing plans, it would seem very strange because I cannot think that Mr. Maurice Parsons, as a good central banker would have any reason for not wishing plans for Scotland to be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always difficult when one does not know the inside of a Department to say whether or not a certain thing should be published, but I should like my right hon. Friend to bear in mind that many of us would be happy if as much information as possible were published. There should be a hammering out of ideas on
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
the anvil of informed opinion. There may be very good reasons for not publishing information, but I ask my right hon. Friend to publish as much as possible, as soon as possible, and to take Scotland into his confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my contribution this morning is narrow. It is to suggest that attached to the new university of Stirling, a new department should be set up, not only for research into teaching machines and programmed learning but also for the production of teaching machines and other instruments of great help in training men for the technological revolution. I recall a conversation which I had with the directors of an American manufacturing firm, Hewlett-Packard, which we welcome as bringing modern industry of the kind we want to Scotland. I asked about the sort of people they wished to recruit, and one said, "Well, in our type of industry, we have to face it, we want those with some grounding in mathematics".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time I spoke in the Scottish Grand Committee, it was to put the case for the elite mathematician and those mathematical high-flyers who would serve in key posts in technology. On this occasion I suggest that if we are to get the industrial regeneration which is needed, there is the problem of producing those with a grounding not only in mathematics but in technical studies which will enable them to change their jobs several times during their life-time, which will go on to 2010. In such a revolution, not only because of shortage of mathematics teachers in schools, programmed learning will play a vitally important part, perhaps because the 14-17-year-old works with most confidence if he can work at his own pace under a teacher's guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central argument here is that a branching teaching machine and various other kinds of audio-visual aids enable a boy or girl—in the future industrial revolution the contribution of girls will be as important as that of boys—to work at their own pace and give them confidence. If we can use mechanical aids properly, there will be a far greater supply of skilled manpower than we have ever had before. We have to face the fact that even when unemployment in Scotland was at its height in 1963—in West Lothian the rate was 9 per cent.—there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
was still a shortage of highly skilled people. My concern is to produce those who are highly skilled, and I make the suggestion that this can be done by a far greater use of branching teaching machines and other kinds of programmed learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, perhaps, is easier said than done, because at present our efforts are not co-ordinated. Hon. Members can point lo many worthwhile schemes which have taken place in individual schools in their constituencies, but there does not seem to be any sort of overall plan in this direction. My suggestion is that a production unit should be attached to the new university of Stirling where the Vice-Chancellor Elect has said that he wishes to specialise in educational methods and techniques. This would be a sensible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case anyone thinks that this is rather esoteric, I have a text for saying that this sort of scheme should be carried out. This is what the present Prime Minister said when he was Leader of the Opposition, speaking at Preston on 19th June, 1964. I always find reading speeches by leaders of Oppositions extremely rewarding they repay study. He said.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that Research and Development contracts should be placed with aircraft, electronics, and other firms affected, with groups of young scientists, with Government research establishments, and with the technical departments of universities and colleges of advanced technology, to enable the research workers, the technicians and the productive workers to achieve a whole series of breaks through in the civil field. We have become accustomed to Research and Development contracts in the military field; it is urgent now to be working out a similar procedure in the civil field."</p></blockquote>
My proposition is that attached to the university of Stirling there should be a consortium of firms already interested in mechanical aids to teaching, such as Ferranti's and such as those doing some of the highly skilled work in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bothwell (Mr. James Hamilton). Alternatively, there is the question of attaching to the university a small public enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that it might be assumed that it would be quicker to come to some arrangement with a consortium and to attach this to a production unit qualified to work not only with the new univer-
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
sity but also the teachers' training college at Falkirk, which we hope could go on side by side with this project. On the other hand, there is a great disadvantage in a unit not tied to a particular firm. I ask my right hon. Friend and his officials to study the Report of the Public Accounts Committee and in particular the evidence of Sir Richard Way on behalf of the Ministry of Aviation. There is outlined the whole argument in relation to the equality of information. Contrary to the view of Sir John Lang in his Report on the Ferranti affair, Sir Richard Way, after nearly a year's study, has come to the view that perhaps equality of information is an unobtainable and unrealistic objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who attended the course run by Elliott Automation on Wednesday morning heard a direct answer given by Elliott's that in the case of a fixed price contract the firm would not be a party to opening its books, nor did it believe in the principle of equality of information. If this is so, contracting on a large scale for experimental devices becomes very difficult. It is for this reason that I am inclined to think that a publicly owned industry for teaching machines would be rather better than an arrangement of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason which particularly sways me towards a publicly owned unit is this: to have a successful operation, a successful production of teaching machines, not only for schools but also for further education, it would be necessary to bring the teachers into the process, to let the teachers contribute to the experiments which would form the basis of any production line. If teachers, headmasters, directors of education and, most important, training officers of firms, are to be brought in, there is no question but that it would be very much better to give them an equality of information, which private firms would not be prepared to grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, I urge my right hon. Friend to consider attaching to the University of Stirling at first a small production unit for programmed learning, not only for the later years at school, but also for apprentices on whose skills the future regeneration of Scotland and Scottish industry will depend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
A gloomy view was taken by the hon. Members for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) and Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). If I were asked the most remarkable thing which had taken place to our country—after the maintenance of full employment—I would say that perhaps it was the announcement of the Ministry of Technology, in conjunction with the Scottish Office, that it was expanding the facilities at East Kilbride, that it was expanding the possibilities of numerical control and computer-aided design, because those of us who have been to East Kilbride, and who have had large numbers of contacts with Elliots and Ferrantis and other industries on whom the future of these Islands will depend, feel that in computer-aided design we have one of the really important industrial revolutions of the future. It is a great and far-reaching decision that the main expansion of computer-aided design in Britain should take place in Scotland. I only hope that by combining the proper training of school leavers and of apprentices with the provision of advanced numerical control and computer-aided equipment, we shall be able to set in motion an industrial revolution which will put Scotland in the forefront of technological progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was slightly unfortunate that once the fete had been declared open we found it difficult to drag the Secretary of State away from the coconut shies. He might perhaps in his summing-up add to the content of the tail end of his speech and give us a little more information about how he sees his plan for the whole of Scotland developing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say at the outset that we in the Liberal Party most certainly support the Government's view that there must be overall planning for the whole of Scotland. We are firmly opposed to the kind of so-called planning which went on under the previous Administration, when only one part of Scotland received attention. The Secretary of State was a little vague on one point, on which I should like clarification. To what extent will there be local participation in the formulation of each regional development within the National Plan? We in the Liberal Party regard this as an extremely important point. The Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
ment should have at the back of their minds some kind of long-term view on how the future development of Scotland will be administered. For example, have they been considering this together with the reform of local government? Have they been considering the possibility in the long term of establishing regional councils on an elected basis which would have more comprehensive powers, perhaps, than the existing county councils and which would be able to look on each region as a whole? We should like further information on points such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The areas covered by the four regional studies which we are considering this morning have all suffered from the common problem of depopulation. I want to speak in particular about the Borders, but much of what I say about the Borders is of application to the other areas. In the four Border counties which together make up the Border regional study—Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, which make up my constituency, and Berwickshire—the loss of population shown by the census in the ten-year period 1951 to 1961 was 7,200, which is a depopulation rate of 6½ per cent. in ten years. That 6½ per cent. conceals the real situation, because there was a rise in the population of young people and elderly people. The real weight of the loss of the population occurs in the age group 20–45. An examination of the census shows that over the ten-year period the depopulation rate in the age group 20–45 was not 6½ per cent. but 21 per cent., which is an absolutely staggering figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This reveals the real problem which has existed in parts of Scotland such as the Borders. They have been losing the young and the skilled people. Those people have been going elsewhere to find a wide variety of employment. If one adds to the figure shown by the 1961 census the estimated figure of loss of population up to 1964, it will be found that in the three years since the 1961 census there has been a further loss of population from the Borders of 1,700, which makes for the 13 years during which the Tory Government were in office a loss of population in the Borders of 8,900, which is the equivalent of obliterating a town larger than Selkirk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman clarify these statistics? I find the use of statistics in relation to certain age groups misleading. Very often when these figures are quoted the number of people entering the upper age group are counted as migrating, whereas they are still in the same district. Would the hon. Gentleman say definitely that these are figures of people who have left the district, not of people who have merely moved into a higher age group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that people move from one age group to a higher age group, but one would expect young people to move into the middle age group. The figure of 21 per cent. represents the drop between 1951 and 1961 in the number of people aged between 20 and 45 living in the Borders. In other words, the young people have not been coming into the higher age group. They have been leaving the area. Those within that age group in 1951 are no longer in that age group. They are in the higher age group. We are losing the people who should come into the middle age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of the Liberal Party, these studies should be published, for the reason which I mentioned when I began my speech, namely, the question of local participation. I believe that it would be helpful if these studies were published, or if the suggestion of the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) were followed and as much information given as possible so that local authorities, chambers of commerce, Border development associations, and so on, could have detailed information on which to express authoritative views to the planning council and to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I believe that the studies should be published or as much information given as possible, although I do not attach a great deal of importance to this, because I doubt whether the studies have produced much information which we do not already have. In the Borders there was in 1948 the very comprehensive Mears Report. In 1953 there was the Report by the Scottish Council on Development and Industry. There is no lack of studies on the problems in the Borders. We know what the problems are. What we require, as the Secretary of State said, are solutions.
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
If the studies do not contain solutions, they are perhaps at this stage not of great value, although they would obviously give us more up-to-date information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loss of population in the four regions of Scotland with which we are concerned is to some extent accounted for by the inevitable mechanisation of agriculture and the drift from the rural areas. I should like to see in all these areas an attempt made by the Government to maintain village life wherever possible, to replace the loss in population from the farms by encouraging the maintenance of effective systems of rural transport so that people could still live in villages while possibly working in towns five or ten miles away. Further, the replacement of local crafts should be encouraged. For example, the development of forestry could be allied to the development of small sawmills, and so on, in an effect to keep the population as much as possible in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that to a certain extent the rural drift in population is inevitable. What has been happening in the Borders, and I think in the other areas as well, is that the drift has gone on from the rural areas into the burghs and at the same time there has been a drift out of the burghs to Central Scotland, England and overseas. In the Borders there is the particular difficulty that the main industry on which the burghs survive is the woollen industry—knitwear and tweed—in which the greater percentage of employment is female employment. It stands to reason that, unless there is some male employment in the area as well, these industries cannot be expanded and the population cannot be kept stable. This is a problem peculiar to the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, in past years not only has there been a lack of sufficient new male-employing industry coming in but existing industry, because of lack of employees, has been unable to expand in the Borders. Dalkeith, East Kilbride and Gateshead are some of the places which have benefited from the expansion of Border firms in other parts of the country, not through their own choice, because it is a relatively uneconomic way of running an industry, but simply through a lack of a large pool of labour and a stable population in the Borders. The woollen industry has made a tremendous contribution to our exports. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
could make a still greater contribution. From the point of view of the industry, it is clearly desirable that new male-employing industries are brought into the burghs so that this industry can expand and so increase the nation's exports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one or two suggested solutions to the problems of my region, but they apply also to other regions. We must tackle the basic facilities of each region. I think, first, of the railway. In the last two or three years it has been impossible for local authorities in the Borders, however zealous, to attract industry into the area when not only were Government hand-outs available elsewhere but the main railway route through the area was under threat of closure under the Beeching Plan. I welcome the step by this Government to refer railway closures to the Scottish Economic Planning Council. I welcome also the decision that railway closures must be decided in the context of regional development. If this is done with the line from Waverley to Carlisle, it will mean that the line cannot be closed, because it is vital to industry—not only to existing industries, but to any new industries which may be brought into the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the question of hospital facilities. I was surprised to learn that these are not being considered in the present study. We have suffered for some time from being put further and further back in the hospital building programme. It is no good Governments of whatever party shelving the responsibility for this on to the regional hospital board, because when it was Government policy to create the new town of Livingston it followed that the Regional Hospital Board had no alternative but to press ahead with the replacement of Bangour Hospital, which is a hospital of exactly the same age and condition as the Border Hospital at Peel. In other words, Government policy influenced what the Regional Hospital Board had to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the failure to provide for a new hospital in the Borders as merely part and parcel of the problem of the whole development of the area. I hope that such questions as hospital facilities will be included in any plan which is produced for the area. I am thinking not only of a new general hospital for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
whole area, but of geriatric accommodation. I have discovered that a standard formula is used in considering the needs of particular parts of Scotland. So many geriatric beds are considered desirable in proportion to the population. As the Secretary of State said, certain parts of Scotland carry a higher-than-average percentage of old people because of the drift. This is true of the Borders. Therefore the standard formula procedure does not work and we have a chronic shortage of accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I appreciate the hon. Member's plea for Peel, may I ask whether he agrees that we cannot jump to conclusions on Bangour until there have been final discussions between the Minister and the West Lothian County Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking on the basis of a reply given to my predecessor, the late Commander Donaldson by a Joint Under-Secretary in the last Government. I will show the hon. Gentleman the reference afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The technical college at Galashiels should be mentioned. This could be developed for managerial training as a potential source of supply provided that there are industries in the areas round about it to provide an outlet for people trained there. I was most impressed by the new building itself and by the people who work there. It could provide basic facilities in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am categorically opposed to the proposed solution of these problems by the establishment of a new town, and I find that all responsible opinion in the area is opposed to the idea. It is an attractive solution if one is sitting in Whitehall or in St. Andrew's House. On the face of it, it seems to be a good idea, and it is a form of Government machinery which has worked well in certain areas in the past. It seems a good idea when an area has been losing population to say that a new town should be established or an existing town expanded, but this is not the solution for this particular area. The problems of the small burghs would not be solved by it. A 1d. rate in Jedburgh raises £240 and in Kelso about £300. Each of these towns daily exports people in buses to work in the mills at Hawick, and it will be no improvement if instead
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
of going there they go to a new town. The problems of the burghs will remain. We must look at the history of the towns and the background of development in the Border region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a responsibility not only to the present generation but to future generations. This area has a peculiar pattern of life of its own. There is competition between the burghs on the rugby field and there are the historic common ridings. The solution is not to create a massive new town without these traditions but to graft small industries on to the burghs. Mr. Middleton, who was in the area recently, raised the question of this solution. The only people who support a new town are the Scottish Landowners' Federation, no doubt with memories of what happened at Fort William with the development of the pulp mill. But it will be an extraordinary sight to have the present Secretary of State arm-in-arm with the Scottish Landowners' Federation against the local authorities, against the Chambers of Commerce and the Development Association, and so on. I hope that these points about the new town solution will be carefully considered. There is a shortage of housing in the area generally, and obviously some further assistance other than by existing local authority methods must be given because of the problem of high rates. If new industries are to come into the area there will have to be a supporting housing development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned the Local Employment Act, 1960. When the Bill was being debated in the House the Liberal Party put down an Amendment to make depopulation a yardstick for assistance as well as unemployment. This was opposed by the then Government and was defeated, but it was supported by the Labour Opposition, by the present Secretary of State, the present Prime Minister and the present President of the Board of Trade. Here is a means of using existing machinery to provide assistance in areas of this kind. If that Act could be amended to include the yardstick of depopulation, assistance could be given without the need for new and elaborate machinery. It is a ludicrous point, arising out of the previous Government's policy, that if the 8,900 people whom I have mentioned had not had the initiative to seek employment in England, in Canada and in Australia
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
and we had had unemployment queues instead, these areas would have received assistance. The fact that the population has gone away means that the areas receive no help at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy which should be pursued is that of giving different inducements in different parts of Scotland to different kinds of industry. I give all credit for what happened in Central Scotland under the last Government. Many new projects were established there and were welcomed, but the trouble was that the Act gave assistance indiscriminately, not only to the larger units but to the smaller employment units. These smaller units made negligible contributions to the economy of East Kilbride, for example, but they could have made a valuable contribution to the economy of the other areas which we have been discussing today. We want employers of from 15 to 200 men to be attracted to these areas. They should be refused assistance to go to Central Scotland. Discretion of this kind in Government policy would make a big difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the development of industry, the big American company, L. S. Starrett & Co., came to Jedburgh in 1959 with the assistance of the local authority. There were prospects of employing 1,000 men in a magnificent new factory, but that industry has never developed its full potential. It employs only a quarter of that number because Board of Trade regulations prevented the company from importing all the parts from America which it required in the initial stages to train people to produce a wide variety of goods. This point was taken up in Opposition by the present President of the Board of Trade, when, speaking of the firm's effort to expand, he said in 1963:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Surely the Board of Trade will be willing to show a little discretion and flexibility in trying to enable it to do so? … the President should do his best to encourage a scheme giving employment to an area of this kind."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th July, 1963; Vol. 681, c. 1759.]</p></blockquote>
I took up the matter with the present President of the Board of Trade and we had the same dusty answer as we had from the last Administration. I hope that the Secretary of State will realise that, without any new and vast public expenditure, if the right form of legislation is introduced, there is possible employment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
in the next ten years for an additional 600 or 700 people in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among my suggestions for helping areas such as the Borders is Government assistance for tourism. The Government should look at this matter carefully. Tourism in Scotland in 1963 earned £80 million, of which £20 million was in hard foreign currency, yet no assistance is given by the Government to the tourist industry in Scotland. The Northern Ireland Government gives £200,000 a year to help tourism. The Government of the Republic of Eire spends £3 million a year to encourage tourism, with great effect. It should be part of Government policy to earmark certain investment for tourism in Scotland. All the four regions which we are discussing this morning are areas which could benefit from Government assistance. The expenditure involved would be amply repaid by the increased earnings of the industry, particularly in foreign currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among plans which I hope will be further pursued in future, I see new sources of population in the provision of facilities for industry. By providing these facilities we should retain the existing young population, and we should reverse the migration which is going on. This has been the experience already with the Fort William pulp mill. Before the General Election I was told that 400 to 500 letters had been received from Scotsmen in Central Scotland, in England, and overseas who were anxious to come back when they saw opportunities in Scotland for the employment of new skills. I believe that this would be just as true of the Borders and that we could draw back the people who have been leaving. We could also provide employment for the overspill population from Glasgow and other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I talked about these things during the recent by-election campaign I was attacked, not because what I said was not true but because it was alleged that I painted a bleak picture of people in the Borders going cap-in-hand to the Government. This was not the case at all. These problems are not difficult to solve, given the will to solve them. There is no question of asking the Government for public charity. All we say is that Government policy should be such as to allow the Borders to compete with industries with the other areas of Scotland. The Borders
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
have been placed at a disadvantage in previous years, and we are asking that this be put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a tremendous opportunity and a responsibility in looking after these regions. Decisions in the next two or three years will influence the pattern of development in the whole of Scotland for generations to come. We in the Liberal Party wish the Government well in this urgent task. We press upon them to seek the good will of the people concerned and to take them with them at every stage in the development. Once these plans have been implemented we shall see the rebirth of people, industries and life generally in these areas of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been speaking mainly about the growth points. The growth points as we know them have not arisen through any Conservative Government action. Certainly they are not the result of action by the last Conservative Government. We have not been in office long enough to have created growth points to cater for the employment and other needs of Scotland. The Plan for Central Scotland does not consider the problems of the whole of Scotland as I believe it should. It was used by the last Government to excuse their failures during their period of office. The Scottish Members of the Tory Party played up the Plan for Central Scotland as if they were bringing into being something which was worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I am aware, anything of value which was made prominent by the Plan for Central Scotland was already in being. My constituency is very near the hub of this. No matter how anxious hon. Members opposite may be to create a better and stronger image of their party, not one of them can claim that the Plan for Central Scotland has anything to do with Irvine being a growth point. They pronounced it a growth point in the Plan for Central Scotland, but it was already a growth point. They claimed credit for something which came about through the initiative of the local authority there which went to great pains to try to cure the employment problems in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as a result of the statements which we have had about the Plan for Central Scotland and about a new town in the area, there is now uncertainty in my constituency. People want to know what is to happen. Irvine was a growth point before the publication of the Plan for Central Scotland because of the initiative of the local council. But we are now in this peculiar position: be-
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
cause of its initiative in creating a growth point, because there are still immense possibilities for industry which is still locating itself there, and because there is an overspill agreement with Glasgow which has worked excellently and well, problems are arising which must be solved. The reply which we had from the last Government and so far from this Government is that the Plan for Central Scotland is so fashioned that until they determine the physical needs here, there, and somewhere else, and until they determine whether there is need for a new town in the area, they cannot allow the council to proceed with the necessary changes in the social services to cater for the growing and expanding community already there. This is the cleft stick that we are in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that talks have been taking place. The Scottish Development Department has met representatives from Ayr County Council, from the Irvine Town Council and from the Kilwinning Town Council. I do not know which ground was explored, but nothing definite has emanated from these talks. Because of the added pressures which are causing people to become disgruntled, there is a feeling of frustration among the local residents. Some people are blaming the overspill arrangements with Glasgow for the pressures, mainly on school accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a dreadful thing, because Glasgow people have been absorbed into Irvine. There are the most friendly relations between the natives of Irvine and Glasgow people who have come to the area. I have to attend protest meetings organised by parents and the local presbystery because school accommodation is bulging at the seams. All sorts of places in and around schools are being used to carry on class work. This situation cannot continue for much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what the Department is doing about these pressures. Has it assessed the position for the next two years? Does it know how many overspill families will come to Irvine in the next two or three years? Is it true that 400 families will come to the area? Has it assessed the number of children who will come with these families? Eventually schools will not be able to take children at five years
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
of age. The present accommodation barely meets the needs and will eventually break down altogether. I am informed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the building of a new academy at Irvine is to start about 1967. But the situation will have broken down long before that; I have no dubiety on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only the situation in Irvine itself is causing pressures on social services, and especially school accommodation. We have industries located just outside the Burgh of Irvine. Skefko has made a big expansion to its factory at Drybridge, a few miles outside Irvine. The employees will, in the main, live in Irvine. Skefko's employees are already living in Irvine. A big new factory in the same area of Dry-bridge is presently being constructed for Chemstrand Ltd. for the production of raw nylon which will employ thousands of people in a year or two. In fact, it will come into production next year, when it will employ over 1,000 people. There is no housing in these areas. The nearest popular place to which people can go to do their shopping and can send their children to be educated is the Burgh of Irvine. The present school accommodation for teaching children is quite unfit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only problem. The town council has met me on several occasions and drawn my attention to the problem of looking ahead to the drainage and sewerage and road construction difficulties which will arise. I had a shock when I received a letter last week from the town clerk saying that the Scottish Development Department is now backing out of grant aid for the redevelopment of Bridgegate. I have written to my right hon. Friend about this, so I do not want to say much more about it now. He knows the position as well as I do. To say that there will be no grant for the bottleneck there because of the new road, which will not relieve the harbour area coming up through Bridgegate, is sheer nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expansion of social services is being held up because of decisions which have to be taken at Government level. I appeal this morning for clarification of the position, and especially of the school building needs. We are having trouble about accommodation not because of action by the education authority, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
Ayr County Council, or by Irvine Town Council, but directly because of Government policy. The last Government and this Government believe in industrial location. They believe in and are signatories to the Glasgow overspill agreement. It is nonsense if the education department in Edinburgh says to the Ayr County Council that it has to provide accommodation in the Irvine area out of the budget for the rest of the county. There should, and must, be a special allocation for the overspill and industrial location needs of Irvine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stretching of accommodation has arisen because of Government policy. I hope that this will be recognised and that we shall not have a continuation of the situation in which the county council, in order to decide priorities, cannot take the huge sums which are necessary for developing school accommodation in Irvine because this would bleed the rest of the county and not deal with priorities which are already laid down. The only way in which the difficulty can be met is by the Government recognising that this is a separate question and giving a separate allocation for school building in Irvine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir William Anstruther-Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to cover a wide field because there is not time to do so. I should like to devote my remarks to the question of how I can stimulate the Secretary of State, I wonder whether "stimulate" is the right word. The right hon. Gentleman said that he spurred on a former right hon. Friend of mine and Secretary of State who is now in another place, Viscount Muirshiel. How can I spur on the right hon. Gentleman to produce without further delay a sensible development plan for the Borders? Investigations and inquiries have, after all, been set in train. They have been going on for some little while. It is time that the right hon. Gentleman derived from them inspiration to allow him to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first essential is that we should have sound transport facilities. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. David Steel) mentioned that matter. The Secretary of State talked about achieving a holding operation. Now that a Scottish colleague of his is Minister of Transport, I hope that he will make clear the absolutely vital necessity of retaining the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
railway service between Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Edinburgh as a first-class service and not allowing it to be downgraded. That is the biggest danger that I see in the South-East of Scotland. Until we have a complete assurance on that, we shall in vain invite industrialists to set up new enterprises in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Think of the inconvenience caused to the executive who wants to travel to and from London—and most wide-awake business men require to do that from time to time—if he cannot look forward to getting into a fast train from the Berwick-upon-Tweed area and going to London without first travelling either about 60 miles north to Edinburgh or more than 60 miles south to Newcastle. This would not encourage him to consider favourably any burgh in the Berwickshire area when there are so many financial inducements to him to go to Fife or Lanarkshire where he can have advantages which we are at present denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the late Administration much money—£350,000—was spent on improving Eyemouth Harbour. I am told that troubles have broken out there again; that fishing boats which formerly could have their keels rested on mud now rest, thanks to the improvements, on a hard bottom. They bump on this, and it is damaging to these craft. Unless this problem can quickly be solved, all the advantages of that great endeavour to improve the facilities at Eyemouth will be brought to nought. As the Member for that part of Scotland, I make haste to beg the Secretary of State to take urgent action to remedy that state of affairs and, at any rate, to take a definite step towards improving our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Secretary of State will take due note of and feel spurred on by the important points just made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) very clearly pointed out that the four regional studies were started in the time of the last Administration on the lines of the operation which had already so successfully taken place in regard to
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
Central Scotland. The intention was that they should lead to a White Paper. The studies were undertaken, as the previous study had been, by the Development Group, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, consisting of civil servants of all Government Departments concerned with the subject. The four regional studies covered all Scotland except Central Scotland, and local authorities in those areas were closely consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government changed in October, we learned that the studies were to be continued. The Development Group became the Economic Planning Board—without, as far as we could see, very much change. Presumably, therefore, the same civil servant officials were continuing a study which, by that time, they had probably half completed. The studies, as we in our time saw them, were to consist of a thorough examination of the problems and resources of these regions. An analysis was to be made of the latest position, its causes, and the likely trends for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some well-known and obvious problems have been mentioned this morning, but another point which had to be borne in mind was that the easy and apparently obvious answers were not necessarily the most effective measures. What the studies sought to produce was a combination of methods which in each region would be most likely to be effective. Here, I should like to pay tribute to the officials who are engaged in these studies. It was clear to me when I was at the Scottish Office that they were determined on a sincere search for the best solutions to the problems in these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's speech this morning was pathetic. His reason for spending the first ten minutes trying to find tiny holes in my hon. Friend's excellent speech could only have been the absence of anything constructive to tell us. However, I will take up some of his main points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the right hon. Gentleman said that the Conservative Government had not accepted the Toothill Report. The Conservative Government accepted the greater part of the recommendations of that Report; and what, in my opinion, was the most important recommendation—the concept of growth areas which then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
became enshrined in the Report for Central Scotland. As I remember it, the Labour Front Bench appeared to oppose that concept. That concept was an important change. It is of no use the party opposite pretending that this was nothing, or that it was just endorsing, as the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) said, what was already happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was a change. Government assistance and attention were to be concentrated on areas which were not necessarily those of highest unemployment; not necessarily areas where a coal mine was closing down and there might be unemployment. Attention and assistance were to be concentrated on the areas best suited, because of transport, electricity, water supplies, and other things, for the establishment and growth of industry. Of course, that idea had its debit side, too, because areas in which there was unemployment could well object that they were being neglected by the new policy. The basis that it is better to build on success, and on what is likely to be successful, perhaps 15 miles away from an area of unemployment, and to arrange travel-to-work facilities, was a new concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a change recommended by the Toothill Report—and, incidentally, by various economists at the time. It was accepted by us, and became a major change incorporated in the Central Scotland plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that no action had been taken by the Conservative Government in recent years. What about the pulp mill in the Highland region? Besides providing extra employment on the spot, this project will give extra employment throughout forestry and associated work. New industries and new firms have been coming to Scotland, and I have been very pleased to hear leaders in the electronics industry saying how satisfactory they have found Scotland for their work. The Secretary of State mentioned, as if it were just a passing reference, the decline of some of Scotland's basic industries, such as coal mining. He mentioned that simply as an additional burden, but it is surely this contraction and the mechanisation of agriculture, causing men to leave that work, which have been the main causes of unemployment in Scotland. Those
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
causes were, and still must be, recognised, as raising the main problems to be tackled. It must also be recognised now, as it was then, that our main effort must still be to overtake the disappearance of jobs as a result of the decline and contraction of these industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These studies—we understand from the Secretary of State that three have been completed and one is still awaited—do not mean that nothing should be done in the meantime. From what the right hon. Gentleman said, I understand that he implicitly recognises the achievement of the Conservative Government, at least during its last eight years, because he commended the last Secretary of State but one, the noble Lord who is now in another place. My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), who followed him, did various things for Scotland during his period of office which are still very much in the minds of hon. Members on both sides. I have mentioned the pulp mill, but there is also the move of the Post Office Savings Bank to Glasgow, greatly to relieve unemployment. Such decisions, taken by a Conservative Government—clearly through the influence of a strong Secretary of State—characterised my right hon. Friend's period of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has told us today that he intends to publish the results of these studies. The right hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that we have had that this morning. Previously there was doubt, because it appeared from what we had seen that nothing at all might be published. We had certainly intended to publish a White Paper containing the results of the studies, though not the whole of the studies themselves, with pages and pages of detail, perhaps, for example, on the demographic part mentioned by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention was that the results should appear as a White Paper, and in this connection I quote what my right hon. Friend said in a debate last summer. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that when we publish the plans for the rest of Scotland we will publish them as a single plan …".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st July, 1964; Vol. 699, c. 394.]</p></blockquote>
If three of the studies have come in, there might be a case, if the other study were very delayed, for publishing those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
three, and later the fourth, but if all come in at about the same time, there is advantage—and we agree with the Secretary of State here—in their appearing together, not as complete studies but, as in the case of Central Scotland, as a White Paper, a drawing together of the main points and conclusions so that public and Parliament may be informed of the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had some experience of this kind of thing about ten years ago, when I was an official working in the Cabinet Office. I was secretary of a conference of right hon. Members from both sides of the House. Their report contained confidential information, but that did not stop us from producing a White Paper for Parliament. It was my job to help the conference to prepare a version, with the agreement of Parliament, which produced the main points and conclusions without divulging secret information. That version appeared as a White Paper, which is still available from the Vote Office. The full report, with all the details and confidential information, was taken personally by me to No. 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to depopulation. The four regions under discussion are basically rural areas. Mechanisation and efficient working in agriculture mean that men leave that industry, and the question is whether they leave the area as a whole, or stay and find other work. Boys leaving school who would otherwise have gone into agriculture may find that the jobs are not there. Are there alternative jobs available for them? In the rural areas, the basic problem is to provide alternative work in the same district, in small communities, villages or small burghs. We cannot expect the single isolated house or cottage in the glen to remain, but the occupants should not have to go south to Glasgow, or further afield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is here that units of light industry can help. I have seen this happening in my own area. Units employing 20, 30 or 40 men can be established, and can form a new kind of employment in place of agriculture. In this sphere, private enterprise has a pre-eminent place, and individuals in such areas who are in a position to promote and run units of light industry must be given every encouragement by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
There are other possibilities which had previously not been known or thought about. In particular, we have winter sports. Those who knew Strathspey in the thirties would then have been surprised to see now how much prosperity has come directly as a result of winter sports facilities, and the enthusiasm of people all over Britain for this comparatively new pastime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry has discovered new markets since the war for what are called prawns—but are technically known as nephrops or Norway lobsters—and squid. Because of scampi becoming a dish which people like, prawns have found a market. Squid is not eaten here, but there is a market for it abroad. Squid and prawn are no longer thrown back, but are now a valuable part of the in-shore fisherman's catch. Any new possibilities of this kind must be seized upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn back nine months to see what the party opposite were saying to the electorate on this subject in October. I turn to page 10 of the Labour Party Manifesto and read of the plans for the regions.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of Wales and Scotland, the Labour Party has already made clear what needs to be done by issuing the policy statements, 'Signposts for the New Wales' and 'Sigposts for Scotland'."</p></blockquote>
When we turn to "Signposts for Scotland" we find on page 8:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the same time inducements of various kinds, including special investment allowances and other tax reliefs, will be offered to industrialists who are prepared to take more jobs to job-hungry areas."</p></blockquote>
At the moment a Finance Bill is passing through the House which reduces investment allowances. I ask the Secretary of State to tell us what are the new special investment allowances mentioned in "Signposts for Scotland"? I raised this question in Committee on the Finance Bill. The right hon. Gentleman was there for part of the time, but it fell to a right hon. Friend of his to reply to the debate, and he said nothing at all on this point. I give the Secretary of State the opportunity now to tell us what these investment allowances are and what are the other tax reliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was speaking on the Finance Bill on this subject, I was speaking with a vested interest. I am sorry that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) is not here at the moment. He could look up the Directory of Directors and he would not find my name there. He could look up any number of financial groups or the Stock Exchange and not find my name there, because the vested interest for which I was speaking was the vested interest of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt at all that we all have a vested interest in Scotland. For some of us it is an interest which has been with us since we were born. It was an interest which was with us in the schools to which we went and it is an interest in the homes in which we live, which all our forebears shared and gave us. I would not think for a moment of suggesting that hon. Members are not in their own way interested in Scotland. It happens, of course, that interests very often depend upon backgrounds. It is not always right to construe one's personal interest as being for the benefit of everyone in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express my thanks to the Committee for the way in which it has handled this debate. On the whole we have had a fairly good debate. I do not say that it followed the start given to it by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), but it has enabled us to hear one or two speeches which got down to the real problems of the areas. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) asked that we should publish the plans arising from studies as soon as possible. I assure him that we shall. He said that people wanted as much information as possible. I can tell him that they are getting more information now and that there is more contact with the people in the areas with reference to those studies than there ever was before. This, I realise, whets appetites. The next meeting of the Scottish Planning Council is to take place in Aberdeen. Usually after the meeting there is a Press conference and much information is given to the Press about what has been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) in a very thoughtful and constructive speech mentioned that Mr. Middleton, vice-chairman of the Planning Council, had been in the areas. He met there members of the Planning Council for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
northern area. A further meeting is to take place in Newcastle. There is a certain amount of overlapping in the planning for the North and the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) was, I thought, a bit sour. He did not like anything very much. He did not like the Transport Commission and what it had done. He did not know whether to blame the Commission or the Minister of Transport. But he did not get round to blaming me. He did not like what the Treasury had done. When he came to the point that we should do nothing at all about the problems of the position in London, I thought that he was showing a woeful parochialism which ill becomes one who in the House of Commons is presumed to take an interest not merely in his own constituency in Scotland but from the point of view of the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He was rather mixed up about the T.U.C.C.s. They are concerned purely and simply with matters of hardship to passengers. What has been lacking in the past has been consideration by someone other than the Secretary of State, because hitherto it has been a matter for the Secretary of State to consider how any particular closure would affect the economic development of an area. I think it right and valuable that we should for the first time in considering economic development of an area have the same people giving their considered opinion to the Minister of Transport as to how that would affect this matter. I am sure that many appreciate that if this has been in existence when we had the boil-up of opinion, maybe unnecessarily, in the Highland area it would have saved a considerable amount of embarrassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member knows quite well that the Minister of Transport has not the power to interfere in matters concerning freight. He need not shake his hands at me, for his hon. Friends were parties to the Transport Act, 1962. They were parties to giving power to Dr. Beeching to do all that he did. It is rather late for the hon. Member to blame us after only nine months for not having put right what they did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
Members made speeches to which I must refer. I thank the hon. Member for the points which he made, which have given me a chance to put him in his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles raised a considerable number of points which I think are of value. As I see the matter, the studies are now a prelude to work being done by the Planning Council. The Planning Council is dealing with more than those studies. It has already specified particular industries about which it wants further information as to how growth could arise in Scotland and what has impeded it. Those industries include office machinery, small engineering, small tools, domestic electrical appliances, radio, electronics and other industries which are booming elsewhere but in Scotland not to the extent that they should be booming. We have to try to find what can be done to get the same head of steam behind the development and expansion of these industries in Scotland. From that we shall get the industrial content, the available resources which are in the areas and the possibilities of expansion, given certain policies, which will produce the manpower and retain manpower in the areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member made a valid point about small burghs and the limitations of their history, their circumstances and characteristics in relation to the development which can take place. New towns are not the solution everywhere. We should appreciate that new towns are very slow to develop. When talking about holding operations we cannot talk in terms of new towns for they are long-term proposals. East Kilbride is going ahead under its own steam, but it was designated in 1947, nearly twenty years ago. My hon. Friends know how slow the process has been in Livingston and Genrothes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new town of Irvine is a new conception altogether. Unlike East Kilbride or Cumbernauld, which were new towns in virgin areas, this is a new town created between two other towns. As soon as new towns are born there is the problem of providing new road schemes, sewerage and the rest. Things come to a stop until decisions about the new town can be made. Those decisions have not to be taken centrally. Unless
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
one can proceed with the co-operation of local people, one is held up all along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We called for an interim report by consultants about Irvine. We have received that Report, and on the basis of it discussions are going on with the authorities concerned. The authorities concerned are not merely the two towns of Irvine and Kilwinning, for the great bulk of the new town will be in the county area. We have to get the cooperation of all concerned. This is not an easy matter, but if one proceeds without these consultations one gets nowhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties which have been spoken about. There are such difficulties in every area where there is a concentration of new population and an infrastructure of educational effort with the limitation of neglect in another area where people have failed to do something which needed to be done for a long time. On questions of education and the decision of priorities, the matter is one for the local education authority. I am sincerely hopeful that the authorities will come together and sort out the problem of the whole area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I have only three minutes. We want local participation. I do not rule out the suggestion which was raised by the Scottish Planning Council at its first meeting that it should have smaller 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees in the areas to help in the implementation of these plans. I take the point made about male-employing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question about investment allowances, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Campbell) completely misconceived the whole operation in relation to the Finance Bill which was to create a new tax structure for industry to separate the confusion of personal tax from company tax. With that change we shall have greater freedom in regional considerations which will redound to the benefit of those areas where we wish to give inducements. This was the first important step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the problems which hon. Members opposite have mentioned have existed over the past 13 years. It ill becomes hon. Members opposite to talk about them. The position has grown worse. We are studying the problems and finding what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
needs to be done. We are tailoring our legislative powers to the needs of the particular problems. I hope that we shall have the support of hon. Members—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I would not expect to have the support of the hon. Member for South Angus because he does not understand it.
