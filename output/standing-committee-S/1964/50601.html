	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Housing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's Sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Dr. Dickson Mabon.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1.—(AMENDMENT OF PROVISO (I) TO SECTION 18(1) OF HOUSING (SCOTLAND) ACT 1962.)</div> <!-- clause -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first Amendment, in the name of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very short Clause in a very short Bill. The Under-Secretary of State and his colleagues know that we support the principle of the Bill and that we are not opposed to anything in it. I would, however, ask him a question about the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Clause is to raise by £10 million the limit of Government finance for the Scottish Special Housing Association. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states that under the present commitment the advances to the Association may reach £110 million by the end of the year, the limit which was set under the Housing (Scotland) Act. 1962.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a tantalising way, the Secretary of State for Scotland, at the end of the meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee where we considered the Bill in relation to its principle, said that this was a "holding operation". His actual words were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Bill asking for an extra £10 million is, to my mind, a holding operation until we can get together with longer-term plans on how we can properly expand the use of the Scottish Special Housing Association."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 25th May, 1965; c. 53.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Can the Under-Secretary of State tell me why £120 million was selected, and how long the extra £10 million is expected to last? When is it expected that it will be necessary to come to the House of Commons again to increase the limit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a logical conclusion to the work on which the Association has embarked in recent years. I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary of State could give us information on the lines I have indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am naturally a little disappointed, Mr. Brewis, that my Amendment cannot be discussed. It was essential to put it on the Amendment Paper so that the Under-Secretary of State could be fully aware that in my two new Clauses we shall shortly be discussing there was no question of in any way reducing the amount available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be of help to the Committee if I say that the two new Clauses appear to me at this moment to be out of order also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it from that that during the discussion of this Clause it will be out of order to discuss the contents of the new Clauses. That I think is very regrettable, because both the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I have been doing extensive investigation into the two topics since Thursday when the new Clauses were put down. Our lines have crossed from time to time. It is most unfortunate, because the Under-Secretary of State has been especially called in from the discussions in another Committee on the Rent Bill, that we shall not have a chance of discussing those two aspects of the Scottish Housing Association's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I made it clear at Second Reading that I feared that the raising of the limit of the capital spending of the Housing Association by £10 million to £120 million would be inadequate, having regard, in particular, to the housing needs of the people of Scotland, and also to what I regard as the prospect of a reduction of house building in both the private and municipal sectors in Scotland, in consequence of the Government's financial restrictions. I have already said that it was generally anticipated that house building in Britain this year would be curtailed by about 12½ per cent. It is essential, if we are to make up this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
figure, to provide means of house building by using an agency over which the Government have more or less direct control, the Housing Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, when we bear in mind that the Scottish Special Housing Association traditionally plans for a three-year period, we should provide enough finance for an adequate housing programme for a period of three years. If we compare this figure of £10 million with the performance of the Housing Association in the three years ended March, 1961, when more than 7,700 houses were completed by it, it is clear that a target figure of £20 million should be the minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with this point at Second Reading, the Secretary of State indicated that the performance of the Housing Association in more recent years had not measured up to those of past years, and in particular he pointed out that last year the number of houses completed was just under 2,000. What he did not say was that in July last year the number of houses actually under construction in Scotland was the all-time record of 48,000, while in the same month building standards regulations came into effect, which meant that the minimum standards of building were the highest ever in Scotland. With the building industry employed at full strength, with a massive public works programme and with the building of many multi-storey or high flats, requiring two or three years for completion, it is not surprising that the numbers completed were only just under 2,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not with the past that we are here concerned, but with the future. The speech of the Secretary of State for Scotland confirmed many of my worst fears that the pace of house building in Scotland will be curtailed this year. The amount allowed under the Clause is inadequate for the job which must be done, even on the restricted scale which the Government have in mind. During Second Reading it was indicated that the aim of the Government was to reach a figure of 40,000 completions per year as soon as possible. It is not much of a target to aim at 40,000 completions when 48,000 were under construction last year. The Scottish Development Department estimated more than a
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
year ago that there would be 35,000 completions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State gave us another indication when he said that this year the number of houses to be started by the Association would probably be 2,000 and 2,500. This surely is the figure with which we are concerned, and not with the number of completions which related to starts last year. This is the expenditure which we have in mind when approving or disapproving the Clause. We must also bear in mind that many of these 2,000 or 2,500 will be high flats or multistorey buildings requiring two or more years to complete. The completions for 1966 will therefore be less even than the unambitious figure of 2,000 for the 1965 starts. In 1964, the Association had up to 3,200 houses actually in construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes it clear that the Secretary of State is not thinking in terms of expansion but in terms of stagnation or of contraction. Faced with this possibility of a major contraction of house building in Scotland, particularly of housing starts, it is essential that we should provide a more realistic target for the capital spending of the Scottish Special Housing Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing which is regrettable under the Clause is in connection with the con stituent figures within the grand total of £120 million. When the £120 million was originally fixed there were two other limitations imposed by the Secretary of State through the 1962 Housing Act. One was on the amount which could be spent for conversions and modernisations, and the other was on the question of cost- rent accommodation and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's remarks are out of order in discussing this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I will leave what I had to say. I am sorry that I shall not be able to hear what the Under-Secretary of State has to say on the point I was raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should be aware that the people of Scotland are watching the Government's house building programme and policy with increasing alarm and concern. If there is one clear and just conclusion it is, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the Labour Government depended in October for their results in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Scotland—when there were massive gains by the Labour Party—primarily on the basis of bringing new energy and enthusiasm into solving Scotland's housing problems. If all that the Government or the Secretary of State can do is to point to house completions this year, which stem directly from the activities of the previous Government last year, and if he cannot resist the dead hand of the Treasury and fight for exemption for Scotland from the financial measures imposed by the Government, and cannot state clearly where and how he intends to go in this matter, the inevitable result is clear to all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is inadequate. I hope that the Government will agree to remove this Clause and insert a new Clause with a more realistic financial target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all listened with very great interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). He managed to collect most of the platitudes used in the House in the last fifty years and to cram them into one short speech. He referred to the "dead hand of the Treasury" and other expressions we have heard so often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He quite misconceived the whole problem. He thinks that the Government can put about £300 million into the Bill and that that makes it automatically possible to produce houses. The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), a very experienced expert on housing problems, tried to explain to the hon. Gentleman at our last meeting that it is not money only which builds houses but also the very practical matters of finding the people, the material and the land. We have the desire, but no amount of money on earth will provide houses without those other things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member will be aware that during recent weeks several sub-contractors in the Glasgow area have been paying off men, who could provide the labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not produced any figures to show that the Scottish Special Housing Association has been held up in the slightest degree for lack of money in the whole period of its existence. Housing associations are not free to start building houses
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
all over the shop. They have to build in conjunction with local authorities, as was explained last week. They came into existence not to compete with, but to supplement the efforts of, local authorities, and not to compete with existing methods of building but to supplement them by introducing new methods, and new types of material which were not used in ordinary building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whichever Government have been in power they have always been willing to provide the necessary finance to enable the Association to do its job. It may receive more encouragement from one Government than from another, but there has never been any evidence that the Association has been prevented because of a lack of Government finance, from building the houses which have been within its power to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not it is referred to as "the dead hand of the Treasury", the fact is that Parliament has always been rather chary of approving exaggerated sums of money. It hates having to approve the expenditure of money which is not likely to be used. Many Departments grumble, because if they overestimate they have to hand back the money which is unspent. That is the discipline which is imposed by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has been extremely skilful in bringing in every kind of propaganda about housing, but he must know that houses are not built in three months. It will be a long time before the last Government's housing programme and the starts in housing, work themselves to a completion. Houses take a long time to build, and I suggest that the hon. Member is a little too soon with his propaganda against the present Government. They are planning to build with the aid of the Association and, further, the last Government left them with quite a big housing programme for which no provision had been made, besides a lot of other building for which no provision had been made, and till the building trade and the supply of building materials are expanded, the resources of the country must be rationed, and used for the best purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we build factories, the completion of certain houses may be delayed. If we expand industry it will be of far
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
greater benefit in the long run, than the building of houses. We want to expand and improve our schools. All these things impose restrictions on the possibility of building houses. We are building technical colleges, and we are going to build a new university. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Cathcart will deliver an equally passionate speech in relation to the delay in building universities, colleges and hospitals. The Opposition always have the advantage of being able to deliver this kind of speech. It is done by all Oppositions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member can cheer up. Things will not be quite so dismal as he says, and he may change his mind and cross the Floor to this side at the end of this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) asked why there had been no clear explanation of why the Secretary of State referred to this Bill as a holding operation. I shall try to justify this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a Government succeed to office they have to take stock of the position in the various Departments. The S.S.H.A. has always been very close to the heart of the Labour Party, because it allowed direct intervention by the Government, circumventing all the difficulties involved in using local authorities as agents for building. Not all local authorities build as rapidly or as well as we would like. Some are excellent, but others are not quite so good. The Association has done a lot of experimental and additional work, for which it has not been given very many thanks. That is totally unfair. The Association has done a splendid job, considering that it has had to do all the worst jobs in Scotland as well as pioneer some of the best. We therefore look upon the Association as one of our principal instruments for advancing the housing programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is that at our last meeting the criticism of the Association came from hon. Members opposite and not from this side. When the Minister claims that the Association has a special place in his own party's affairs, I would remind him of these criticisms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that on this occasion the criticisms came from this side of the Committee, and also from a Liberal Member. I do not say that those criticisms in themselves are wrong. Some are well founded in fact, because of the experimental nature of the work which the Association has had to do. On balance, however, it has done a great deal for housing in Scotland. The reason why the Labour Party in particular is anxious that this organisation should be used as an instrument for housing advance is that it gives the Government a right to direct participation in building houses. I am not making this as a negative, partisan remark but as a positive assertion of our belief in the Association as an instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that in 1953 the Association built nearly 5,000 houses and in 1962 fewer than 1,000. It is true that there is a direct correlation between the money which the Government are willing to find and what the Association can build. The 1953 record was achieved because good planning and sufficient money were provided in many years before 1953. As we said at Question Time, it takes at least 15 months to plan a house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to try to make certain that there is no loss of time between now and when we hope to bring in major housing legislation in the next Session. We are trying to conform to the wish of the Public Accounts Committee. We should not need the Bill if it were not for the wish of that Committee. We have enough money in hand to enable the Association to carry out all the work which it can conceivably do between now and the end of 1966, but in order to conform to the wish of the Public Accounts Committer that the Minister should not give approval for expenditure unless the money has been voted by Parliament, we have brought forward the Bill. That is the sole reason for our doing so. There are many things that I should like to say about the Association, but I would not be permitted to dilate on the subject. We have enough money to enable the Association to carry out its work, but we do not have enough money to square our position with the Public Accounts Committee.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
It is the intention of the Government to try to see that the Association shall build over 2,000 houses this year, and certainly to begin preparing for the building of between 2,000 and 2,500 next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) that the Association has traditionally had to plan a three-year programme. Lately it has been working on three-year programmes, but it is no secret that it would desire to plan over a longer period. When we consider how houses mature it seems sensible that the Association should prefer to work to a four or five-year programme. Indeed, one member of the Association asked for a seven-year programme, and there may be some sense in that. The Ministers have this matter very much under consideration, but I would not like to commit the Government at this early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the Bill is a holding operation designed to square our position with the Public Accounts Committee. It is designed to hold the position till the Government can announce their plans for housing for Scotland in the next Session of Parliament. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and Local Government have announced that the intention is to produce a national housing plan which will be justified and fulfilled by legislation in the next Session. I have no doubt that all the matters which the hon. Member for Cathcart wishes to discuss can then be fully ventilated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is quite wrong in his estimate that there will be a fall in house building this year. As I said at Question Time, in response to Questions particularly by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, the Government believe that we shall build as many houses in Scotland as were built last year, and possibly marginally more. If the Clause and the Bill are agreed to we are confident that in 1966 we shall build more than 37,000 and perhaps getting near to 40,000. I cannot pledge the Government on this, because we are not far enough advanced in our plans. Nevertheless, it is our hope to build 40,000 houses by 1966, which is earlier than the previous Government hoped to achieve that figure. We certainly hope to achieve a much higher figure by 1969 and 1970.

I hope that I have satisfied the Committee that this is basically a holding operation, and that the wider plans of the Government will be made known later this year, when I hope that they will receive as grateful a welcome as the hon. Member has given them today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said his plan will be forthcoming in the next Session of Parliament. I wonder if he can tell me when that will be, because possibly an Election may intervene.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point still outstanding. The hon. Gentleman explained that the Bill was made necessary because of the views of the Public Accounts Committee. This morning he said that the Bill will hold the position till the end of 1966. Realising that an increase in the amount of advances was necessary, I should like to know why this figure has been chosen to cover any further necessary action. Does the Minister's answer mean that he foresees that in 1966 it will be necessary to take further action, in view of what he has said about this Bill's being merely a holding operation till the end of 1966? That was what I was trying to ascertain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would have to have a Bill in the next Session to make sure that the Association could carry on its work until 1967-68. Our calculation of £10 million is based on what it is physically possible for the Association to do, and what we would like it to do. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) that the building industry in Scotland is working at full stretch. It has a lot to do, but with better organisation and better methods, it could do a great deal more with the same amount of men. If we give the Association this money to bridge the gap between the end of 1966 and the planning years ahead Parliament will be asked to approve a larger Bill for a substantial programme which would be part of our overall programme for the forthcoming Session of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
hon. Gentleman is not entirely precise, because it is not tied to a year. A Session can go on over two years. What is clear is that in the calendar year 1966, whether we are still in this Session or in a new Session, whichever party is then in power will have to take further legislative action in respect of the advances to the Association. I understand that that is how the hon. Gentleman sees the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are still in this Session in 1966 there is no reason why the Government of the day should not introduce a further Bill.
