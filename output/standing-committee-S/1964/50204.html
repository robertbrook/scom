OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed [2nd February],</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.—[<i>Mr. Ross.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before we were interrupted, we must stress the importance of adult education as a means of providing an adult intake into the teaching profession, because the time taken to create a teacher is not three or four but 16 or 17 years. We are in a vicious circle, because we do not have enough teachers to produce enough of the right kind of pupils, and because we are not producing enough of the right kind of pupils, we are not producing enough teachers. This is the vicious circle which we have to break.<br><br>
There are one or two other factors to be kept in mind. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said that we could not compete with industry. But we have to compete with industry. One of the ways of doing that is to establish a council such as this to increase the status of teaching and act as a counter draw to the attraction of other professions, crafts or jobs.<br><br>
One of the anxieties expressed is that the existence of such a Council, with a tendency to demand increased standards, will tend to discourage an intake, but I believe that it works the other way and that when demands for standards are made, the so-called pool increases. One of my criticisms of the colleges is that they do not make sufficient demands on their students.<br><br>
Another anxiety has been that there is to be a majority of teachers on the Disciplinary Committee. On this committee above all we need a majority of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
teachers if the committee is to be the reverse of tyrannical, because before that committee will come teachers accused of one offence or another, and if there is a majority of teachers on the committee, that will tend to have a cushioning rather than a tyrannical effect. This is the necessary purpose, rather than any restrictive practice. I take the view that rather than having too many teachers on the Council, we have far too few practising teachers, and this is a situation which might be improved when we consider the Bill in Committee.<br><br>
Six members of the Council are to be nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland. This may be the means of reaching some kind of agreement with the Churches, particularly the two Churches which have written to hon. Members. The Secretary of State may consider having consultations with the Churches before proceeding with his nominations.<br><br>
In this connection, I should like to raise the claim of yet another group of people, the trade unionists of Scotland. One of the problems which we shall be facing following the Brunton Report is the attitude of the trade unions to mobility of labour and so on. The Secretary of State should at least consult the S.T.U.C., for almost every trade unionist is also a parent whose children are in State schools, and trade union representation would be a valuable addition to the Council.<br><br>
Perhaps the weakest part of the Bill is to be found in its powers. The Bill lacks teeth. The Bill does not say that a teacher must be registered before he is allowed to teach. This is something which we shall have to consider very closely in Committee, because, unless the Bill has teeth, there will still be the danger of unqualified and uncertificated teaching continuing. On the other hand, the very existence of the Council may make that unnecessary.<br><br>
In the background to these discussions there is always the concept that uncertificated teachers are somehow fully qualified people who have accidentally not gained certification. No one would for a moment expect a hospital to say that while it did not have enough doctors, at least it had many nursing auxiliaries. Nursing auxiliaries are useful, and I should like there to be an extension of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
comparable auxiliaries in schools, but just as nursing auxiliaries are no substitute for doctors, so are uncertificated teachers no answer to the shortage of qualified teachers. In the same way, for a man to have a good bedside manner is not sufficient qualification for him to take out somebody's appendix.<br><br>
We are here dealing not with brutal matters like the removal of an appendix, nor even with the craft which is involved in dealing with metals—and there is plenty of craft in turning and shaping metals—but with something infinitely more precious, a child. Of course, teaching is a job, and also a craft, and we should not be put off by the apparent hard-boiled cynicism sometimes expressed by teachers. A man who has taught in classes of 50 pupils for many years is not only doing a job, but showing a great deal of devotion, and I have found this devotion among many people.<br><br>
We are told that we cannot legislate for status, that status is something which comes by nature. Of course we cannot legislate for personal qualities, but status is a structural and social thing and we can legislate about the structure of society. That is the final argument for the Bill.<br><br>
Despite its weaknesses, particularly its lack of teeth, the Bill is a step forward. The very existence of the Council will bring about an increase in status for teachers, and that will help recruitment. The Bill will help to remind the teachers that their function is social, that Parliament has been concerned with their function in society, and the teachers will respond. What we need is not a devalued but an enhanced profession, and ultimately the child will benefit from that, and it is with the child that we must always be finally concerned.<br><br>
May I express the personal opinion that every child is infinitely educable? We are nowhere near the beginning of an understanding of human development. In the same way, I believe that every M.P. is infinitely educable and perhaps we can learn in our discussions here today. I have not lost faith in the teachers of Scotland. In fact, my faith in them has been increased. The amount of devotion which I have seen among teachers in Scotland, sometimes in terrible conditions, is to be found
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
only among those who care for and love children. I have not lost faith in M.P.s, by the same analogy, despite the scenes that we saw in the House on Tuesday. In new and old schools, I have seen teachers working devotedly for the children in their care.<br><br>
I welcome the Bill and I ask those hon. Members who are worried about certain aspects of it to appreciate that this is only a small start, but that it is taking us once more to the point where education has the position it once held—right at the centre of our way of life. Only through education can Scotland develop and only with the full-blooded and warmhearted co-operation of the teachers of Scotland can we once more see a rejuvenation of our Scottish way of life. With the Bill, Scottish teachers will be assisted to play a full part in that rejuvenation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill for a variety of reasons. It will enhance the status of the teaching profession by giving teachers more responsibility in matters of particular interest to them, something which has been lacking for a long time. The Bill will also have the effect of making the profession more attractive, and that will help in the recruiting drive, which is urgent in view of the raising of the school leaving age to 16.<br><br>
It is of crucial importance that this extra year should be used for the benefit of pupils. The Council will have to give serious consideration to the use of this extra year if it is not to become burdensome and discouraging for the less bright type of pupil—I am thinking particularly of boys. Unless they are taught subjects which they can assimilate during that extra year, their time will be largely wasted.<br><br>
The subject of entry and the granting of certificates to teachers is very important. While the academic attainments of teachers in general are equal to those of other professions, such as medicine and the ministry of the Church, that does not mean that all teachers are equally capable of imparting their knowledge. This is the important point. There is an impression that all teachers who take a degree or a certificate or gain a diploma are equally proficient at teaching, but anyone with experience of educational administration will know that that is far from the case. Some uncertificated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
teachers have the ability to teach, and it is a pity that in days gone by many of them have been lost to the profession. I know many uncertificated teachers who spent twenty years doing a wonderful job. This good work should be recognised, although for many of them the opportunity will have been lost because the same attention was not paid at that time to teachers.<br><br>
I hope that the Council will offer opportunities to more people with a bent for teaching to enter the profession. While stressing the importance of getting the right type of teacher, we must preserve a proper balance. The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) had a good point when he warned against raising standards so high that we automatically reduced the pool. We must guard against that danger at this juncture.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Like other hon. Members, I have received letters from the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland about Church representation on the Council. Whether the Churches are to be represented has still to be decided. If they are to have representation I believe that the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church and the Roman Catholic Church may claim to be represented, but hon. Members have already pointed out that there are other Churches in Scotland. There are, among others, the Free Church of Scotland and the Free Presbyterian Church. Both are strongly represented in my constituency. Both have a long history going back to the Reformation, and both are absolutely unswerving in their fidelity to the principles of the reformed faith. Their testimony is clear and distinctive and they have a fine record in the sphere of education. If different Churches are to be represented on this body any legislation which is brought forward affecting Scotland primarily must have regard and respect for the rights of minorities. I hope, therefore, that if there is to be Church representation on the Council the rights of the minorities will be respected.<br><br>
The Bill is based on the Wheatley Report, and I should like to congratulate the Government on bringing it forward so early. I am also happy to note that hon. Members opposite who have spoken in the debate have welcomed the Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to congratulate Lord Wheatley and his Committee and also my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on bringing this Measure forward so quickly.<br><br>
My own local authority has given a lead on the question of uncertificated teachers. It is well known to hon. Members that the Lanarkshire Education Authority has dismissed about 33⅓ per cent. of its uncertificated teachers. There is, however, a distinct possibility that that authority may require to retrace its steps unless there is a change of opinion both at that level and also in the teachers' associations.<br><br>
The E.I.S. itself has a responsibility to its members. Opportunities have been afforded to the E.I.S. in the past to make the necessary representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Institute has also had the opportunity at its national conference, but the fact is that it is not prepared to make a categorical statement about the entry into the profession. In the early post-war years many of our best teachers, some of whom are now headmasters, were not honours graduates or even graduates at all.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend should grasp this nettle and should declare that he will introduce a crash programme whereby male teachers with the same qualifications as female teachers will be acceptable. We are all aware that it is permissible for a woman to go to training college with only one or two higher certificate subjects, one of them being English, and four ordinary certificate subjects, one of them arithmetic. If a statement on these lines were made, I believe, from convesations I have had with friends in the teaching profession, many of them members of the E.I.S. and some members of the so-called recalcitrant S.S.A. and also some members of the S.S.T.A., that they would be prepared to accept the point of view which I am now putting forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's arguments very closely and I think it only right to say in its defence when he accuses the E.I.S. of never having made a declaration in favour of a male all-graduate profession that, since 1926, until which date male non-graduates could be employed as teachers—some of whom ultimately
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
became headmasters of primary schools—the E.I.S. has consistently advocated the policy of a male all-graduate profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to the best of my ability to make that point. I want the Institute now to retrace its steps along these lines, because the education of our children is something which concerns everyone of us. I can readily appreciate the fear inculcated in the minds of these teachers, bearing in mind what has happened in other professions and particularly in industry.<br><br>
I do not subscribe to the view put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) that at the moment the teaching profession can compete with industry for manpower, because the opportunities and salaries in industry are far in excess of those open to the teaching profession at present. A girl who goes into commerce is infinitely better off than the girl who comes out of a training college to start her career as a teacher. We must give serious consideration to this point. It is also interesting to recall that, in reply to a Question, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said that some of the so-called uncertificated teachers are graduates. To ensure that men enter the profession we must give them the appropriate salary during the period when they are acquiring their parchments. I have implicit faith that the teachers' associations will react to this leadership and will make every endeavour to solve this pernicious problem.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West suggested that the S.T.U.C. should be represented in the Council. The S.T.U.C, which is an integral part of our national affairs, has shown in the past, and is showing now, a deep interest in the education of young people. Technical education plays a more and more important part now in our national affairs, but being a very class-conscious trade unionist I would hope that the E.I.S. would come with us and affiliate to Congress. We would then go with the Institute 100 per cent. in the point of view which it has expressed to us on many occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recollect that the Glasgow Teachers'
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
Association gave a good example. Not so long ago, Glasgow teachers were represented on the Glasgsow Trades Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very good, but the fact that one is affiliated to a trades council does not mean affiliation to the Trades Union Congress.<br><br>
A great deal has been said about Church representation. In these days when the ecumenical spirit is so prevalent and we have inter-denominational services I was most gratified to find that the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church had united in an attempt to get my right hon. Friend to change the present context of the Bill and allow Church representation as of right on the Council.<br><br>
As a member for many years of a local education authority I feel that education authorities in their own right should also have representation, because they are the authorities who select headmasters, headmistresses, infant school mistresses, principals and first assistants. If they are deemed to be capable of doing this important task under the existing legislation they surely should be represented at top level to ensure that they have some say about the sort of person who goes into the teaching profession.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
Although I know that the composition of the Council is a very difficult assignment and that in the process of carrying out his administration in fair-minded fashion some associations will, obviously, be hurt, I would, in conclusion, ask my right hon. Friend to give very serious consideration to the points which are being made about Church representation, and some consideration to the education authorities' representation and, last but not least, representation of some sort from the Scottish Trade Union Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are three points which I should like to raise. The first is one which has been brought to my notice, not, I admit, by a great number of letters, but by some teachers in my constituency who have written about the Bill that they feel that it will not give enough teeth to the Government in their actions. I think that the Secretary of State is quite right in what he said on Tuesday, that the executive and statutory authority must be vested
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
in the hands of the Secretary of State. Some of the teachers seem to have the impression that this Bill will give the Council the power to dictate to the Secretary of State. Obviously, this is a misconception. I suggest that when the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State winds up she should press this, so that more publicity may be given to the point that the Teaching Council is to be largely an advisory body.<br><br>
The second thing I should like to mention is the issue which the hon. Member for Bothwell (Mr. James Hamilton) raised in his summing up of the incentives necessary to produce more teachers. I am quite certain that teaching is a vocation and that we shall not get the proper type of teacher we need in our schools merely by offering more and more financial inducement. Certainly, it is an inducement, and teachers' salaries must certainly be kept continually under review, but I do not think we shall get the right type of teacher if we go on upping the salary here, there and everywhere under every possible pretext.<br><br>
Thirdly, I want to mention the representation on the Council of the Church. We heard much in this Committee about this matter and I have very strong views about it. When the Secretary of State opened the debate in this Committee, I understood him to say that he would bear in mind—if nothing stronger—the representation of Churches. We have heard how the Roman Catholic Church and the national Church of Scotland are at one in wanting representation. They are if I understand them aright, at one in that they do not mind either Church being on the Council as of right.<br><br>
We could imagine a situation in which the right hon. Gentleman's successor would be unable, from a conscientious point of view to appoint a member from a Church or the Churches. It might be that he would be an atheist; we all have our consciences, and I am quite certain that the conscience of that Secretary of State would not be inclined to go further and appoint a member of the Church: I speak about a successor of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State. We do not know who he will be, but I am told that my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) is not an atheist and therefore would follow the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
present Secretary of State in his judgment.<br><br>
I should like the Government to bear this very carefully in mind because, in my opinion, it is a vital point. After all, the Churches are themselves, in a sense, teaching bodies. They are trying, to the best of their ability, to teach the way of God to us. It is vitally important to our way of life, our heritage, and our history, that this golden thread should run through the tapestry of our history. I trust that the Government will have second thoughts about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to congratulate the Secretary of State on introducing this Bill and on the manner in which he introduced it. He stated a most important consideration which is apt to be forgotten in all educational debates, that education does not exist for the teachers or for the local authorities; it exists for the children. In recent times this has tended to be forgotten.<br><br>
It looks to me as if everybody these days goes about with a chip on his shoulder complaining about not having enough wages or salaries; that nobody is getting good enough conditions, not the teachers, the doctors or anybody else. Nobody seems to think about the patients or the children whom they are supposed to deal with. I think a great deal of this is an exaggeration. Teachers today are working in conditions which are better than ever existed in our country before. The local authorities are building palaces for them to work in, far better than Members of Parliament get to work in. The facilities are really excellent, and, while there are still many old schools and many bad conditions, the progress which has been made is simply wonderful.<br><br>
I deplore teachers calling stinking fish on their profession. The profession is proud of itself. It does great work. I agree that the devotion which teachers give to their job is far more in some cases than they are paid for. They do not all watch the clock till it is time to go home, and even after they go home they work in order to make themselves proficient. Many do nothing but live for the profession. I am sure that they get far more enjoyment out of it than the people who are always watching the clock and wondering how soon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
they can quit. Therefore, I hope that a little less of this depreciation of the teaching profession will go into the speeches of teachers and other people, and that it will be recognised as one of the finest professions, and one of the most enjoyable, in the world.<br><br>
My wife was a teacher in times when they had a right to grumble. In the early days of the E.I.S., when somebody moved that they should ask for a rise, some of the women teachers said, "What would we do with the extra money?". That is never asked today. In those days they thought that it would be a strain on the local authorities, and they had such a public spirit that they nearly refused to accept it. In my own experience, during the 1931 election, when the Government were proposing cuts for teachers, I had a deputation from teachers. They were not objecting to the cuts. They recognised that these would be necessary. They came to see me only to see if I could do anything to ensure that the cuts were fairly distributed. There was not the slightest objection to the cuts.<br><br>
Teachers do not always think about the £ s. d. of the matter. They believe in the conditions. My wife recommends young girls to go into the teaching profession, as it is one of the most enjoyable and pleasant jobs in this land. I think that if more people had that spirit there would be a better recruitment of teachers. Even the teachers in this Committee do not look so bad as a result of their experience. They are qualified, intelligent and active and they have not been exhausted by their profession.<br><br>
When we were putting through the Teachers (Superannuation) Bill an actuary was listening. I was surprised at the remark made—I think by the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir)—to the effect that the average age when teachers die was about 82 for men and about 85 for women. Yet we are normally told that between the ages of 60 and 65, a man collapses and is carried off to the cemetery. If that is the case, I said to the actuary, it must mean that some teachers are living over the age of 100. "That is true," he said. "There are quite a number." So we shall not get rid of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
teachers for a long time yet; they will survive.<br><br>
I know teachers today who are 75 years of age, who are splendid teachers and could still work. The local authorities ought to come looking for them, because they are such good teachers. Therefore, when we talk about needing more teachers, we should not ignore the great reserve of teachers who have retired, not because they wanted to, but because they had to. Some of them are working even though they do not get extra wages and even lose their pension. I think that it is a deterrent to drawing on this source if a teacher who goes out to work not only loses his pension but is involved with all the expenses of travel and other expenses in going to work. It reduces the amount which they get for working to a level below what their salary would be if they stayed at home. This does not make sense to many people. But this is the obvious first source for recruitment of teachers.<br><br>
I believe that the status of teachers should be recognised and I think that if this Council is going to do any good in that respect it is to be welcomed, but we should not exaggerate the part which this plays in the minds of the average teachers. They are practical people. While it may be a good thing in itself it will not solve the problem of finding extra teachers. The first reserve, as I said, is the teachers who are trained, who have more experience than any new teacher, and they should be drawn upon. There may be other reserves. Other reserves certainly must come from outside the teaching profession. The Secretary of State said it took five or six years to make a teacher, but the problem for this Council, I believe, is what is to be done in the immediate circumstances, before the five or six years are up, when more teachers need to be recruited.<br><br>
It is no good the teachers insisting that they must have graduates, because if they are not there it is a case of "taking the breeks off a Hieland man" to ask for more graduate teachers. The competition for graduates is so great that there is no sense in thinking that one can win teachers by an auction sale. When I had the responsibility of the Secretary of State, we had one or two professions wanting their professions to be made graduate professions. I refused. I said, "What
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
you want is a rise of wages. That is why you want this graduate status. You want higher status to get a higher income. But there are not enough graduates to start spreading them over another half-dozen professions." We must resist this while being sure that the people we appoint can do the job. Many people, such as those in the probation service, are doing an excellent job without necessarily being graduates at all. Therefore, we must resist this idea that the only people who can do any work for the community are the graduates. There are not enough, and there never can be enough. The standard is now so high that fewer and fewer people are able to get into universities and fewer and fewer people are able to be graduates. Principal Appleton of Edinburgh University, in his report on the subject, pointed out that this continual raising of standards is a restrictive practice, restricting the field from which one can draw. This may be very good from the point of view of status, but one does not necessarily raise the number of people who are able to qualify as graduates.<br><br>
If one cannot get graduates to fill the jobs one has to fill them in some other way and this is the immediate problem to which this Council should devote its attention to, and not, as the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) said, be tempted to develop it along the lines of restrictive practices in order to make a monopoly of the job and make a scarcity value for teachers. We want well qualified teachers but we do not want a scarcity value.<br><br>
The problem, therefore, will only be affected by this Council to the extent that the Council tackle the problem in this way. I hope that it gives practical advice to the Secretary of State and not idealistic advice about high-falutin' qualifications which a large number of people could never obtain. Even the universities are apt to load on a whole lot of somewhat unnecessary subjects in order to elevate their status. This puts the hoop through which people must jump to get a job even higher.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
We must always remember that firms like I.C.I, are waiting on the doorsteps of universities to take the best people, even before they graduate. Unilever and other firms want these people for service
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
at home and overseas. They want them in great numbers and are prepared to pay them high salaries. It can be seen, therefore, that the education authorities are up against it when competing for graduates. This does not apply to only the teaching profession. All sorts of work are being done by people in, for example, the aircraft industry. They are doing odd jobs at high salaries—while the local education authorities and other public bodies are unable to get people to do essential technical and other skilled work. This auction sale is a dangerous thing from the point of view of the community.<br><br>
Is the whole of the teaching profession concerned with academic subjects; the idea that one needs honours graduates to do all teaching, particularly in primary schools? Is this not exaggerating the position? I recall that the previous Principal of Edinburgh University and the Director of Education of Glasgow—separately, without knowing what the other hand in mind—both condemned the idea of trying to press too many qualifications on to honours graduates. They pointed out that they often discovered that honours graduates made the worst teachers, simply because they were so specialised that they could not teach ordinary subjects. They sometimes found that the honours graduate was so satisfied with what he had achieved that he did not keep himself up to date in his own subjects.<br><br>
I mention this to show that this matter can be over-exaggerated; that we can stick labels on people unnecessarily. I know of one education authority which had to sack an honours graduate—a graduate who, incidentally, had three degrees—because he could not keep discipline in the classroom. Discipline may be as important in getting the job of teaching done as the academic side of it. Many qualities go to make a good teacher, not necessarily only university qualifications.<br><br>
We all admit that the trained teacher is the best one and I agree that it is desirable to obtain teachers who are certificated and who have gone through the college of education. Even so, the college of education is building up its prestige and insists that only those who have gone through its courses can really teach. The person who has been qualified to teach in England, having taken a university
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
course in teaching, is not qualified to teach in Scotland because he has not qualified at the college of education. This matter needs rationalising and, for this reason, the college of education should be given university status or something of that kind so that training in it will rank as graduation for the task being learned there. We should train people for teaching and not try to train them to do everything, and then try to turn them into good teachers afterwards.<br><br>
What happens if we cannot obtain the highest quality of teacher? It may be that we need not insist on the highest quality for every job that must be done in the teaching profession. It may be, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) said, that there is a place for auxiliaries in the profession so that teachers may be relieved of a lot of work that could be done by, for example, clerkesses. This might leave the teacher more time in which to undertake the difficult job of teaching.<br><br>
If, when all this is done, we still cannot get the number of teachers we need, we must then make the best use of those we have got. In this connection, I congratulate the Glasgow Education Authority for going ahead with the use of scientific methods of teaching. At least seven years ago I pointed out that while we educate people in science and teach science, we do not always use it to the best advantage. We should learn to use it to a greater degree whenever there is a scarcity of labour in any profession. America, for example, was built up because it could not get all the labour it required. Machinery had to be used. If we cannot obtain the labour we need, we must do likewise.<br><br>
If we are to multiply the number of teachers we now have in our schools, but if we are unable to do so through recruiting, we shall have to use science by way of closed circuit television, film script lectures by the best teachers, and so on. Methods of doing this are available, but insufficient use is made of them. It is at least thirty years since I first learned that the best way of teaching economics was to put the matter on the blackboard, while the worst way was to scribble in chalk on the blackboard in the middle of a lecture. If this information is on films, slides and other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
mechanical aids the work can be done with the least amount of labour and, at the same time, the best use of skilled labour can be made.<br><br>
If in Glasgow—and I understand that in Fife experiments are also being conducted into these methods of teaching—and in Edinburgh a success can be made of closed circuit television teaching and other scientific means of learning, it means that the best teachers can expound their subjects to the largest number of people. There is no reason why, in the ordinary school, a teacher should not explain the subject just as well to 600 students as to 60. If a lecture is given to a university class of a couple of hundred students, they all hear it at the same time, just as well as if they were in classes of 60. Having explained the subject or given a lecture, the teacher can then go on to the task of teaching, for the tutorial work is a completely separate concept.<br><br>
I urge the Secretary of State urgently to consider the whole question of the modernisation of teaching. I am sure that this applies to universities as well as ordinary schools. Incidentally, I understand that in some cases university students find it easier to obtain the notes on certain lectures from previous students in order to know exactly what the professor has said. All these things should be brought up to date and, if our universities and schools are to teach science properly, they should get down to the planned use of it.<br><br>
I have a great respect for teachers. I know and have known a great many of them and I respect the work they do. We should not pander to any depreciation of the profession; this continuous writing it down. By the time those who depreciate it have finished one might get the feeling that it is not a profession worth going into. That applies equally to the medical profession.<br><br>
Consider, for example, the pay of teachers and doctors. I have a friend who is a doctor. He spent about seven years qualifying to become a great doctor. While he was qualifying his fiancée, not wishing to be idle, decided to qualify to become a teacher. Within three years she was teaching and earning more than he was. This should be borne in mind when people say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
teachers are not members of a hard-driven profession or that they do not compare with young doctors struggling to qualify for their profession. It is worth remembering that in the case I cited the woman was earning while the man was still struggling to become a doctor.<br><br>
A great deal of romantic sentiment and exaggeration is often made over these things and I hope that the Secretary of State will see that the Teaching Council gets down to the brass tacks of this. The Council should see that these matters are dealt with in a businesslike and scientific way and that the ideas, thoughts, discussions and decisions on education are devoted not only to the conditions which surround the subject but to the children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill, and I am pleased to speak in the debate following the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) because he has drawn attention to an important aspect of teaching, the vocational aspect. We must not in discussing teaching lose sight of the fact that there is this vocational aspect. This aspect is most important when considering the status of the profession, and as long as we can maintain this aspect we shall, I hope, not look upon teaching as we might look upon many other jobs. However, merely because the profession has this vocational aspect, is no reason why teachers should be denied the kind of status other professions have. For this reason, in particular, I welcome the Bill. If the Measure succeeds in raising the status of the profession and if, at the same time, it contributes towards meeting the teacher shortage in Scotland, a great deal will have been achieved by it.<br><br>
Much time has been spent in the debate so far in discussing the status of teachers and their rights. We must also consider the wider aspects involved, particularly the fact that if education in Scotland as a whole is to benefit we must consider what contribution the Bill and the Teaching Council will make to those who are being taught. Some hon. Members have spoken about this, but mainly only in passing. That is why we must particularly consider the composition of the Teaching Council, for it is important that all interests in education,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
not merely the interests of the teachers, are represented.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) stated particularly clearly the case for the representation of the Churches, the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church. She mentioned the important part which the Churches have played in pioneering education in Scotland and the tremendous historical association they have with education. This was acknowledged by the Secretary of State. While acknowledging this historical association, we must also consider the contribution which the Churches can make towards education. The Churches view education not from any single point of view, teaching or otherwise, for they are concerned with education in its widest and fullest sense. It is in this sense that we should consider the Bill. That is why it is important that the Government should consider giving specific representation to the Churches on the Teaching Council, for in this way education in its widest sense will be kept in mind.<br><br>
The Wheatley Committee contrasted in its Report the teaching profession with other professions, including the medical profession and the legal bodies. It pointed out that the teaching profession existed largely of employed persons, while the others consist mainly of self-employed people. That gave rise to the recommendation in paragraph 88 of its Report in relation to the representation of education authorities. Here I endorse what was said by the hon. Member for Bothwell (Mr. James Hamilton), for there is a strong case for the specific representation of education authorities on the Council. I know that the Wheatley Committee recommended that this should be done through the Association of County Councils and the Association of Counties of Cities, but I should have thought that representatives of education committees and authorities would have first-hand knowledge of the matters under discussion. I hope, therefore, that the representatives on the Teaching Council will be members of education authorities, because they are more concerned with the wider aspects of education, not only as employers but in all other ways, and, as such, they are able to make a valuable contribution to the work of the Council.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
I turn to Clause 11 of the Bill and the disciplinary provisions. The Disciplinary Committee will have power to remove a teacher from the Teaching Council when a teacher is convicted of a criminal offence or is guilty of infamous conduct. What will happen in the case of a teacher becoming negligent or incompetent in his or her duties? This might happen, for example for medical reasons. Education authorities are faced from time to time with extremely difficult cases in which they have to deal with a teacher in such a situation as that, and they would be tremendously assisted if the Council were able to offer them some support<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Whilst we acknowlege that this Bill blazes a new trail in the teaching profession and, at the same time, maintains the need in Scotland to set an example to England, I hope that we maintain and advance the quality and good reputation and name of Scottish education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Pioneers in politics deserve well of their contemporaries, and by grasping what is admittedly an educational nettle my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has, in a sense, recreated a nineteenth-century situation in which the eyes of educationists in England, and in Europe, are looking once more towards Scotland for an example. All credit to him, to his Ministers, and to his team of civil servants—and, I think, particularly to a British Cabinet which has encouraged the experiment without saying, "You must not get out of step with English educational practice." Amongst other things, the establishment of a Teachers' Council represents the Labour Government's good faith to their pledge to cater for Scotland's needs through the eyes of Edinburgh and not of London.<br><br>
I just wonder whether any hon. Member opposite would care to deny that a major consideration in the refusal of the last Government to implement Wheatley came from a feeling, "We must not do anything that would embarrass Curzon Street". I am very willing to give way to any hon. Member opposite who wishes to reply? So I can only assume that I am right in what I say. That attitude created a situation in which for the last thirteen years
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
Scotland has been hanging on, in this sense, to England's coat-tails. I am glad to see that that situation has come to an end.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in his remarks about the Churches. During the last ten days I have been on the telephone to Dr. Bigwood, the Convener of the Church of Scotland Education Committee, and also to the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Glasgow. They feel that they have a special relationship that is not adequately catered for, and that sympathetic consideration should be given to them.<br><br>
However, one's critical faculties are not lulled by becoming a member of the Government party, and I must say to the hon. Lady that I am frankly critical of the Secretary of State's refusal in Clause 7 to endorse Wheatley on the proposal for the use of the affirmative resolution procedure. Moreover, I see this as a matter of substance, and not merely an academic question of parliamentary mechanics. It is something worth talking about, rather than being a minor detail, the Secretary of State may feel that he is covered by the well-intentioned palliative of an obligation to publish the Council's dissent. But I disagree.<br><br>
The most concise and eloquent expression of the general case for the affirmative resolution procedure was put on 27th March, 1962, when an Amendment was moved to the Housing (Scotland) Bill. It was then said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our suggestion is that before such an order should take effect it would be appropriate, in this case, to subject it to the affirmative procedure of the House of Commons. That would mean that instead of such an order being made without any examination by any authority at all … it would come before Parliament. This new power is far too important to be exercised in any other way, and an order made under it should be considered by the House of Commons. Admittedly, there must be a certain measure of dissatisfaction about using the affirmative procedure because that would mean that we could only examine the order and discuss it, and either reject it or accept it. We could not amend it. Nevertheless, the main thing is that the Secretary of State would not have the last say. He would have to justify, before the bar of public opinion and before the House of Commons what he proposed to do."</p></blockquote>
It is not difficult there to recognise the crisp phrasing of my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross).
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
My right hon. Friend, in a previous incarnation, went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The whole point is that once this scheme has been drawn up in St. Andrew's House and signed by the Secretary of State it is bound to become the pattern for the whole of Scotland. We therefore suggest that we should not delegate such an important power to the Secretary of State and tell him just to get on with it. If we give him that power and then object to his use of it, we say that he should vindicate his action before the House of Commons."</p></blockquote>
Then we have some truly vintage stuff from my right hon. Friend:
<br><blockquote><p>"Let the whole House of Commons know of it and debate it. Let the whole of Scotland know of it. Let it not just be something appearing in the columns of the <i>Scotsman</i> or the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> one morning as the law."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 27th March, 1962; c. 1017.]</p></blockquote>
I am glad that my right hon. Friend said that, because I have to face up to a question that, among other questions, he might very well be justified in putting. He might well say to me, "Is the affirmative resolution procedure, which might well have been correct had it been incorporated in the 1962 Housing Bill, appropriate to the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill, 1965?" I do not wish to be dogmatic, because my right hon. Friend argued a powerful case, but, on balance, I think that the answer is "Yes", and for the following reasons.<br><br>
In the mind of the Wheatley Committee, Secretaries of State for Scotland, whoever they are, are only human, and no man likes reversing a policy once it has been introduced. None of us likes losing face. So, once something has been stated in public, up go the mental barricades, and we sink into the deepest of all prejudices, those of the mind. Even though there are qualifications, for which we give the Secretary of State credit, I think that the use of the negative resolution procedure introduces a rigidity which is alien to the subject matter likely to be discussed.<br><br>
To make teaching attractive, it is not sufficient just to legislate for the right measures. Style is important. How we do it is important. It seems to me that the use of the affirmative resolution procedure is in the direction of good style in Government, because it allows Scots to hammer out issues on the anvil of informed opinion, and that use of the negative procedure is in the direction of bad style, because it smacks of handing down received doctrine from on high.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
I agree that the Secretary of State is writing into the Bill proposed safeguards in relation to the Council, being required to publish a reasoned dissent, but he would probably agree that by the time that happens attitudes have already been struck, positions are already entrenched, and the molten metal of legislation is shaped and cooled. The purpose of my intervention is to ask that the proposals should come before Members of Parliament while the metal of legislation is still hot, and while it is still malleable, without the possibility of loss of face.<br><br>
There is to me a special reason why Scottish Measures should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The Secretary of State for Scotland has the widest range of jobs of any Cabinet Minister. Even with Under-Secretaries and Ministers of State, he cannot concentrate his attention in the same way as a United Kingdom Minister can. That is, I think, a further good reason why the Legislature should scrutinise his Orders with the extra vigilance afforded by the affirmative resolution procedure.<br><br>
My final doubt about the negative resolution procedure stems from its own history. Since 1941 the following Orders have been successfully prayed against—and I make no apology for going through this list, because it is highly relevant: Defence Regulation 42 BA, Sunday Opening of Theatres, 1st April, 1941; Order amending Regulation 42 CA of Defence Regulations, 18th December, 1945; Housing Rates of Interest, 25th July, 1950; Fats, Cheese and Tea (Rationing) (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1951, 9th April, 1951; Plaster Board Prices (No. 1) Order, 1951; Building Plasters (Prices) No. 1 Order, 1951, and Gypsum Rock (Prices) No. 1 Order, 1951, 5th July, 1951.<br><br>
I wonder whether my right hon. Friend will be at all sympathetic if I tentatively suggest that this is the sort of fiction and sham procedure of the House of Commons that led Professor Brian Chapman to write in his book "British Government Observer":
<br><blockquote><p>"One of the most noticeable features of British central Government is the extent to which Departments behave as if they were independent satrapies pursuing their own aims and pressing their own definitions of public policy against all comers, and not infrequently manipulated by the very pressure groups they are supposed to control."</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is only merit in my hon. Friend's argument if he can prove that the House of Commons, or Governments, have been more amenable to the overthrow of an affirmative resolution which he suggests. Can my hon. Friend tell me on how many occasions an affirmative resolution brought forward by the Government, any Government, has been overthrown?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, because the affirmative procedure has been a very in frequent one. Nevertheless, it is vital to the health of Parliament that it should be used more, precisely because Governments would not have to be overthrown, This is the central issue in our discussion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the affirmative resolution procedure there is no need for Governments to lose face.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised a very important point. I agree that, ideally, it is better in legislation to have an affirmative resolution and a discussion, but there is a limit to the time of the House of Commons. The subject may be all agreed, and there may be no controversy, but would not my hon. Friend agree that time would necessarily have to be taken up with an affirmative resolution, perhaps to the exclusion of the consideration of other urgent Scottish legislation which could have been dealt with in the time lost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be glib, but, surely, for matters of substance time can be found. I think that the question of the lack of parliamentary time is a bit fictional in relation to matters of serious substance. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) has great experience in these matters, but I also know that he will consider the view of a relative newcomer.<br><br>
I see this question of affirmative and negative resolutions as part of the conflict between a busy Secretary of State and a St. Andrew's House which is seen by the people of Scotland to be an institution which does things to people—certainly, for the best reasons—and, on the other hand, the elected Members of Par-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
liament assembled in the Scottish Grand Committee and representing the Scottish people.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I was impressed by a phrase used by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) in another context three years ago when he spoke of
<br><blockquote><p>"The tremendous enthusiasm for enforcing the will of the Scottish Office upon the Scottish Standing Committee and on the Scottish people".</p></blockquote>
That was his opinion three years ago and there are dangers in that whatever party is in power.<br><br>
On Tuesday, the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It may be that we shall have to look at it again in Committee, but to my mind this is a satisfactory, adjusted balance of the responsibilities which are to be borne."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 2nd February, 1965; c. 18.]</p></blockquote>
It would not be reasonable to expect any decision from my hon. Friend the Member for Lanark (Mrs. Hart) in her winding-up speech this morning, but I hope that in Committee my right hon. Friend, whom I have always deeply respected, apart from any party reasons, as an anti-authoritarian upholder of individual rights, will say to himself that, even if it is inconvenient for the Scottish Office, he will not rate Members of the Scottish Grand Committee so low that he will ask them to be rubber stamps. By introducing the affirmative resolution procedure, he will have little if anything to lose, and quite a lot to gain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the pleasure of attending the Committee on Tuesday but I have carefully read the report of the debate on that day. One thing which confuses me is the precise significance of the Bill's powers. We have had various comments about it. The Secretary of State said that control of entry into the teaching profession, which is now exercised by the Secretary of State, is to pass largely to the profession. The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) said that the eyes of Europe were upon us, and it was apparent that he regarded this as a significant piece of legislation. On the other hand, we have had contributions from various organisations, including the E.I.S., always glad to give us its opinions, which have written to say that the Bill closely follows the Wheatley Report.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
My impression of the Bill is different. The Wheatley Report suggested that the Council should have few real powers, but the Bill does not even propose most of those. The Bill is diluted Wheatley and nothing much more. The use of the negative or affirmatvie resolution procedure has already been discussed and I will not go into that further, but there are three other changes of significance which we should not allow to pass without comment.<br><br>
The first and perhaps the most significant is the recommendation in paragraph 103 of the Wheatley Report which the Bill seems to have dramatically changed. Paragraph 103 explains that the initiative in matters of entrance qualifications at present lies with the Secretary of State. This paragraph is one of the Report's main recommendations, for it says that there should be a change if the Teaching Council is to have any teeth and any real status. It recommends the substantial change that instead of proposals being produced by the Government and referred to the teachers for comment, proposals should emanate from the Council itself. The Government do not appear to have accepted that recommendation, because the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum says that the Secretary of State is to be empowered to make regulations for the education and training of teachers on his own initiative. It is clear that this major suggestion has been overborne.<br><br>
However, other important teeth have been removed by the Bill. Several hon. Members have made great play with the subject of registration. It is suggested that this is an entirely new development which will give the Council real power, but this power is to consist only of licensing teachers, although the Council will have to accept without question students recommended by colleges of education. The Bill lays down four categories who are to be entitled to be registered, so that it is not a question of selection and the Council will have little, if any, scope in this respect.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) pointed out that the Bill does not specify that only those who are registered will be able to teach. Far be it from me to suggest that that should be the position, but we have to appreciate precisely what the Bill does. There has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
been a conflict of opinion between those who want to know what the Bill does and the Government who want the teachers to think that it does certain things.<br><br>
The one important power, if it is a power, which the Bill contains concerns discipline. This is something with which the Secretary of State would not like to concern himself and it is something which local authorities are not empowered to deal with on their own initiative, but the subject of professional incompetence does not even appear to come within the scope of the provisions governing the rules of discipline.<br><br>
There are very few powers in the Bill and the Teaching Council will almost certainly be an advisory committee and precious little else. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that on Tuesday the right hon. Gentleman should have concentrated on the subject of the teacher shortage and the difficulties of preparing to meet the raising of the school-leaving age in 1970.<br><br>
There are many who doubt the practicability of raising the school-leaving age by 1970 and there may be some who, like myself, doubt the desirability. However, there is no question but that the only way in which to achieve it and to get the teachers necessary is to have a measure of dilution and the entry of male non-graduates into the teaching profession. With the increased number of children taking advanced education and going forward for fifth and sixth-year courses, it is impossible with present arrangements to raise the school-leaving age by 1970 unless there is a measure of dilution.<br><br>
It is rather dangerous that the Bill should allow so much consultation, and although the Secretary of State himself will not believe the Council to have much power, he will be anxious to maintain the Council's good will, at least in the initial years of its operation. Setting up the Council will completely wipe out the possibility of introducing male non-graduate teachers in Scotland, for I find it difficult to believe that a body more than half of which is teachers will accept recommendations from the Secretary of State on that subject.<br><br>
It is suggested that the Council will help in improving the status of teachers. I fully accept that the status of teachers may not be as high as it should be, nor as high as would be good for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
country, but there are several reasons for that. Giving power to teachers to register themselves in colleges and giving them the power to comment on regulations initiated by the Secretary of State will not improve their status. What are the reasons for the low status of teachers? Having been in a university myself recently and having been advised by those who taught in universities that if I had a poor degree and was not successful, I could always become a teacher, I can say that this is precisely the reason why the status of teachers tends to be low.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, why does the hon. Gentleman think that dilution would help to solve the problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to explain that unless we have dilution we shall not be able to raise the school-leaving age by 1970. That is a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were at that moment talking about status and not about numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course status and solving a physical problem are different matters. Status would not be materially affected by the introduction of male non-graduate teachers, although the status of graduate teachers would certainly be raised.<br><br>
There are other reasons for the low status. We cannot ignore the fact that in recent years teachers have tended to indulge in what might be called industrial tactics when pressing their claims for advancement. That is the fault not of the teachers but of previous Governments and of society in not offering them fair rewards in the first place. Perhaps the teachers have been forced to indulge in these tactics, but that has contributed to a lowering of their status.<br><br>
We have also to consider the promotional structure of the profession. There is no doubt that high status can be gained by those in other professions where ability is given its proper reward. My experience in local government and the schools has been that teaching ability is not given its fair reward. Far too many local authorities operate promotion systems entirely on length of service and not on the ability or success of the individual. If we had a system in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
which the teacher of enormous ability, or the teacher who had proved himself, could gain rapid promotion and the salary to which that promotion entitled him at an early age, the status of the profession would be improved. I very much doubt whether we shall attract the best graduates, or the best potential teachers, unless we are prepared to organise the profession so that ability is given its fair reward.<br><br>
There are two other changes which I should like the Secretary of State to allow. The first concerns the group of people who, on grounds of conscience, object to registering with their profession, or to exercising their voting rights. There are many teachers, some of them in my constituency, who would feel it impossible to register or to exercise their voting rights, and while we appreciate that the Bill itself will not add to the number of teachers in Scotland, I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is anxious that it should not reduce the number, as it now may. As in other professions, people may be lost to teaching if registration is made compulsory for those who have conscientious objections to it.<br><br>
The second charge is more serious and has been mentioned by almost every speaker in the debate. It is the subject of Church representation. Many have suggested that we should have Church representation because the Churches are entitled to a place for historical reasons, but there are far more significant reasons. The education systems in Scotland and England, particularly for religious instruction, are quite different. In Scotland, because of the difficulties in the Churches in the past, the Secretary of State, the Scottish Education Department and the Inspectorate have little if any control over religious instruction in schools, unless it is being used to promote matters dissociated from religious teaching.<br><br>
For example, the Scottish Education Department gives no guidance on the teaching of religious instruction. The responsibility for ensuring that religious instruction is given in the schools rests entirely with the local authorities, and even they have no statutory right to allow time for it in school syllabuses. If religious instruction is given, a certain procedure has to be gone through if it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
to be discontinued, but the local authorities are not bound to allow it.<br><br>
Religious instruction in Scottish schools is not inspected in any way and under Section 67(2) of the Education Scotland Act, 1962, the Inspectorate is actually forbidden to go into schools and inspect religious instruction. It is not examined in any way and here, again, the law forbids such examination. Finally, teachers have to contract out of giving religious instruction instead of, as should be the case, contracting in.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is excluded from from any oversight of religious instruction in schools. There can be no provision in the teacher-training regulations for the training of teachers in religious instruction simply because the Secretary of State has no control over its teaching in the schools. The result of this situation is that the position in Scotland is much worse than the position in England, and for that reason it is more than ever essential not only that the Churches should be represented but that they should play a full part in education.<br><br>
In England the situation is quite different. The Inspectorate has responsibility for ensuring that religious instruction is provided in State schools. In 1963 in England 72,000 candidates were presented for O levels in religious knowledge and 41,000 passed, and 3,500 went forward for A levels of whom 2,200 passed. Compared with that, less than one dozen schools in the whole of Scotland put forward children for G.C.E. examination in religious knowledge. This is an unsatisfactory situation. I feel that it would be better if religious instruction were not given at all than that it should be done in the way it is done in the Scottish schools.<br><br>
This is a vital subject and there should be far more guidance and even direction from the Scottish Education Department. The law should be changed, but till it is changed or such changes are envisaged it would be criminal for us not to allow teachers and all other branches of the Scottish way of life, particularly the Churches, to be fully represented on this Teaching Council. Unless the Secretary of State has in mind to change control of religious education and instruction I hope that he will allow full representation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
and participation by the Churches in the Teaching Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) was quite wrong in his interpretation in the early part of his speech of what powers appear or do not appear in the Bill. One point which he made, about which I was sorry as well as perturbed, was what he said when he recited his experience at Glasgow University in the matter of obtaining a good degree when he was told that, "Of course there is always teaching". This attitude has been prevalent for years and much of it remains among hon. Members opposite because of their lack of attention in the past to precisely this point.<br><br>
It is many years since all of us learned of the dangerous trend in recruitment and the production of teachers. There have been numerous Reports, including the Plowden Report, the Knox interim Report and full Report, but inaction has been the word of the day. I agree with the hon. Member when he said at one stage of his speech that perhaps it is our fault that society has not determined the priorities properly. Unless we get proper teaching in the primary and secondary schools our hopes of producing the necessary number of pupils to go to university and become graduates and perhaps themselves teachers will come to an end.<br><br>
I was interested in what my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodbum) said, and I should like to say a few words of commendation. My right hon. Friend has been supposed to be by some people a "has been" but the ideas were still bubbling out. He mentioned the experience of a doctor friend and his wife who went out to teach and then found that she was earning more than he was. This is part of the trouble, and at a lower echelon it is not unusual for pupils to leave what used to be called the junior school at 15 or 16 years of age and in a year or two to be earning more than their former teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Member think we can direct the best graduates to teaching if promotion is based on seniority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. The hon. Member must try to keep himself informed on these matters before making his speeches.<br><br>

I welcome the Bill. A fundamental point has been missed in this debate. It was at the time of the one-day strike in Glasgow that the schools were the worst recruiting places for the profession and hon. Members opposite were successful in uniting the teachers in their disapproval of what was then going on. It was after that that Viscount Muirshiel appointed a committee in 1961 which reported in 1963. Despite repeated representations to the then Government they stalled and did not introduce the necessary Bill.<br><br>
It was pointed out even then that the present Bill was necessary if the Robbins Committee proposals were to be put into operation at all. The fact is that the teaching profession has agreed to a large measure of dilution. Teachers of commercial subjects and instructors in music, for example, are all men teachers who are non-graduates. The Robbins proposal was to provide a four-year training course at the colleges for men and women in conjunction with the universities, but hon. Members opposite did not seem to be apprised of the full urgency of the situation and they kept delaying introducing the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State deserves the congratulations not only of the Committee but of the whole of Scotland that this is the first time that this has been done in the history of out nation.<br><br>
There is a growing number of un-certificated teachers, and with the best will in the world I cannot agree with my hon. Friends. A teacher, unfortunately, said to me only this week that the best way for a teacher to find out whether he can teach is to get up in front of a class. He would then know whether or not he could do the job. This is a dreadful attitude. The profession is as skilled a profession as any other. It is not only a matter of having the knowledge but of having the skill in the imparting of that knowledge and in so interesting a child that the child responds, and, perhaps, eventually himself becomes a teacher.<br><br>
This was the background and the atmosphere in which the Wheatley Committee was appointed, and it was at that time that the Government were talking about the "vocation" of nurses and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
teachers. All these jobs are "vocations". This is an excuse for the failure of society, and not only the Government of the day, to ascertain and lay down the priorities in a proper fashion.<br><br>
The Government of that day could not understand or explain how it had come about that a respectable, responsible educated body of men and women acted in the way they did. It was not at that time merely a question of salary. The resentment which these people felt was explained by the profoundly important fact that it was a crisis of confidence because of the lack of consultation in matters which were of immense importance to teachers. They resented the feeling that decisions were being made in the remote fastnesses of the Scottish Education Department and that the whole question of partnership with their public employers in the public service had been completely missed.<br><br>
This is the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson). There is a partnership in the law, and in medicine, though it may not be ideal. We may not be able to question that partnership as much as we would wish, but at least it exists. It did not exist between the profession and the employers in this public service. I profoundly believe that the Bill will go a long way to establish that partnership.<br><br>
Teachers will have far greater responsibility for their own affairs as a result of the Bill. The assumption of responsibility not in name only but by being involved in making and carrying out decisions is the key and essence of what the Bill is intended to do. Where that responsibility is absent it is easy to have missed the essentials of the whole case, and for some years now teachers in their staff rooms have not been the best recruiting agents for their own profession. I agree that the matter of crying stinking fish has done immeasurable harm. The Bill will go some way to rectify that situation.<br><br>
One of the most important matters affecting teachers is that the image which the teacher projects in the classroom is vitally important for the future of recruiting. Children respond almost instantly by either liking or disliking a new teacher, and that impression will prevail for a long time. Teachers too often forget that they are under almost constant scrutiny
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
and critical examination by the young people who sit in front of them. The teacher who uses sarcasm is loathed and the one who tends to give praise now and again is loved and idolised.<br><br>
I believe that the teacher who is devoted not only to education in a wide sense but also to skilled teaching as such can by his example in the classroom do more than he probably recognises himself to stimulate others to emulate him. When we hear of people in university quadrangles buttonholing young people and trying to persuade them to join this or that firm I say, quite deliberately, that teachers have the first opportunity to persuade and guide and encourage our young people towards the teaching profession.<br><br>
Teachers form the largest factor and most important resource in education. I know that this is a matter of emphasis. I do not suggest that we should have no new buildings or should not put in more resources into equipment, but I believe that the production of teachers comes first. The good teacher will adapt barns and disused buildings and in the process of education will encourage and cooperate with children in transforming the premises.<br><br>
I am glad to see that the Secretary of State is still retaining the ultimate power to make the final decision. I think that the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) made this point well in her contribution, that the Secretary of State, as representing the public interest, should have the final decision in these matters.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) only went so far in his remarks as to agree in essence with this case. I hope that my right hon. Friend will look again at the matter of the affirmative regulation. I think I know the problem. I would say to my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian the difficulty is whether the regulations should be determined by the solution of the problem which the Bill sets out to deal with, or should be merely based on whether there is a disagreement or not.<br><br>
The merits of whether it should be negative or affirmative procedure would be wrongly determined simply on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
basis of whether there is a disagreement between the Council and the Secretary of State. I think that the decision about what kind of regulations should be introduced should be based on the merits of the Bill itself and the problems which it is designed to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is to determine whether a subject is important or not? This is purely value judgment. Some may say that housing is more important than education; others may take the opposite view. I think this is a very tricky balance of values.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the essence of the problem. In these matters it is, at the end of the day, bound to be the Secretary of State for Scotland who decides in the public interest, because there may be cases where he may think that even the Teachers Council is wrong in its approach or in what it wants to do. If that is so, he has to make a decision, and he is accountable to the House for his decision.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have talked about this Bill conferring status upon the teachers. I think that this is the wrong attitude. Status is not conferred. Teachers have always had status. What was wrong was that we did not recognise it fully and give it its proper place in the community. I do not want to pursue that, but I do want to take up the point made by my hon. Friend and other hon. Members of the Committee who have been talking about the recruitment of teachers. The best source in the short term is to try to find out where the retired teachers are. On this question of a register, it would be interesting to know whether there is at present a full register where all the names and addresses of teachers can be found. I know headmasters in the City of Glasgow who are doing doorstep canvassing in order to try to build up their staff themselves. This is a lamentable situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member agree that the problem is not so much to find the retired teacher as the disincentive of losing his pension if he goes back?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know this point. This was one of the recommendations made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
as far back as 1958 by the Knox Committee who viewed it almost as an emergency measure.<br><br>
Looking at some of these advertisements over the weekend, I found that there are teachers going into the Armed Forces as young men and retiring after 16 years in the Armed Forces with a pension of £450 who can then go into teaching. But a teacher coming out of the profession—he can take a job as janitor in a school, or as a lavatory attendant; he may get a job anywhere; but what he must not do is to continue in the school as a teacher. I agree thoroughly with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart that we do not have our priorities right. I was glad to hear my right hon. Friend say that some of these questions are being looked at again.<br><br>
I conclude with one other suggestion to my right hon. Friend. It follows from a speech made by a lady who has now retired, one of the medical officers in Glasgow, Dr. Wattie, who, in talking about the difficulty of recruiting nursing staff, pointed out the salient fact that young people are marrying earlier—at the ages of 18, 19 or 20. Some of them are the very women whom we are talking about, the young women who are going through the training college, who do their teaching and then marry and have families and so are out of teaching. When their families, in turn, have grown up to the ages of 18, 19 or 20, they are themselves still only at the age of 40, 41 or 42 with twelve, thirteen or fourteen years' good teaching experience available to fill this gap. Instead of looking so much at those aged 20 or 21, can we not project our thoughts? Is this to be the pattern for the future, and if so, can we do something about it?<br><br>
I commend what my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire said about television. Glasgow is to be commended on this, but something should be pointed out. The new university of Strathclyde has also built up a magnificent system whereby the lecturers are now talking to numerous students at once—I do not know the exact number, but far more than they were able to talk to at once until recent times.<br><br>
I commend this Bill. I am happy about it, and I feel very confident that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
will go a long way towards resolving some of the problems which have recently confronted us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start by congratulating you, Mr. Brewis, on this, the first occasion—if not the first day—on which you have taken the Chair at our meetings.—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]—I think it is not unfair, and I hope that you will not think it unkind, if I say that your natural courtesy as well as the rather wide subject matter of this Bill have allowed you to give us perhaps rather wider scope than many of us thought possible when the debate started.<br><br>
I should like to follow that by saying my word of thanks to Lord Wheatley and his Committee for the task which they did. I think that the discussions which we have had during the last two mornings in this Committee have shown quite clearly the sort of problems which Lord Wheatley and his Committee had to iron out, to balance the desires of one body against the wishes of another. The fact that he achieved unanimity is a very great credit to him and to the people who served on that Committee, because indeed, such unanimity—although I know that we have been at it only for two mornings—is still clearly a good way off in our own Committee here.<br><br>
It was interesting and, I thought, right that the hon. Gentlemen the Members for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) and Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) should bring out the particular points of view which each expressed about their worry about restrictive practices, not only in their own unions but also in the professions. Indeed, the professions, as many people have said, can build up stronger and more powerful restrictive practices than are found almost anywhere else. I am not certain that we as Members of Parliament are entirely free from this. I am certain, too, that, in his opening speech, the Secretary of State was absolutely right-as was the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) and many other people who have commented on this, including the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir)—in maintaining his statutory responsibility for the final decision. I am grateful to him, as I was grateful to a former Secretary of State, who is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0127">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
by no means a "has been," as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill, suggested some people thought, for the kind things which they said about the progress which has been made under our party in helping both the status of teachers—which I think was a point made by the Secretary of State—and about the progress in schools and salaries, which was a point made by the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn). I am delighted that we have pioneered this Bill in Scotland and I think that it is an important one. I am not quite certain that I would go so far as the present Secretary of State and say that it is the central part of all our problems in education. I should like to go on to perhaps one or two others later in my speech, as well as some of the points which he made.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State who is to wind up will—although I know it is difficult in advance to make any sort of commitments—be able to tell us something about what is in the minds of herself and her right hon. Friend about the nomination of the six extra members of the Council. Many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have spoken about the importance of the Churches in representing their particular views to the Council. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that if this Council is to be effective it has to be a Council not just of delegates but of people responsible in their own right. While I accept that, I do not altogether accept his view that, if he took all the people who had applied for representation on the Council, it would be put up from 44 to 78. I am certain there would be quite a percentage of the 78 who would not automatically find themselves there. But I do think that there is a special case for the Church of Scotland. I think that there may also be a good case for some representation from the Roman Catholic Church. I am quite prepared to be convinced, if the Secretary of State will give us an assurance, that this is his intention, accepting that he will do it in good faith and accepting that Secretaries of State who follow will have the same viewpoint. If he cannot do that, then I think we may have to put down an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
Amendment in order to clarify the position and see where we are going.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Paisley spoke with a great deal of force about the importance in our teaching profession—perhaps increasing in the years to come—of industrial experience. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) was, perhaps, a little too pessimistic about the possibilities of getting effective teachers if we were competing with industry. It is certain, with the new thinking on education which I know has been going on in Scotland as a whole and in the Scottish Office, that there will be a good deal more emphasis on some of the technical sides of education and people with industrial experience will be wanted.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
If I read the Bill aright, I imagine that under Clause 6(2,<i>c</i>) the Secretary of State can bring in people with industrial experience and expertise and, perhaps, without any other academic qualification, if he thinks that is necessary. I consider, in this connection, that the hon. Member for the Western Isles was right in believing that there is scope for some combination with industry to achieve the specialist teachers we need. Industry is today changing fast, too, and most industrialists I have met in Scotland during the last few years are every bit as aware as we are of the importance of skills in our work-people in Scotland in the future. So I believe that there could be a fertile source at least of part-time assistants in some subjects.<br><br>
I believe it also possible that we may have to revise in the period between now and 1975—which everyone realises will be difficult in teacher supply—some of our ideas about the age limit at which people can come into the teaching profession. We appreciate that there are a great many people who, for one reason or another, become redundant in their jobs between the ages of 48 and 50 and that it is difficult for many of them to get suitable alternative work. There is a potential source of useful teachers here, particularly on the technical side.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, West seemed to be in some conflict with his hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) because while the hon. Member for Renfrew, West thought
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
that the Teaching Council had not got nearly enough teachers on it, the hon. Member for Dundee, West said that the Council would be "overloaded with teachers to a colossal extent". I do not know which of these two views finds most favour in this Committee, but on the benches opposite it is possible to see a certain overloading with teachers, not that that is necessarily a bad thing.<br><br>
I was a little worried, appreciating the expertise in this matter of the hon. Member for Renfrew West when he said that it often took 16 or 17 years to give a teacher sufficient expertise to do his job properly. Such a length of time is, perhaps, beyond the range of most of us because we all know that in present circumstances our greatest difficulty is not the number of people coming into the profession but the number leaving it after only two or three years, sometimes less. I agree that these people are not teachers in the fullest and highest sense, although many of them have been doing very useful work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the shortage in our schools; that we are not recruiting sufficient people from our schools into the profession. I pointed out that a teacher learns his skill from the earliest age, between the years of 5 and 18, as well as at the time of graduation. I was not thinking of training after the person had become a teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that because I did not really believe that the hon. Gentleman meant that it should take 16 or 17 years to train a teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It takes a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will leave that subject there and congratulate the two hon. Members who made their maiden Committee speeches, the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) and the hon. Member for Bothwell (Mr. James Hamilton). In many a maiden speech on the Floor of the House it is common for the hon. Member to give his own constituency a boost and say what a wonderful place it is. The hon. Member for Bothwell took this opportunity of doing a little advertising for the trade union movement, and I hope that he may get a few extra paid up recruits as a result. He also brought out forcefully one of the main issues which has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
been moving about under the surface of this discussion—whether or not in future we should be thinking of an extension—and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill made this point fairly—of non-graduate men in our schools.<br><br>
I found, and I am sure that the present Secretary of State has also found, that when one talks to people skilled and knowledgeable in education matters in Scotland there is a wider understanding of this problem and not such a firm rejection of the possibility of movement as there has sometimes been in the past. I hope that nothing will be said in this Committee to attempt to crystallise the position, so that it becomes impossible for the teachers' associations to move in the way that I think we all realise there may have to be some changes in the near future.<br><br>
I am not certain that the hon. Gentleman the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) really wanted to suggest that the only reason why the Bill was not brought in during the last Session of Parliament was opposition from Curzon Street. I know that some of his friends were fairly close to Curzon Street at the time, and it may be that, in discussing these problems between different Members of a Government, different views are often taken. However, I do not think that Curzon Street would deny, either today or in the past, that if—if—we had in fact accepted the full recommendations of the Wheatley Committee it would not have been particularly happy, and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) pointed out that there had been some considerable departures from what one might call the full Wheatley. And they may indicate the means by which the right hon. Gentleman—who, I have no doubt, eloquently persuaded his opposite number in England that this was an admirable idea—persuaded them not to continue their opposition, if they were in opposition to the Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the right hon. Gentleman is in such a cheerful and puckish mood, would he let us into the secret of why he did not want, when he was in power, not to reject the Wheatley recommendation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why I did not want to reject it? I am afraid I do not understand the hon. Gentleman. I certainly did
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
not want to reject the Wheatley recommendation. If he will read the record of the discussions on this subject he will see that I have consistently said that I thought that most of the Wheatley recommendations were admirable. I will not go into great detail at this stage on any particular recommendations with which I did not entirely agree, but I certainly did not attempt to reject them.<br><br>
I turn to a few things said by the Secretary of State in his speech, mainly on the topic of teacher supply. With his customary courtesy, he described me as Michael the Silent and then objected because I had sat laughing during the speech of his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. That came rather oddly from someone who, for years, sat not just laughing but making sedentary and generally rude interruptions from the Front Bench opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seldom laughing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: However, I do not object. As the hon. Member for Renfrew, West said, when people progress from the shop floor to management attitudes tend to change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to bear in mind the point at which I began to laugh, I listened with great interest to the speeches made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern), the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Woodside (Mr. Carmichael). I listened with great attention to the beginning of the speech of the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary, and then she came to a splendid paragraph in which she said that
<br><blockquote><p>"my right hon. Friend and I have been giving very careful consideration to all this since we came into our present position. It is clear that this is the most urgent aspect of education in Scotland confronting us at present. It demands the greatest urgency …"</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman said yesterday that there was not a month to lose. The Under-Secretary went on until she was interrupted by her hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is very interesting … but will she … give us some suggestions about the ideas which she has in mind for curing this very difficult problem?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st February, 1965; Vol. 705, c. 856-7.]</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
I will not weary the Committee with further quotations from her speech, but if hon. Members would like to read it they will see that there were at least 15 platitudes which, I suppose, came from the Scottish Education Department. They must represent some of the best platitudes ever given a Minister to read out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were not read out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one followed another I thought that if one gave the speech to a school and asked the pupils to write a précis on it they could simply write, "This is a difficult problem and we are thinking about it."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon Gentleman will at least give me credit for my platitudes. They were not, as it happens, Scottish Education Department ones.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Lady how thankful I am that she has come clean about it, because I did not in the first place wish to impute that those platitudes were her own. I was afraid that someone in the Scottish Education Department had originated them and I am delighted to learn that that was not so.<br><br>
If these matters are so urgent, and if we cannot afford to lose a single month, why have not the Government taken action on them? Many of the points which hon. Members have made were made to me when I was Secretary of State. They have made exactly the same points now, particularly those concerning pay and pension considerations, salaries during the period of training and ideas of that sort. Since many hon. Members still say that these things should be done at once, and if it is not difficult for them to be done, surely, after four months, the Government might have managed to announce at least one of these things which, they say, were so simple to do when I was in office?<br><br>
The hon. Lady was not entirely responsible for this because her right hon. Friend was sitting beside her. I could not help wondering when the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill was making his speech and talking about the qualities of teachers—when he said that a teacher who used sarcasm was almost universally disliked—whether the Secretary of State had left the profession for that reason.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to join with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) in at least some of the things he said this morning, particularly in his congratulations to you, Mr. Brewis, for taking the Chair so smoothly at the Sittings of this Committee and in his congratulations to hon. Members who spoke for the first time in a Scottish Grand Committee, today or on Tuesday. From that point on he made some other remarks with which I agree, although my agreement does not extend to some of his later remarks.<br><br>
I found it difficult to understand why, if he takes the view that the measures we were discussing on how to solve the teacher shortage are so simple to take—and if he was apparently assured that this was so when he was in office—he did not take any of them. This seems to be rather a mystery—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—I have little time. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman can come back to this point at the end.<br><br>
During this morning I have been passed by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) a collection of poems produced by children who failed their second year in secondary school. One of these is, I think, particularly appropriate as a comment on the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. The title is "The Snail" and it reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Slowly moving, the snail</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Its feelers feeling for anything which may be protruding to hinder its progress</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Along the black, rough surface …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>No knowledge of the way, just slowly slipping along".</p></blockquote>
As I say, that could well be an appropriate description of the way in which the party opposite failed to take so many of the steps that we hope to take as fast as we can.<br><br>
A great many detailed points have been raised. I am very glad that the Bill has been so generally welcomed by both sides. It clearly deserves the warm comments that have been made on it. If I cannot deal with all those points this morning, I shall write to any hon. Members who particularly wish for comment.<br><br>
Turning to what are probably the two most important questions raised, there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
seems to have been a general recognition on both sides that what the Bill does is to give to teachers the professional control of the standards of entry to teaching and of other matters that are properly of professional concern to them, subject always to a recognition that the Secretary of State has a responsibility to Parliament for the education of children in Scotland. The Bill represents a reconciliation between the responsibilities of the Secretary of State, which he must maintain, and recognition that teachers, like the members of other professions, have a right to control matters of moment to their own profession.<br><br>
The point at which the Bill departs from the Wheatley recommendations, to which attention has been drawn both this morning and on Tuesday, concerns mainly the question of the affirmative or the negative procedure. I can well understand the doubts expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) and by many other hon. Members on this score. Naturally, one would wish to see the fullest possible opportunity in Parliament for exploration and criticism of any point on which there might be disagreement between the General Council and the Secretary of State. One does not expect that those occasions would often arise. One hopes that it would be very rare indeed that there would be disagreement between the two.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the difficulty which has not, I think, been fully understood, is that the Wheatley Committee, in paragraph 104 of its Report, recommended that where there was no disagreement the statutory regulations should be subject to the negative resolution procedure. It said, in other words, that there should be the negative procedure where there was agreement between the Council and the Secretary of State, and that only in the event of disagreement should there be resort to the affirmative resolution procedure. That would mean two types of procedure according to what was happening, outside the House, between the Secretary of State and the Council.<br><br>
There is a real constitutional and Parliamentary difficulty about that arrangement. If the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) goes back in her memory to occasions when we, in Opposition, urged the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
affirmative procedure, I do not think that she will remember an occasion when we urged that that procedure should be used because of something having been determined by a body outside the House. If the Wheatley recommendation were carried out as it stands, it would mean that the form of Parliamentary procedure to be used on a particular occasion would be dependent on whether or not an outside body agreed or disagreed with the Government. That would raise a rather new Parliamentary and constitutional point which is properly a question for this Committee and the House to decide. It is a Parliamentary point. The recommendation raises some very real difficulties which we feel were not taken fully into account by the Wheatley Committee. I think that Members of the Committee generally seem to agree that it is on that point alone that they are anxious, and there is no suggestion that fresh legislation should be a normal resort where any kind of difficulty arises.<br><br>
Another thing that has worried a great many people is the representation of the Churches on the Council. As the Bill has been drafted, there is no specific provision for their representation. I want to make it clear that the Wheatley Committee was very much aware of the interest of the Churches in teacher training, and suggested that the Secretary of State of the day would want to bear their claims in mind in making the appointment of the six members whom he would nominate under the proposed constitution. The Bill follows the Wheatley recommendations very closely on that point, and it is on that basis that my right hon. Friend has proceeded.<br><br>
He has, however, had representations that the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church should be assured in the Bill of a place on the Council. He has considered that representation carefully and has come to the conclusion that that can properly be achieved, without adding to the overall size of the Council and without unduly disturbing the pattern, by providing explicitly for Church representation and making a compensating reduction in the number of his own nominees. The position would then be the same at the end of the day, and this provision would be written into the Bill. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
Churches feel very strongly on this point, and we think that there will be no great difficulty in tabling a Government Amendment to this effect in Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) asked about the method of election of teacher members of the Council. I think that he will find paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 provides that the first election will be conducted by the Secretary of State amongst certificated teachers in the service, and subsequent elections by the Teaching Council under the electoral scheme which the Secretary of State will approve. The elections will be based on postal voting.<br><br>
The noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South asked about the development of courses of the kind recommended by the Robbins Committee, which lead to a university degree as well as a teaching qualification. The position is that both at Edinburgh and at Aberdeen plans are well advanced for the introduction of a degree course of this kind, probably from the beginning of next session. Progress has not been so rapid at Glasgow, but discussions between Jordanhill and the authorities at Glasgow University are continuing. There is not likely to be much progress at Dundee till the new independent university emerges—possibly in 1966, although no date has yet been settled.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian asked about the release of teachers from industry and commerce, and spoke of the need for an interchange of personnel between schools and industry. I think we all agree that this can be very useful, for further education particularly, and we shall certainly look at its possible extension in some school courses.<br><br>
The noble Lady and other hon. Members asked about the six members of the Council to be nominated by the Secretary of State—that number would now, of course, have to take account of those to be provided for the Churches. I should make it clear that the six members would not include the two assessors from the Scottish Education Department, who will be appointed by my right hon. Friend under paragraph 10 of Schedule 1. The Wheatley Committee suggested that, if possible, two officials should be appointed, but appreciated that this might be difficult.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0132">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
We do not think that such an arrangement is constitutionally desirable, but in choosing the members whom he will directly appoint my right hon. Friend will certainly wish to look at the many interests he will feel ought to be represented. He will certainly be looking at both sides of industry, and at the need to bring on to the Council uncommitted people with a broad knowledge, and will also consider whether there is a particular gap in the geographical spread in membership. These are factors which he will seek to take into account.<br><br>
Several hon. Members have mentioned disciplinary procedures. The Wheatley Committee looked at this subject very closely, and the Bill follows its recommendations in the context of the kind of conduct that is likely to concern the disciplinary committee. I do not think that the fines suggested of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) would be at all appropriate. What the Disciplinary Committee can do is to give a warning. It does not have to resort at once to extreme action. There is no reason why, in the kind of situation outlined by the hon. Member, resort to a warning should not be the step taken.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked what measures would be taken for teachers who were, as it were, falling down on their jobs. This is, and must be, a matter for the local authority as employer. The provisions of the Bill do not in any way prejudice the position of local authorities as employers, and this is, quite correctly, a matter for them to deal with.<br><br>
The noble Lady asked what was involved in the statement of reasons under Clause 7, and referred particularly to the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as he thinks fit"</p></blockquote>
in relation to that. Where a difference arises between the Secretary of State and the Council, and where not only the question of Parliamentary procedure arises but the need for the Secretary of State to publish his reasons for disagreement, if the occasion should ever arise to make necessary the use of that procedure we should expect to see the statement included in the circular which it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
is normal practice to publish at the same time as draft regulations are published. If it should ever happen that the Secretary of State was declining to act on the recommendation of the Council and there were no draft regulations to be issued, the statement would be published in a separate circular, or through Her Majesty's Stationery Office. That is the kind of thing we would expect would be done.<br><br>
I do not think that I have quite time enough left to deal with any more of the detailed points which have been put forward, and I would like just to return quite briefly to the relationship of this Bill to the problems facing the supply of teachers in Scotland. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) has quite rightly drawn attention to the needs of the less bright pupils—the Brunton-type pupils. Here it is important to give a couple of figures. Accepting the need for 4,000 extra teachers to meet the raising of the school-leaving age in 1970, a rough-and-ready breakdown shows that about 1,800 will be needed to teach the usual academic subjects, and about 2,200 to teach in the Brunton-type courses—the practical subjects, such as music, physical education, arts, homecrafts, handwork and all kinds of technical subjects.<br><br>
It is for teachers in such subjects as those that there will be an urgent need in 1970, and unless we can have the right kind of teacher we cannot give that kind of child what it is so important he should have. That means that we shall particularly face a shortage of, oddly enough, teachers in primary schools, because more girls entering teaching in the next few years will have to be encouraged into taking the practical homecraft type of course so that they do the Brunton-type teaching. That means that one of the very urgent things we have to look at is how to bring more men into the primary schools, because that is where the acute shortage will be.<br><br>
I am glad that the Committee has so warmly welcomed the Bill. I hope that I have answered some of the doubts and criticisms which have been voiced, but, if I have not, we can return to them at a later stage.</span></p>

Perhaps that would be a useful contribution to the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly look at that point closely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we conclude our proceedings, Mr. Brewis, I should like to express on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself—and, I am sure, the whole Committee—our appreciation of the services you have rendered to us

in this your first occupancy of the Chair in this Committee. It must have been rather a strain for you, I know, because I recollect very valued speeches you have made on this subject, not only in this Committee but in the House. I thought that when someone got on to the question of the need for male teachers we might have had a comment from the Chair, but I can assure you that your restraint was an example to us all, and I hope that the care and efficiency with which you have conducted your Chairmanship is a good indication for the future.</span></p>
