	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [4th March],</i> In page 11, line 8, leave out "25" and insert "27".—	<i>[Mr. Hendry.]</i></p>
	<p>10.33 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to apologise to the Committee that I am a few minutes late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be recollected that when we adjourned on Thursday of last week I was explaining a series of Amendments the principal effect of which would be to allow registered teachers serving in independent schools to be represented specifically on the Teaching Council, and one of my Amendments defined independent schools in a rather wider way than in their usual connotation. I sought to define them not only as purely independent schools but grant-aided schools as well. I was reminding the Committee that there are a great number of grant-aided schools providing education for some 20,000 boys and girls throughout Scotland. These schools have a very independent point of view in that they have a freedom to carry out experiments in educational methods and in providing special courses which are not normally provided by the State schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to go on to the purely independent schools of which there are a great many in Scotland—not fewer than 145 of all sorts and descriptions. Some of these schools are of world-wide fame, and some of them are little more than dame schools. I am not suggesting that all these schools should be represented but that registered teachers teaching in these schools should be represented because they have, like teachers in the grant-aided schools, a very individual point of view. Not only do many of these schools
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
make very serious experiments in educational methods but a great many are boarding schools and could bring to the counsels of the proposed Teaching Council a great deal of knowledge and experience relating to boarding schools in particular. It does seem to me that there is a case for teachers in independent schools, whether grant-aided or not, being represented on the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland may not find herself able to accept my Amendments as they are worded. It may be that she would prefer that teachers in boarding schools should be specially represented. Possibly she would agree to consider that teachers in grant-aided schools should be individually represented. That is a matter for her to consider, but I hope she will consider the general principle and idea of these Amendments, and if she cannot accept them as they are, that she will produce corresponding Amendments of her own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to thank the hon. Lady for the great courtesy and help which she and her officers have given me in my researches into this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to persuade the hon. Gentleman that the purpose he desires to achieve by his Amendment can already be achieved by the Bill. I would point out that there are certain immediate difficulties which arise from his Amendments in that, if they were accepted, the total membership of the Council would rise to 45, a net increase of one, and the provision of two additional places for teachers elected by the profession generally would upset the very carefully calculated balance of membership recommended by the Wheatley Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my main reply is that it is unnecessary to provide specifically for the election of teachers from independent and grant-aided schools. Primary schools and secondary schools, as they are referred to in the Bill and in this Schedule, include schools in these categories which are independent and grant-aided, so that were the teaching profession to choose to elect a primary school or secondary school teacher who taught in a grant-aided or independent school
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
there would be nothing to prevent it from doing so. For that reason I hope the hon. Gentleman can agree that there is no need for him to assume that the Bill would exclude the election of the teachers of the kind he mentions. I would not be happy to change the composition of the Council to include these schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Lady's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it might be convenient for the Committee if, with the next Amendment, No. 33, in the name of the Secretary of State, we took Amendments Nos. 34, 50, 51, 37 and 38. If that is not convenient we can take them separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly be for my convenience to take the Government Amendments, Nos. 33, 37 and 38 together, but I think perhaps the others, Nos. 34, 50 and 51, which stand in the name of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) might be considered separately in that they relate to a slightly separate point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So be it. I will call Amendment No. 33, and we can discuss Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 11, line 10, to leave out "13" and to insert "15".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said when winding up at Second Reading of the Bill, my right hon. Friend is very anxious to recognise the feeling of the Churches on the question or representation on the Council, and the purpose of this Amendment is to provide specifically for the representation on the General Teaching Council of the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church. The Amendments carry out the undertaking which I gave at Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision is at present made, as the Committee will know, for the representation of both Churches on the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers which will be wound up when this Council comes into being. The Amendments provide for the continued representation of both Churches within the central body concerned with training. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
fact that we did not provide specifically for Church representation on the Council stems from the Wheatley Report. Wheatley envisaged no representation of particular interests but expected that the Secretary of State would take account of the interest of the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church in making his own appointments, as indeed he would have done. But it is quite easy to make specific provision to give the Churches one member each by revising the number of the Secretary of State's appointments. These Amendments simply carry out the undertaking I gave, which I gather at the time had the general support of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 35 in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we took with it his Amendment No. 39, in page 11, line 20, after "persons" insert "being registered teachers".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 11, line 10, after "persons" to insert "being registered teachers."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position here is exactly as I have been saying since this Committee started—that this Teaching Council, being a professional body with great responsibilities towards the profession, should be confined to the profession itself. The Bill seeks to introduce on to the Council a considerable number of persons representative of various interests, including the Churches, and I am the first to agree that the Churches should be represented. It also seeks to introduce on to the Council representatives of the Association of Directors of Education, the universities of Scotland, the governing bodies of the central institutions, the colleges of education, further education centres, and so on. I can well see the wisdom of having all these interests represented on the Teaching Council, but this being a professional body I consider that the representatives of these bodies should in every case themselves be registered teachers. I think it is monstrous that we should set up a professional body and have on it outside representatives who are not members of the profession. I will not say any more because I feel that to do so would be tedious repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that equally apply to members nominated from local government authorities? Must they be registered teachers also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I forgot to mention the local government representatives. There is no reason why these should not be registered teachers, because in legislation passed either last year or the year before we made it possible for registered teachers to be members of the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) will realise that it is highly impractical to restrict those who may represent a local authority to persons who have qualified as teachers and who have become registered teachers for the purpose of the Bill. It is wholly impractical. How can it be reasonably argued that those who represent a local authority should have qualified themselves to be eligible to be registered as teachers? The hon. Gentleman is a great one for consistency and logicality. Therefore, there is no sense in trying to secure that two of three members should be so qualified when it would be impossible to obtain similar qualified membership from the other bodies which will be represented on the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) tell me where there is anything in the Bill which indicates that this should be a professional council? It is designated merely as a council. Is it just a belief that the hon. Gentleman has that it should be a professional body? During the course of our proceedings it has been frequently stated, at least from this side of the Committee, that this is a Teaching Council and not a teachers' Council. On none of the occasions when this view was advanced did I notice any objection or challenge from the hon. Gentleman. Where does he derive any authority in the Bill for his claim that this is a professional council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), in attempting to pursue the principle which he has adopted throughout his consideration of the various parts of the Bill, has had a little excess of zeal on the Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
ment, because I do not think he fully realises what its implications would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley was categorically against the establishment of a Council composed exclusively of teachers, as the Committee said in paragraph 64:
	<br><q><p>"Indeed, it is worth noting in passing that none of the bodies or persons who submitted written evidence to us advocated the creation of a Council so constituted."</p></q>
The Wheatley Committee pointed out how necessary it was that various public interests should be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendment would be that not only local authority representatives would be required to be registered teachers. It would mean that the persons appointed from the universities of Scotland would have to be registered teachers. Holders of chairs at universities may well not be registered teachers in the meaning of registration under the Bill. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman will realise that he is taking his principle just a little too far in attempting to convince the Committee that the Amendment should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite unrepentant on this, despite what Lord Wheatley says in paragraph 64. I am completely unable to understand why the teaching profession should be treated in a different way from any other trade or profession. We have any number of professional bodies set up to administer professions. I have already mentioned the lawyers and the doctors. I have even mentioned the hairdressers. There are various professions supplementary to medicine which are completely self-governing. Only this morning I received through the post a Bill presented to Parliament yesterday by a number of hon. Members representative of all parties. I refer to the Plumbers Registration Bill, the first object of which is the establishment of a plumbers registration council. If plumbers can be given a professional or trade body, self-governing, representative of themselves, it is impossible for me to understand why teachers should be treated in any lesser way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This point has been made before. Surely the hon. Gentleman appreciates that there is a difference between the professions he has mentioned and solicitors or plumbers? They are in business for themselves, or apparently waiting to be approached to be hired. This is a public service. Is not this the simple answer to the point the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
Gentleman has tried to make all along? Teachers serve the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) is being particularly insulting to plumbers. It seems evident to me that plumbers also perform a very essential public service. Many plumbers are employed by local authorities and by the central Government. Under the Plumbers Registration Bill the plumbers registration council would consist of, among others, four persons who would be employers of persons and it goes on to say that four persons would be employees engaged in the trade. If the plumbers, who are a very respectable trade, are capable of governing their own affairs, why should not the teachers in Scotland? This Bill, cribbed and confined as it is, and introducing all sorts of outside bodies into the Council, is grossly insulting to teachers. I am afraid that I am completely unrepentant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With Amendment No. 37 I think that we should discuss the Amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) Nos. 50 and 51: in page 11, leave out lines 12 to 14; in page 11, line 14, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>(iii)one by the Education Committee of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(iv) one by the Scottish Hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(v) one by the Primus of the Episcopal Church in Scotland.</p></q>
</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 11, line 19, at the end to insert:
	<br><q><p>(vi) one by the Education Committee of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>one by the Scottish Hierachy of the Roman Catholic Church.</p></q>
</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am thoroughly in agreement with the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary on this occasion that the Education Committee of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and the Scottish hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church should be represented directly on the Council. Many people in the Committee and elsewhere think that religious instruction is of paramount importance, and is far more important, especially for young children, than any other subject taught in schools. These
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
two bodies have traditionally taken a very great interest in education, and I believe it is right and proper that they should be represented. I always remember the teaching of St. Ignatius de Loyola, who said, "Give me a boy till he is 7. You can have him after that".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Lady that she has not gone quite far enough. Special provision should be made for the representation of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which is different from any other denomination in that, with the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church, it is traditionally associated with education in Scotland. It has been customary in the past for the Episcopal Church to maintain its own schools. In many instances, especially in the north of Scotland, but throughout the south of Scotland as well, the Scottish Episcopal Church set up its own schools from its own resources to teach in a religious sense its own point of view. This has been commended throughout the years. One Education Act after another has made provision for the continuation of these schools in which the Episcopal Church in Scotland has an interest. Many of these schools are still in existence and are doing extremely good work as part of Scotland's general education system. The Episcopal Church in Scotland is in a peculiar position, and the Committee should recognise this fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not alone in expressing this point of view, because I have here a letter from Bishop Ward who represents the Archdiocese of Glasgow, and, I believe, the Scottish hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. He says this:
	<br><q><p>"Regarding your difficulty in drawing the line, I feel that the claims of the Church of Scotland, the Episcopalian Church in Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church should always receive consideration. They have tradition behind them and have done great work in the educational field in our country in the past, and I feel that the traditional pattern should be used as an argument against claims by other religious denominations."</p></q>
It would be appropriate if I were to finish on that note and say that the plea I make for the Episcopal Church of Scotland has the backing of one of the principal denominations in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to ask the hon. Member how many schools are maintaned by the Episcopal Church in Scotland? It would be helpful to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the worth of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). In constituting the Council in accordance with the recommendations of the Report of the Wheatley Committee account has been taken of the existing constitution of the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers, particularly in relation to Church representation. It had originally been thought that the representation from the Churches need not be explicitly provided for in the Bill, although my right hon. Friend now believes it is best to do so. The Episcopal Church of Scotland and the other reformed Churches have not been represented on the central organisation concerned with teacher training. It is thought that to introduce into the new Council a principle which was not accepted in relation to the old body would be inappropriate. I recognise the legitimate concern of the Episcopal Church and, indeed, of the other Church of Scotland. If one were to provide for the Episcopal Church, it would be very difficult to resist an argument for providing for other churches. It seems appropriate to provide for explicit representation of the Church of Scotland and of the Roman Catholic Church but not for others. For this reason, I must ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the hon. Lady genuinely and sincerely, without any strings attached, for having accepted what, I think, was the feeling on both sides of the House of Commons and of the whole of this Committee in giving two seats as of right to the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church. I can accept also without reservation her worry about adding the Episcopal Church to the Bill in this place because, though it has probably had a longer traditional connection with education in Scotland, it was not on the former Council, and to bring it in at this stage would inevitably raise questions from the other Churches, which would be hard to resist if one selected one but not the others. I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Lady and I think that the Committee would come to the right decision in accepting the position as she suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 40 in the name of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), and it will, I think, be convenient to discuss with it his following five Amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 11, line 24, to leave out the first "4" and to insert "3".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments to be made on these Amendments are both general and particular. We have now reached the point of clarity in the realisation that we have not and never have been discussing a teachers' council but a professional council. It has become necessary to emphasise this partly because of what I regard as not an incorrect but as a misleading inference from the feeling that there is to be a majority of teachers on the Council.

To have such a majority was the intention of the Wheatley Committee, which said that it wanted the profession to exercise a major influence on the work of the Council; but the present set-up, as arrived at and recommended by the Wheatley Committee, does not achieve this aim. It does not allow the profession to exert a major influence on the Council. It is true that the profession is the major single influence when compared with the others but, nevertheless, it has only 25 of the 44 seats on the Council and this does not give the correct inference as to the nature of teaching representation that the Wheatley Committee desired. Indeed, out of the 25, only 10 are practising teachers in any sense—one from the colleges of education, one from further education, only four from secondary

education and only four from primary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my Amendments is to increase the proportion of practising teachers to 15. It is not to alter the overall figure of 25. I do not ask or demand the alteration of the balance within the Council. I would, indeed, have preferred that, but I am not seeking it today. I only seek a modest change, and a strengthening of the representation of practising teachers within the teacher's group as opposed to those concerned with administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are five representatives of the colleges of education and four of them are principals. It could be argued that principals are more in touch with educational matters than the others, but I disagree. They are more in touch but not to the extent of being allocated four out of the five places in this group of representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, indeed, an extremely important body which might not get representation at all—the heads of various departments. It is important that they should be represented because they, of all teachers, are closest perhaps to the kind of problems involved. It is they who deal with the students arriving on the basis of existing standards of entry, etcetera, to a much greater extent even than principals who, like all administrators, are so much concerned with the day-to-day problems of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the modest suggestion that we should have only three principals out of the group instead of four. I am not asking for anything dramatic. I would have preferred a much bigger change but I am not seeking to get its acceptance by the Secretary of State. I do, however, ask for this change in the interests of the Bill, of the Wheatley Committee, and of the Teaching Council. It may have been that the inclusion of four principals was arrived at with the idea of this number including a Roman Catholic representative, but that aspect has now been taken care of by the Amendment we have just agreed to. These representatives will technically be elected by the group they represent, but in effect they will be elected by nine people and will not be fully representative. I ask my hon. Friend to look at this again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
My next Amendments are concerned with primary and secondary education. I am accepting the position as it is for further education. Grossly under-represented as it is, I am prepared to leave the position. Here, however, the problem is that of the tendency of headquarters not to be so closely in touch with temporary teaching problems as we feel it always should be. The ideal headmaster should certainly be in touch, but the average headmaster is so involved in problems of staffing, timetables, and the care of, perhaps, up to 1,000 children in inadequate buildings, that he cannot be in as close touch with education thinking as he should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By altering the proportions in this group and increasing the representation of teachers as compared with the representation of headmasters—this would increase the number of teachers from four to six—we should ensure representatives who were closer to the problems, who have more recently entered the profession and who know the problems which students are facing. They would be able to make a bigger contribution to the work of the Council. They are closer both to educational theory and student problems. My proposals would also bring in the key people in education—the heads of departments. They are not too far away from the practical problems concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This argument—that of getting a larger number of teachers closer to the practical problems—also applies to the primary schools. Here, there is a very important particular argument to which I would like the Secretary of State to pay a great deal of attention. This is the habit in Scottish schools of appointing male headmasters although the overwhelming proportion of teachers in primary schools are women. It is extremely difficult, in practice, for a woman to become a headmistress. There is an inordinate proportion of male headmasters in primary schools compared with the number of women teachers. If we are to retain the Bill's figure of five teachers on the Council representing the primary school interest, then we shall give male teachers in this group inordinate representation. We are thus in grave danger of giving women teachers great under-representation although their recruitment is a key factor. Indeed, my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
Under-Secretary of State has launched a campaign to bring back women into teaching. Yet there is a grave danger of women teachers being under-represented or, indeed, not represented at all, if we leave this Schedule as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the general case I want above all to emphasise the particular case of the colleges and the primary schools. The Wheatley Report said:
	<br><q><p>"We think it important that a considerable number of the members drawn from the profession should be eminent teachers of standing, and we have, therefore, made specific provision for election of head teachers, who are likely from the nature of their wide experience to be especially useful in the deliberations of the Council."</p></q>
I feel that the Wheatley Committee did not give sufficient attention to all the problems that I have referred to. Nor did it make a case for such an inordinate percentage in all departments given to representation by principals or head teachers. I ask my hon. Friend to reconsider this very carefully. I am not asking for revolutionary change, but a sensible, modest, practical and very necessary change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) has raised various points of first-class importance. It has been long the experience, at least of most of us on this side of the Committee, that throughout industry and in many professions there has always been a demand, in our movement, for what we call workers' control. That has been a legitimate expression of a desire, on behalf of many able people who have later on distinguished themselves in other spheres of life, that they should be a little more than merely workers—the people who are always doing the jobs and sometimes not the best of jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that all of us here can think of men who are now in such jobs and who are doing magnificent work on local authorities and in wider spheres. The ability is there and one cannot deny the ability, which has shown itself on the industrial side, to the pedagogical side. In the teaching profession, many people distinguish themselves and show their abilities not merely in the profession but outside it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will give careful thought to the Amendment, because,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
when one looks at the position of the Teaching Council, one sees that the "bosses" are in control. I am not saying that in any offensive sense, but, nevertheless, we are to have represented on the Council the Association of County Councils—"bosses" of the teachers; the Scottish Counties of Cities Associations—again, the "bosses"; the Association of Directors of Education—"bosses" again. These are people at whose door one knocks and stays out. As one of them used to say, some people could knock at his door and walk in; others knocked and stayed out. Another group to be represented is the governing bodies of the central institutions—all gentlemen and, I presume, ladies of an eminence which has been earned, but they are those that the individual in the classroom approaches only on request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the elected representatives we find that the head teachers or principals, both in secondary and primary schools, are in command. They are the bosses again. That is an emphasis which we ought to try to alter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The method suggested by my hon. Friend is one way of doing so. It has often been said that it is difficult to relieve a class teacher from his or her teaching duties; but that it is not so difficult to relieve a head teacher. He just indicates his potential absence, locks his door and goes away. The class teacher cannot do that; there must be a substitute for him. He is tied to his desk. In view of the present shortage of teachers it may be said that it will be difficult to relieve many class teachers very often. I hope that that argument will not be used, because in a well-regulated profession there should be a sufficient supply of substitutes, and if there is not, that is not the fault of the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the positive side, we are giving the class teacher the chance of obtaining a wider insight into the interesting work involved in helping to carry on an outside body which will have an important part to play in the lives of teachers. I hope that my hon. Friend will remember that. There is little chance for a class teacher or a subject teacher to obtain this type of experience in his ordinary life. Every time the opportunity comes his way he has to get time off, even for passing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
engagements. This provision offers him a chance to take up a permanent place on the administrative side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will at least promise to think the matter over. I am not urging her to come to a decision today, but I hope that she will agree to think about the matter in order to see whether it is possible to give the class teacher a little better standing, and a better opportunity to take part in this type of work than has been possible in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first time in our proceedings I find myself in some uncertainty as to what is the best thing to do. I have been re-reading one or two paragraphs in the Wheatley Report, and I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) will look at them. The Wheatley Committee says:
	<br><q><p>"It is essential to our conception of the Council that its members should be thought of, and should think of themselves as, persons who hold office because their qualities and experience enable them to make a significant contribution to the Council's business. They should exercise an independent judgment on the problems with which they are confronted, and their primary concern should always be to do what they themselves think is best in all matters within the ambit of the Council's functions. They should not be regarded … as delegates …"</p></q>
for example. I think that my hon. Friend may have stressed this side of the question too much. I hope that we are not misunderstanding the purposes of the Council. It is not a negotiating body between the staff and the employers. It is set up for a specific purpose. If one looks through the summary one finds that there will be 28 certificated teachers on the Council, which is three more than my hon. Friend has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend is making. He feels that there should be representation on the Council for people who are, so to speak, at the grass roots—those in the classrooms who are experiencing the day-to-day troubles of recalcitrant pupils and parents, the difficulties of introducing new examinations, and so on. I come down in favour of asking my hon. Friend to consider the matter further. At the moment my view would be to resist the Amendment, but, in the light of the case that has been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
made, and because I can see two or three other little difficulties, I hope that my hon. Friend will reconsider the matter and give us her thoughts about it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the present composition of the Council. Listening to my hon. Friends this morning I began to wonder whether they shared the general conception of the purpose of the Council. They seemed to think that local education authorities would be superseded and that there would be no need for them to operate in their normal spheres. It is no good my hon. Friend shaking his head. I am exaggerating the matter to show how far my hon. Friends are departing from the purpose for which we are setting up the Council. Its purpose is to maintain the quality of teachers and to deal with the question of registration, the withdrawal of registration, and the supply of teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend show me in what way the supplanting of a principal by a class teacher will subvert the functions of the Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. That is why I started in the way I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that we know more or less precisely the broad duties which will fall upon the members of the Council. We also know that one or two related matters may be considered by it, and that it may then make representations to the Secretary of State. We also know that it will have nothing whatever to do with making recommendations about salaries or conditions of service. The argument which has been adduced would have been more appropriate to a body which was to deal with the question of curricula within schools. If it could be shown that one of the main purposes of the Council is to consider the whole setup of teaching in the schools there would be some validity in the argument which has been adduced, but in the confines of the activities of the Council, as I see them, not a single argument has been adduced which can be seriously maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can anyone here envisage my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) becoming a headmaster and then departing so far from a consideration of the interests of teachers that he would never defend them, but would forget all about them? My hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
Friend shakes his head. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has been a head teacher, and a teacher of long standing. If he were on a Council of this kind would he totally forget all his long years and experience in the classroom, and so desert those who were following in his footsteps that he would act in a way inimical to their best interests? Nobody would entertain such an idea. Yet we have been told that the head teacher is an animal who is entirely different from a class teacher, and who has been so completely transformed that his sole concern is to down the class teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must protest. This is a grotesque misrepresentation of what I said. It did not even arise. However, I will deal with the matter later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be putting a wide interpretation on what my hon. Friend said, but his arguments lend themselves to that interpretation. If he says that we should supplant one head teacher by a class teacher, I ask him for what purpose. Is it because he is younger? Is it because he has more experience than a head teacher? A head teacher has had class teacher experience, and he has some knowledge of administration. He knows the difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that my hon. Friend is putting the case that my arguments lead to his conclusions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument has been put forward that the head teacher has forgotten all the experience which he gained in the class room, although he probably spent 20 or 25 years there. It is said that we must have on the Council someone who is fresh from the classroom—someone who has been there for only two or three years and who will keep reminding the head teacher representatives what is going on in the classrooms. It is suggested that the head teacher representatives will have long since forgotten what happened in the classrooms. I am sure that my hon. Friends would not like that interpretation to be placed upon their arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the matter a stage further. Who will elect the registered teachers who will form the majority of the Council? The teachers themselves. If we were to have people nominated by the Secre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
tary of State I could see some force in the argument that the interests of the class teachers might be completely overlooked but, as my hon. Friend has said, how can it be argued that the position of certain people will be overlooked when the vast number of people on the electoral roll will be those people themselves? This is the weapon which they will use to ensure that their interests are represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned women head teachers. Does he know how many headmistresses we have in Glasgow schools? We have any number of them. Certain categories of school are more or less confined to women. I would not like to say what percentage of women were headmistresses of Glasgow primary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safety valve is the fact that the teachers will elect their representatives to the Council. If they make a mistake they can remedy it at a future date. Provision is also made that if the system of allocation of membership proves to be unsatisfactory after a period of trial the basis of election can be altered. What would be the advantage of making the change in that number of head teachers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the Educational Institute of Scotland, representing 36,000 teachers, I do not think that the change proposed is necessary. It is a rare occurrence indeed—I cannot recall one such occurrence—when an assistant teacher has been appointed President of the Institute. Consider for a moment the duties of a person appointed President of that Institute. Must he look after only the interests of head teachers and employers, as was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin)? No. He must represent the interests of the entire membership of the Institute, which is by no means exclusively male.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be interested if my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West would tell me of any instance he knows where a head teacher or a person of similar authority has not represented the majority of teachers and the interests of teachers generally. I believe that they have represented them extremely well. Can he tell me of any organisation which represents only headmasters' associations or secondary school teachers? The President and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
Executive Council of the Institute look after the interests of all teachers—the interests of head teachers, the principals of colleges of education; all of them. It cannot be said that a teacher, having gone through his career, having been promoted, having served his profession faithfully, having been promoted for his outstanding eminence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that 12 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room, and 12 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall that in my early days as a propagandist my difficulty was to get a gathering of people to start a meeting. This must be the first time that my speech has resulted in the whole audience dissolving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asking whether the E.I.S. was badly served by its President and members of its Executive Council. I am suggesting that head teachers, with their experience, and administrators, with equal experience, could be extremely useful. I urge the Committee to consider what would happen if a young teacher went to a meeting of the Teaching Council and found that his director of education was sitting round the table with him as, say, one of the nominees of the Association of Directors of Education. It would be a courageous young teacher indeed who would be prepared to advance revolutionary proposals in the presence of his director of education, knowing that, to a large extent, his future promotion might depend on his director's attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for my hon. Friend to say that, but his experience is limited to the classroom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely my hon. Friend is not making that an accusation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making it an accusation. I am saying that it is essential that there should be a combination of classroom and managerial experience. I am not talking about "boss" experience but the experience of head teachers and administrators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
The suggestion is that the number should be reduced by one to enable an assistant teacher to step in. I am discussing where the advantage lies between an assistant teacher whose experience is solely that of the classroom, and a head teacher, who has experience as a classroom teacher and as an administrator in running a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen cases where an individual would be in a difficult position in wishing to express views when his director of education has been present, for such an individual must—and hon Members will appreciate this—be afraid that if he expresses revolutionary views that might affect his future. I am not saying that such a thing would happen; just that it might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Till we can have a reasonable indication of what the reasons are for making the proposed change of representation on the Teaching Council I cannot support the arguments which were adduced in favour of the Amendments and for altering the ratio of promoted people compared with non-promoted people. I suggest that we leave well alone. If it is found necessary to make an alteration later—if it is found that the whole setup of representation has been wrong—the teachers themselves will be able to make any necessary changes by the weapon which they have; namely, the vote. They will be able to make those changes when elections take place to the Teaching Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The feeling I have had from attending the meetings of the Committee and from reading the Report of the last Sitting—which, I regret, I could not attend—is that the Committee tends to be rather harsh on suggestions put forward by the hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan). I suggest that in this case such treatment of the hon. Member's proposal is unjustified because, in the arguments he adduced, he had a good case, and I suggest that the Committee considers them seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speeches of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) in their own way did not deal adequately with the points raised by the hon. Member for Renfrew, West. To begin with, the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
for Glasgow, Shettleston rightly pointed out that head teachers or people in authority could adequately and fairly—and perhaps even better than others—represent the interests of the teachers. On the other hand, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan said, equally correctly, that a teacher is in the unique position of being able to see the problems of the classroom and that, to that extent, such a person should represent the teachers. The hon. Member for Renfrew, West, on the other hand, said not that one was wrong or that the other was wrong but he was referring to the question of balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member will, in fairness, agree that he is somewhat misinterpreting my argument. He is particularising, whereas I was dealing with a body of persons—a very responsible body of well-educated and highly experienced persons—in a more general way, and I stated that in my view those people, who are in the public life of teaching, should be more greatly represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I have taken the hon. Gentleman's speech wrongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is fair to say, as the hon. Gentleman has now said, that there is, perhaps, a group of teachers who are representing—in teachers' organisations, councils and so on—teachers, but who may be themselves getting a little apart from the problems in the classroom. This sort of thing tends to happen. People who represent teachers on councils and various organisations and bodies tend to do so to such an extent—they spend such a great time discussing the problems involved—that they do not have sufficient time left to get practical experience of the problems of the classroom. I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan and his hon. Friends are aware of this possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the hon. Member for Renfrew, West was more concerned in his speech with the question of balance. He wanted to know what was the right balance between people in positions of authority and people from the classroom or people who had been promoted to a minor degree. In the Bill we have the proposal that there should be a minimum of 14 or 15 people in supervisory posi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
tions and 10 or 11 teachers from the classroom. The hon. Member for Renfrew, West suggests that those figures should be reversed and that they should be 15 and 10, the other way round. He made it clear that he did not necessarily think that his ideas would be accepted in full. He was suggesting, as I understood his remarks, that some move should be made along the lines he had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that if we are on the one hand suggesting that the figures should be 15 and 10 in one direction, and if the hon. Member for, Renfrew, West suggests that they should be 15 and 10 in the other direction, it might be possible to reach an amicable compromise between the two so that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) really must not read a newspaper in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Brewis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee will be noted for its interruptions rather than for its progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, there may be room for compromise here. As I see it, the hon. Member for Renfrew, West is suggesting that in sub-paragraphs (2,	<i>c</i>) and (2,	<i>d</i>) instead of "five" the provision should state "three' and he is also suggesting that the same principle should apply in sub-paragraph (2,	<i>a</i>). I feel that this may be going a little too far. If we have nine registered teachers from secondary schools and nine from the primary schools, that may be going too far. Perhaps we should aim at six and three, or the correct relationship might be five and four. If moves were made along those lines I would probably support them. I am sure that arguments would be put forward if it were suggested that we should have exclusively teachers who had direct experience of the classroom—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that head teachers have not had direct experience of the classroom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In using the word "direct" I meant recent experience. I was in no sense suggesting that headmasters have not got experience of the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
The arguments for having headmasters, teachers and others in position of experience representing the teachers are valid. The arguments adduced by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston in respect of a body comprised of persons who have been promoted to positions of authority—people who might, perhaps feel freer to put forward their points of view—is equally valid. I appreciate the point that someone older and more experienced—someone who has seen the problems over a period of years—can take a more objective view. The third argument, a fair one, is that someone with the advantage of age and experience can often take a wider view of the problems and can, perhaps, more adequately look at some of the solutions which have been tried in the past and at some of the problems which have arisen as a result of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, generally speaking, if the hon. Member for Renfrew, West would be prepared to adjust his Amendments in relation to sub-paragraphs (2,	<i>c</i>) and (2,	<i>d</i>) and change the sugestion from three to four, I would be pleased to support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and important discussion. I will try, first, to re-establish what I understand we are discussing and to be the purpose of the Amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan). I take it that his concern is not in any way to strengthen the teachers' representatives in any negotiating sense—because we are speaking about a body which, after all, is not a negotiating one—but with the way in which the Teaching Council may, in the words of the Wheatley Committee,

Friend emphasised that he was not seeking to alter the balance of the Council, and indeed this is true both in terms of total membership and in terms of the membership from each group. What he is concerned to do is to alter the balance between each group. The main tenor of his arguments in relation to all three sets of Amendments was that the person who was more recently
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
trained, more actively in touch with the actual job under consideration, was more likely to be a source of ideas than was the person who had to some extent become involved in administration. One important point which needs to be considered here is this. Suppose the General Teaching Council were considering the methods of training teachers in a particular subject. My hon. Friend's argument would be that if the Council included more people with direct experience in that particular field, the Council would be more likely to come to the correct view. On the other hand, anybody other than a headmaster or a principal of a college or a head teacher is unlikely to have a general view and is likely to be a specialist only in his or her particular field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to recognise that where the Teaching Council is considering matters involving ideas and initiatives, it will probably proceed to use specialist committees which it appoints. If it were seeking to carry out a study of methods of training in the teaching of English, for example, then clearly it would rely heavily on people within the profession in colleges and universities who had a great deal of expertise at their disposal. It would be concerned not so much with its own membership but with the membership of the committees it would appoint. To that extent my hon. Friend's argument loses some of its validity. It is no longer necessary to assume that the Council would be the main body considering a matter in which it was important to be up to date and in touch. My hon. Friend spoke of assistant teachers and said they were closer to educational theory, and this is, I think, the answer to that point which he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strong arguments which my hon. Friend put forward concerned primary head teachers. He said that unless his Amendment was accepted in relation to head teachers in primary schools there would tend to be an over-large representation of men and too small a representation of women on the Council. In fact, in October, 1963, within a total of 2,039 head teachers of primary schools no fewer than 917 were women—just under half. My hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) made the point that there would be a large number of teachers in the profession carrying out

the election of the teachers' representatives. Among primary teachers there are almost 15,700 women teachers out of a total of 18,400.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If we are considering this in terms of the relation of men to women, I am doubtful whether this particular point is of any substantial importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noted what the view of the Committee has seemed to be. The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) was in general support of the Amendment, though he doubted whether the balance expressed in the Amendments would be correct. My hon. Friend the Member for Govan was also in support, but my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston was opposed to the Amendment. My hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
arguments which have been adduced on the general question arising in this discussion. I think, perhaps, this may satisfy my hon. Friend that I understand the essence of the point he is making here, and that I have some sympathy with it. But it would be a case of balancing the purposes which he hopes to achieve by his Amendment with the need to follow the recommendations of Wheatley, disturbing the balance suggested by Wheatley as little as possible. Perhaps in these circumstances he may think it suitable to withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to thank my hon. Friend for understanding my argument. I do not think the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I reiterate this point about women. It seems to me that the figures adduced by my hon. Friend make the position worse than I thought it was, not better. Of 2,039 schools, 917, or less than half, have head teachers who are women, yet women provide about 80 per cent. of the teaching staff. I think these figures make the position regarding the under-representation of women worse. Some of the 917 schools are one-teacher schools. I do want my hon. Friend to look especially at the point in sub-paragraph (2,	<i>d</i>) again. The other point she did not deal with was the colleges. I want her also to look very closely at that point. I think, again, there is an undue proportion of principals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the argument has nothing to do with negotiation. I am solely concerned with the fact that this Council can be of great importance in developing educational thinking in Scotland. The point in sub-paragraph (2,	<i>d</i>) is of great importance, and I would also like to see (2,	<i>b</i> and 	<i>c</i>) changed.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
This is rather a long Amendment, and it may be that in some ways it has been drafted incorrectly, but I hope that this will not be used as an argument for rejecting it. when, perhaps, there is no other reason for doing so. The words "deep-rooted conscientious or religious reasons" were taken from a draft we approved when I was a member of the Corporation of Glasgow. We approved a resolution making trade union membership compulsory for employees of the City of Glasgow, but it was thought right that provision should be made for those who had deep-rooted conscientious or religious objections to joining a trade union. It is for these reasons that I am putting this proposal forward in relation to the Teaching Council Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know in what connection the hon. Member is quoting from the minutes of decisions of the City of Glasgow. When he said there was this opportunity to renounce trade union membership, I take it that at the time there was a corollary to that in that those employees would not directly benefit from trade union negotiations which increased status and emoluments, or improved conditions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had no division along these lines at all. It was the case that people who were members of the Corporation services did receive these things and there was no question of excluding them from any benefits. We did have a committee which looked at every case on its merits, and if we were convinced that there were deep-rooted conscientious or religious grounds we made provision for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been surprised at the heat this Amendment has engendered. When the Amendment was put forward it was signed by five persons. I noticed that two have since apparently withdrawn their names. I hope there have not been any pressures, but if there have been pressures of any sort I am mystified as to their origin. If there were, I am most grateful to those who have left their names to the Amendment. There was a remarkable accusation made earlier in discussions in this Committee that this Amendment was designed to be some kind of stunt which would attract political support. It may be fair to say
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
that some Amendments to this Bill obviously stem from groups and organisations outwith the Committee, but it is impossible to say this of a minority group which does not vote in Teaching Council elections or in any elections whatsoever, and which is an unpopular sect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this Amendment is to make statutory provision for considering objections on the grounds of conscience or religious persuasion from a small minority group popularly known as the Exclusive or Close Brethren. Individuals outside the sect may be covered by this Amendment, but it is largely with the interests of this group in mind that I put forward this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of teachers involved is impossible to say, but to the best of my knowledge it is round about 50. Forty teachers or students in teaching colleges did in fact make representations to the Wheatley Committee. The Report says this on page 65:
	<br><q><p>"In addition over 40 representations were received from teachers and students who asked that provision should be made in any scheme of registration for those who on grounds of conscience did not want to register or wished to renouice voting rights."</p></q>
From my own inquiries I understand that the number of teachers involved is approximately 50, but I feel that there will be a far greater number of people involved, because in fact a substantial number of persons belonging to this sect are at university at present. There is a considerable educational tradition within the movement, and a large number of its young people go to university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of professions which people in this sect can enter is severely limited because of the nature of their religious beliefs. I understand that there has been a considerable increase in the number of people within the sect who have shown interest in becoming members of the teaching profession. So, if we did not make provision which made it possible for members of the sect to become members of the teaching profession, there would be, not only the danger of losing approximately 50 teachers, but also the greater danger of stopping a substantial inflow of people into teacher training colleges from the universities. In considering this, account must be taken not only of a bare figure of between 40 and 50, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
also of what might be the accelerated intake because of the limited number of professions which members of the sect can enter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady should consider four questions. The first is the practical question whether we can afford to lose between 40 and 50 teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's argument. I have not been paying the close attention to this sect which the hon. Gentleman obviously has. Even if voting papers are sent out to approximately 50 teachers, is there any way of forcing anybody to return the voting paper if he does not want to? The simple way out would be for these people not to return the voting paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to deal with that point later, but, as the hon. Gentleman has raised it, I will deal with it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to justify or explain this, but it appears that members of the sect are of the opinion that, unless they can formally renounce their voting rights—in other words, unless they can quite openly and formally renounce them—they will not be prepared to accept the position. It is obvious that you or I, Mr. Brewis, if we do not want to vote in any election, do not go to the polling station and cast our vote. This is the sensible and rational point of view. However, having spoken to a considerable number of these people and having been in correspondence with them, I know that they are firmly of the opinion that, unless they can formally renounce their voting rights, this situation would be intolerable from their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is recognised by other organisations. The dental profession makes a similar provision that people are able to renounce their voting rights. Therefore, the first question the Under-Secretary should consider is: can we afford to lose between 40 and 50 teachers and the prospect of many more to come?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question whether we should make statutory provision for such a body? Lord Wheatley expressed his own opinions at page 57 of the Wheatley Report. He says in para-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
graph 183 that a substantial number of representations were received but that
	<br><q><p>"For the reasons already given we think that registration must be compulsory; the renunciation of voting rights, however, is another matter, but one which we feel is more for the Teaching Council than for us."</p></q>
Some people may argue that if we put a provision of this nature into the Bill we shall be doing a job which should be left to the Council. People may ask: could not the Council appropriately make provision for people of certain views within the profession? In some circumstances, this might well be an appropriate way to deal with it, but I, for one, am not prepared to pass a Bill, and am not in fact prepared to agree to a Bill, which might have the effect of depriving people of their livelihood, as the matter could be adjusted simply by an Amendment of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People might well say that this matter would be dealt with fairly and rationally by teachers. I am sure that of all the professions teachers would tend to be the most reasonable and responsible in this way, but we have to consider all the possibilities which might emerge from the Bill. I believe that we should make statutory provision for this body, and I would be much happier if we did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other people may argue that this would be the thin end of the wedge of what might be called syndicalist legislation. In other words, they will ask, have we to make provision in every Bill on all types of affairs for every single objection of every single body? For example, if we are to pass the Plumbers Registration Bill, must we make provision for particular groups of interests throughout the country and make provision for perhaps different ways of operating their businesses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only time we should make a provision is where there is a possibility of somebody being deprived of his livelihood or life, or of his right to worship freely, because of deep-rooted conscientious or religious reasons. It is not fair to argue that, if this Amendment is passed, we shall have to make provision in every Bill for every type of pressure group or interest. This is a special case in my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect the Under-Secretary should consider is not only whether we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
should approve of this but what precisely would be lost if we approved the Amendment? Would this in any way affect the powers and responsibilities of the Council? Would it undermine in any way the principle which we are trying to establish by approving the Bill? In other words, would there be any adverse effects? The only effect I can think of is that, if such a provision were approved we should be committed to making similar provision in other Bills when establishing similar councils. It is only fair for me to say that I consider that such provision should be made. But apart from that, I do not think that anything would be lost by putting this forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a final question which the Under-Secretary will have to consider. If we make this special provision in the Bill for this sect and its interests and its beliefs is this in any way giving our approval as a Committee or as a House of Commons to the point of view put forward by the sect, the views it expresses and the beliefs it holds? I do not think that there can be any question here. Neither I nor any Member of the Committee, I am sure, is a member of the sect. Many of us disapprove certain of its beliefs. We certainly do not share them. We may also disapprove of certain of its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many centuries this has been a tolerant society. Our country has been a haven of refuge for groups of people who were persecuted abroad and deprived of their livelihood or their right to worship or work in freedom. This has been a great tradition of this country, and many bands of refugees have come to this country looking for refuge, looking for help, and looking for protection. Because of this, our laws, and the customs of our nation, over the years have been constructed in such a way as to permit full freedom of the exercise of religion and of political beliefs and of the social practices associated with such beliefs. This tolerance, this protection, was given only if it was consistent with public order. We made specific provision for all people who held beliefs of this sort and who wanted to exercise them in freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We as a nation have carried this to extreme limits—for instance, in the provison we made in wartime for conscientious objection by people being called
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
up on National Service and required to serve in the Armed Services. It was a tribute to our way of life that during the war, when we were battling for existence, and when many were giving up their lives, we made provision for those who had a conscientious objection to fighting or taking any part in armed conflict. This toleration and this provision constitutes one of the best features of our society and it is one which I want to preserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and many others have notice within the past few years that there has been a change in our attitude to tolerance. There has been a less flexible attitude to tolerance of different groups, societies and organisations which put forward strange beliefs and support strange practices. We were traditionally a most tolerant society, but there has in fact been a slight change in the past few years. We have in fact had cases of people who have been deprived of their livelihood and their right to work and deprived of normal social intercourse because of their beliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already been asked, what is the point of bothering here. People will argue; no one is forced to vote; no one has to exercise this right to vote. I cannot possibly argue this on logical or rational grounds. I cannot explain beliefs which I myself do not hold. I believe that it is only right that we should make provision for people who hold these beliefs to such an extent that they are prepared to be deprived of their livelihood, and are prepared to be deprived even of their right to be employed in any place, because of the beliefs they sincerely hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We as a nation have a great regard for tolerance. We have made provision for it in the past. I hope that we shall do so again. To those with tidy minds who want to introduce uniformity into every aspect of our life this may seem a strange and unusual thing to do. I plead with the Committee to look at this on its merits and to consider what would be the advantage of it and what would be the possible loss involved in approving an Amendment along these lines. For these reasons, I hope that the Committee will support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) but I have always been impressed by his logic. Today this has ended. There was no logic whatever in his argument. If he studies the constitution of this sect a little more closely he will find that one of the things the members of the sect constantly say is that they respect government and obey laws. They constantly repeat this. I have had dozens of letters from members of the sect. They constantly stress this fact. If we pass a law providing that they must receive a ballot paper, I can tell the hon. Gentleman in advance that by their own constitution they will accept this. They have said it over and over again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the most fantastic argument I have ever heard. Surely in a democracy we should encourage everyone to use his vote—most of all, teachers. If people do not want to receive ballot papers—we are asked to go out of our way to ensure they do not receive them—they should not take this matter up merely on the question of ballot papers for electing members of the Teaching Council. They should go back to first principles and start in relation to ballot papers for Parliamentary and local elections. These people are perfectly willing to accept those ballot papers, because they accept the laws of the country and are prepared to obey them. They make no effort not to receive ballot papers for Parliamentary elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When did the hon. Gentleman last receive through the post a ballot paper for a Parliamentary or local election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people receive papers for voting by post. I have no doubt that these people receive many papers of this kind at different times. If they do not want to receive them, they can always tell the Post Office that they do not want to receive them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that these people, who, apparently, want to cut themselves off in this way, have no hesitation whatever about writing to those who have been elected without their votes when they want to get something done. These people are amongst my most frequent correspondents. It was news to me until this debate started that they never voted. If I had known that, I might have been tempted to give them different answers from some of those I have given them.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
Not because they voted for me but for a different reason altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that we might lose 40 or 50 teachers because of this is nonsense. Even if we did, because they have prejudices as strong as that—which is doubtful—a great many people might think that a good thing for teaching. But I doubt very much whether we shall lose them because of an insistence that they obey the law and accept the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to cater to minority groups to this extent it will be a very costly business. As a member of a local authority my attention was once drawn to the fact that a corporation department was sending out accounts from the water department for a nil amount of money. I queried why, and it was proved conclusively to me by the department that it was cheaper to send out accounts to everyone, including those who owed nothing, than to pick out those cases and exclude them from accounts. It would be a costly business to have to go (through the register, when sending correspondence to all teachers, and select those who were not to receive it. If we were to start on that process it could be subsequently extended to all sorts of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the last person to stop religious freedom. Indeed, I have objected on Fridays in the House to a Bill which would prevent these people from practising their religious beliefs. Everyone has a right to practise his religious beliefs, but the hon. Member for Cathcart is stretching this a bit far. Indeed, he is taking it to the point of being ridiculous when it is argued that a group of persons who are presumably fit to be teachers would give up their jobs if they were sent through the post a ballot paper which they did not have to return. If they are to take that attitude it is doubtful whether they are fit to be teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Teaching Council would examine that position if that were so, but I do not believe that it is. Various letters that I have had from members of this sect suggest that it is not the case, and I suggest that the hon. Member talks to some of his constituents who are members of this body and gets a copy of their constitution or beliefs. I think he will find that he is wrong, and that he is wildly exaggerating this. The Committee should reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, it may well wish to be assured about the position of teachers with conscientious objections. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) made the point that there might be a danger of losing a number of teachers as a result of the provision. That argument would only have merit if the Amendment related not only to voting but to registration. Some teachers object to registration, but the Amendment does not refer to that matter, and it is not a question that one could legitimately expect statutory action to be taken upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley Committee looked at this point in paragraph 183 of the Report. On the question of renouncing voting rights it took the view that this was more a question for the Council than for the Wheatley Committee. That is the Government's position as well. Rather than write anything in by way of statutory provision, we believe that this matter is better left to the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the Bill with the effect of forcing a person to exercise voting rights if he does not want to. Here, the Bill follows the provisions in the Training Authorities' Regulations, 1958, under which elections are held every three years for teacher-governors of colleges of education. Teachers are not compelled to vote in elections. No special provision was included in the Regulations for the renouncing of rights.

Although I appreciate that the Committee does not agree with me, and that many people think this foolish, I feel so strongly about the matter that I must press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That those words be there inserted:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 2, Noes 17.</p>
	<p>is too long. As far as I have been able to discover very few, if any, advisory bodies or councils set up by Statute have so long a membership period. I think that the general rule is two years, with three years in exceptional cases. Of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
course, there is another elected body—the House of Commons; but I do not suppose that any of us expect to be here in the present Parliament in five years' time. On the other hand, the members of the Teaching Council are to be elected for a specific period Which is too long, in my submission. I have talked to a number of teachers in my constituency about this.</p>
	<p>It is conceivable that a man could be elected a year before retirement, which would mean that for three years he would be out of touch with current feeling in the profession. That case may be pushing it a little far, and I do not imagine that any such person would get elected, but it is a possibility.</p>
	<p>Secondly, we have in this country an establishment feeling and people tend to be re-elected to a body merely because they have served on it before. That does not, I am happy to say, always occur in the case of Members of Parliament, but it does occur in many other bodies, and is likely to do so on the Teaching Council. Again, four years is too long in that context.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, in bodies of this nature we want constant infusions of new blood, with younger men and women. If we reduce the period from four years to three we would get these infusions. It may be said that older people have more experience, and that may be so, but younger men and women who are teachers themselves are more inclined to get about to attend meetings and to keep their fingers, as it were, on the pulse.</p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>The Council may not be in operation for another 15 months. It means that anybody who may be aspiring to become a member and who is not elected in the first year of operation has to wait for 5¼ years from now. I admit that that is not a very strong argument for reducing the period, but I ask the hon. Lady to give us some idea of what the Secretary of State was getting at when, as it seemed to me, he extended the period of service from the normal term to one of four years.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Broadly speaking, it is because the norm to which the hon. Member has referred has been changing. A period of three years' service used to be regarded as the norm in the case of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
many bodies. This is not only no longer so; some of the most important of these bodies have gone to great trouble to ensure that a change was made to extend the period from three to four years largely on the ground of the need for some continuity of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody who has served on a committee of any organisation knows that in the first year after election the committee is settling down, and that in the last year before an election its members have their eyes on the election. Only in the intervening period does such a committee get down to work without the disturbance involved in recovering from or looking forward to the substantial change which is involved in an election. It is to give a bigger middle period of office that many organisations have decided upon a four-year period rather than a three-year period. In the National Health Service the members of Regional Hospital Boards and boards of management were originally appointed for a three-year period, but in 1959 the House of Commons thought fit to make a Statutory Instrument which increased the period from three to four years, for the reasons which I have put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member addressed much of his argument to the fact that he was afraid that there would be too many older people on the Council, and that a reduction from four years to three would be bound to reduce the age of members. He was really addressing himself to an Amendment which has not been put down—an Amendment to reduce further the age of the members of the Council. In fact there will be casual vacancies. There always are on bodies of this kind, particularly bodies as large as this one. These will bring about the appointment or the election of successors, so that in practice there will be a continual slight renewal of membership which will not take away all the continuity provided for by the period of four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said, and the examples which I have given, will show that we are not departing from the norm, and that the norm itself has been in the process of changing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that the norm appeared to be changing. From the contact which I have had with teachers in my constituency it does not

seem that they want a change in the norm to creep into the Council. Is the hon. Lady saying that in her opinion the teachers—who will form the bulk of the Council—wish this norm to be four as opposed to three years? Has she any grounds for saying that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am putting forward the argument that we should follow rather than reject the Wheatley recommendation, which was that the period should be four years.

The Amendment is in some ways similar to one which we discussed on Clause 10, which related to the Investigating and Disciplinary Committees. In order to justify the Amendment it is important to consider paragraph 16 of the Schedule, which relates to the committee on exceptional admission to the register. It will be observed in subparagraph (1) that
	<br><q><p>"The Council shall appoint a committee … and shall delegate to that committee the functions of the Council"</p></q>
which are concerned with reviewing the principles specified in any statement made under Clause 8, and also to take over the functions of the Council in dealing with applications for registration under Clause 6(2,	<i>c</i>). Sub-paragraph (2) provides that where a person is aggrieved by a decision of the committee he shall ask the Council to review the decision. The sub-paragraph goes on to say that in relation to any such review
	<br><q><p>"no person, other than the chairman of the Council, who was a member of the said committee at the time when its decision was taken</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
	<p>tendency to move towards a period of four years. We are simply justifying the Wheatley Committee's conclusions on the matter.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member wish to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think I do, Mr. Brewis, because if I did, I would be letting down those with whom I have had conversations, and who presumably have faith and trust in me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That "four" stand part of the Schedule:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>shall be entitled to take part in the proceedings of the Council."</p>
	<p>The Amendment would exclude the Chairman also. It seems unwise that he should serve both on the Council which is reviewing the decision of the committee and on the committee itself, where he had a casting vote.</p>
	<p>When we discussed a similar Amendment on Clause 10 the hon. Lady pointed out that she felt that, in relation to other professions, notably the medical profession, to allow the Chairman to serve on both the Investigating and Disciplinary Committees meant that there would be a certain element of continuity, even if the Chairman had a casting vote. She also pointed out that under Clause 10 the Investigating Committee was engaged only in a preliminary investigation; it was not a matter of very great substance.</p>
	<p>The case for excluding the Chairman is a good deal stronger here. The Council is delegating its powers to a committee to decide the principles on which it will or will not admit teachers with exceptional qualifications. The second question which is to be decided by the Council arises where a person feels aggrieved by a decision and wishes to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
have his case reviewed. In this case the position of the Chairman, with a casting vote, should be on a par with that of all the other members of the committee. In other words, he should be subject to the principle which is already enacted in the Bill, that no person shall serve on both bodies.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to make analogies with different professions, because no profession has a body which is completely analogous to the committee which is appointed to consider exceptional admissions. We put the whole matter into perspective by considering what has happened in relation to exceptional admissions and the refusal of applications for exceptional admission on the present basis, whereby the Committee on Exceptional Recognition of the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers makes a recommendation about certification to the Secretary of State. Since the Scottish Council was established in 1959 the Committee has recommended certification to the Secretary of State in over 1,200 cases, and in only 23 cases have there been appeals to the Secretary of State against the decisions of the Committee. Of these, only seven were successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are very involved matters, with which the present Committee at present has to deal and with which, under the Bill, the exceptional admission Committee would have to deal. They concern highly detailed and specialised matters, such as the content of various courses taken abroad which lead to certain qualifications abroad, and the comparability of the contents of those courses with courses taken in Scotland, and so on. They are very specialised matters, requiring great expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to provide some continuity by enabling the Chairman to be chairman of the appeal body as well. Because the membership of the Council is so widely based it would seem unlikely to adopt a narrow professional attitude. I do not think that there is any danger that the committee will tend to wish to exclude; it will be much more concerned to try to include, wherever it can find justification for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeal provision will preclude any member who is a member of the excep-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
tional admission committee, other than the Council Chairman, from hearing and deciding an appeal, and the individual will have the right of appearance before the Council at a hearing. Thus, there are safeguards. It is not that a decision made by the committee is a hard and fast one for all time. There are opportunities for it to be thought over again. There is the opportunity for appeal, and there is a real need, because of the nature of the subjects coming before the committee, that there should be some continuity; which can only be provided if we exclude all other members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think, therefore, that the argument here is entirely related to the Investigating and Disciplinary Committees which we considered in the body of the Bill, although all I said there is of relevance here. There is, in addition, because of the subject matter, this special need which justifies the wording of the Schedule as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Lady has not been able to accept the Amendment because it is one of some substance. We are discussing what is, in effect, a court of appeal. Once an application has been considered and rejected there is properly incorporated into the legislation a right of appeal. However, it does not seem to me, although there may not be many appeals, that the general tendency of these bodies will be to include rather than exclude, as the hon. Lady said. It seems contrary to natural justice that a Chairman who has played a part in the lower court, so to speak, should also be invited to play or be capable of playing a part in the higher court, because he is bound to influence the Council itself on the deliberations with which it is concerned. For the very good reason that all other members of the committee are excluded it seems to me all the more important that the Chairman ought to be excluded too, because if other members would have an influence with the Council as a whole, it must surely follow that the Chairman would have an even greater influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the applicant, when so many other built-in safeguards are to be found, the logical and proper safeguard of severing the two bodies should be maintained, and the Council should be able to look at the appeal, as it were,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot. The reason for the difference between us is that we have a different concept of what the committee will do.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier the hon. Lady called my attention to something which I ought to have noticed but did not. Had I noticed it I would certainly have tabled an Amendment. In paragraph 3(1) we find these words:
	<br><q><p>"No person shall take office as a member of the Council (whether on election or reelection) after attaining the age of 70 years."</p></q>
I do not know on which model this provision has been based, but we are here thinking about a Council of people who are to represent the new age—the dynamic, new technological age, and the rest of it—and all of us with experience of the teaching profession realise how</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
	<p>Friend the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) I agree entirely with my hon. and learned Friend that this is contrary to natural justice. If a case is heard and it goes forward to the second court, so to speak, the chairman of the first court should not be sitting in the second one giving advice to the rest of the Council.</p>
	<p>If the hon. Lady pursues her point of view, then, in fairness, she should allow all the members of the original committee to sit on the appeal committe, because then at least if there were arguments in favour of the person whose qualifications were in dispute they would be fairly put to the Council, whereas in the individual's case, however fairly the Chairman may try to put his case, the individual is bound to think that, because that person was in the chair when he lost his first case, he will be against him the next time. For this reason the hon. Lady should look at the matter again. No harm would be done.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Schedule:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>greatly it is biassed these days in favour of the younger ages. Whether or not we think this is right, this is so, and I cannot believe that the words in that provision provide the right sort of image for us to give the Teaching Council. A short while ago we accepted the idea that people elected to the Council should serve for a period of four years. We are now faying that it should be possible for somebody to be elected at the age of, say, 69 and carry on for four years, till the age of 73.</p>
	<p>I hope that the hon. Lady will consider between now and Report changing the figure of 70 to, say. 65. Indeed, I would be perfectly happy if she reduced it to 60. However, 65 is the age which I would regard as the oldest at which we

However, the age in paragraph 3(1) was recommended by the Wheatley Committee. We have tried to follow Wheatley in this respect.

If one looks at the provisions of the Schedule it is quite clear that there is set up here something closely relating to a court of law, and that is as it should be. This is a disciplinary body with substantial power, if not over the life of the people who are brought before it, then at least over their livelihood. It is only proper, therefore, that, as in other examples to be found in other professions, a body of this nature should be run along judicial lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find at the outset of the Schedule that it is stated that
	<br><q><p>"the Disciplinary Committee … may administer oaths".</p></q>
It goes on:
	<br><q><p>".… the Court of Session shall … have … power … to grant warrant for the citation of witnesses and havers"—</p></q>
who, as hon. Members will be aware, are holders of documents—
	<br><q><p>"to give evidence or to produce documents before the Committee …"</p></q>
which it is desirable to recover. It has all the paraphernalia of a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I wonder what is meant by the words it is suggested in the Amendment should be left out:
	<br><q><p>"and the rules of evidence to be observed".</p></q>
If this is to be a court of law, at least in the quasi-judicial sense, I should have thought that the rules of evidence to be followed would be the rules embodied in the law of evidence. Is it intended, for example, that this Committee, subject to the authority of the Lord President, should have power to vary what is at the moment the law of evidence? If that is the intention, the hon. Lady is wasting her time, because I am sure that the safeguards contained—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
