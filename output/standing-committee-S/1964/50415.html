Clause 3.—(DUTIES OF THE BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Further Amendment proposed [8th April],</i> In page 2, line 20, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"<i>(b)</i> to consult at regular intervals with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and adjacent areas and with other such bodies as appear to the Board to be appropriate".—<i>[Mr. G. Campbell.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last Thursday morning by the time we completed our Sitting I had already given the reasons why I did not find it possible to accept the Amendments which we were discussing, and I was about to make one point on this, the first, of the Amendments.<br><br>
It was quite clear that hon. and right hon. Members whose names were put to this first Amendment were very anxious to ensure that there would be consultation with local authorities and wished it to be written into the Bill, but I think a reading of last week's proceedings will have shown that the ideas about this were not at all clear. The desire for consultation was expressed, and expressed very forcefully, but the kind of consultation the form it would take and when it would take place, was not at all clear.<br><br>
We accept the necessity for consultation, but we feel that this would be brought about automatically by the fact that the Board is under a duty to consult local authorities and other bodies as appears to the Board to be appropriate. I also pointed out the danger which might arise if we made it statutory upon the Board to have regular, large meetings with local authorities.<br><br>
During the discussion one or two hon. Gentlemen opposite pointed to the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as appears to the Board to be appropriate"</p></blockquote>
and expressed certain misgivings about them. Having considered this matter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
further I am inclined to agree with them that, perhaps, they are not the happiest words, and I undertake to look at them again with the object of trying to find an alternative. I am not quite sure what the alternative might be, but it might be
<br><blockquote><p>"after such consultation with local authorities … and other bodies which are affected or concerned"</p></blockquote>
or something like that. After having read the debate, I am inclined to agree that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as appears to the Board to be appropriate"</p></blockquote>
are probably not the best we could have chosen, and we will look at them again.<br><br>
I think I have given the reasons why we cannot accept the Amendments as they stand, and I hope we can now come to some conclusion about them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that my hon. Friend who moved this Amendment would be grateful to the Minister for what he has said, because we felt it was important that consultation should take place with local authorities. We felt that this Amendment was a way of clearing a slightly ambiguous position in the Bill, and I am sure that my hon. Friend would wish to withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Member is not here to withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 27, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of consultation under this paragraph the Board shall have the power to request the Secretary of State to instruct other statutory bodies in the Highlands and Islands to afford the Board every co-operation".</p></blockquote>
This Amendment could well be defined as a probing Amendment. I do not expect the Minister to accept it, but I hope that in discussing it, which should not take very long, certain definite principles will be established and one or two points will be cleared up. It must be made quite clear that the Board is in a senior position in the Highlands and Islands; that it is not just a <i>primus inter pares,</i> as it were, but is the boss.<br><br>
It is an illusion to say that Government Departments and Government-sponsored bodies always co-operate with one another freely and generously. Frequently, they bargain very keenly and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
compete quite fiercely, and, naturally enough, they develop a certain vested interest in their own existence and a desire for their own preservation, as well as a sense of their own importance. I would think that a Board of this kind would inevitably stamp on a lot of toes, and I should not like to think that, if it stamped on the toes of any other body within the Highlands area, a situation might arise where the other statutory body would not be fully co-operative. This is an unlikely situation, but it is possible, and I wanted it to be made quite clear that the Board will be the dominant factor.<br><br>
For example, if the Board wished to second a member of the Crofters Commission or a member of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board for a specified period, to help them with a problem which they were studying or a project upon which they were engaged, I should have thought it would be a good thing if the Board definitely had the right to say to this other body, "You will please second So-and-So to us", which is reasonable. In other words, the Board should very definitely be in the stronger position with regard to other bodies concerned with development in the Highlands area.<br><br>
Finally, I should like the Minister to say one or two words about the relationship between the Board and other agencies already existing in the Highlands area. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State talked about the Board acting through the existing agencies and quoted the example of forestry. When one reads through the Bill one finds, for example, that inevitably because of the fairly wide powers which the Board is given in relation to land, it will be in quite a strong position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Forestry Commission. What would its position be, for example, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the White Fish Authority if it wanted to pursue the question of fish farming in the West Highland lochs? It does not have very specific powers over the sea. These are the kinds of questions which moved me to put down this Amendment, and I would much appreciate it if the Minister would clear up this line of thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The very short answer to the hon. Gentleman is that his Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
ment is not really necessary at all. Under paragraph <i>(d)</i> of this subsection the Board has power to advise the Secretary of State on matters about which it is concerned. As I have said in previous debates, there is a two-way traffic—from the Secretary of State, asking for advice from the Board on certain matters, and from the Board up to the Secretary of State. Therefore, if the Board wished to secure the co-operation of certain bodies in the Highlands, it could without this Amendment inform the Secretary of State of the necessity for that if the scheme is to be successful. The Secretary of State already has power to give other statutory bodies general directions. This power is contained in Statutes concerning the various statutory organisations in the Highlands. Therefore, the short answer is that there is no need at all for this Amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions, and the first related to the powers of the Board: was it to be a dominant body? I must say that we do not like the use of this expression "dominant body". The Board will be responsible for carrying out the functions which are here set forth, but we hope that there will not be any question of a dominant body.<br><br>
What we envisage happening is that the Board itself would take the initiative in preparing certain schemes. In the course of preparing them, it may be quite clear that certain things, which it considers should be done in connection with one of these schemes, ought to be done by some other statutory body. It might be a local authority; it might be another statutory body. The Board would then consult with that body, as the Board has an obligation to do under this Clause, and would say to it, "Look here, we are proposing to the Secretary of State that we should carry out a scheme of development in this area. We feel that it could best be done in this way. Certain works will be required and we expect you to be willing to undertake these works." The matter would be discussed between the statutory body and the Board, and we have no reason to think that the statutory body would try to hold up the work of the Board. There might be some discussions, particularly concerning finance, and in relation to this aspect the Board is given a certain amount of power and has power to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0533">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
assist. We would expect that these consultations would be carried on, and that the Board would reach some agreement with the other statutory body as to how it should play its part in carrying out a scheme. The proposal would then go to the Secretary of State, and after that the job would be done. That is how we visualise its working.<br><br>
It is not our intention that the Board should have power to say to the Crofters Commission or anyone else, "We want one of your staff and you will have to second him to us." If it were to want the services of staff, I should have thought that the Crofters Commission, for example, would be quite willing to lend to the Board one of its staff, perhaps for a week or two, if that were possible, or to give the Board any advice it wanted, without our placing this power with the Board. We feel that if we were to put the Board in this position, it would cause a lot of unnecessary antagonism and probably create a number of obstacles to getting done the work which we want the Board to undertake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very largely agree with the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps the word "request" should be stressed, because what the hon. Gentleman is asking for in this Amendment is that the Board would request the Secretary of State in the event of non-co-operation.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Suppose that there were a specific proposal for the development of a particular area. The scheme would go to the Secretary of State, who would approve it, and, clearly, the position relating to the other bodies involved would have been put to him. If he approves the scheme then there is also an obligation to see that the work is carried out. The Board has been given the obligation and the Secretary of State has been brought into the picture. The result would probably be as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). The Board would probably impose its view on the local authorities, but we do not expect them to be recalcitrant. Although there might be difficulty about certain points, they would not wish not to co-operate. The Board would say to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
them, "We expect the scheme to go ahead and you to play the part you agreed to play." That is how we envisage the Board operating.<br><br>
It is all very difficult to foretell. We have tried to visualise this as clearly as we could, but till the Board is functioning and one sees the exact nature of the obstacles or difficulties which might arise it is not easy to be specific. I have, however, tried to give as specific a picture as possible as to how we think the Board will work.<br><br>
After the discussions we held in Inverness with the various bodies concerned, including the local authorities, we have no reason to think that it will not work like this. It would be true to say that those we met are anxious to see the Board established and get going and they expressed their willingness to co-operate with it. It is also true to say that, in the past, these bodies have not shown an unwillingness to do things. Rather have there been certain difficulties in other directions.<br><br>
That is why we do not foresee great difficulties in achieving already what the Amendment seeks to achieve. There is, therefore, no need for the Amendment, because the powers are already in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one point on which I agree with the Minister of State and disagree with the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston).<br><br>
The Minister of State was probably giving it as an illustration of the effect of the Amendment when he said that the Board would be able to say to some other authority in the Highlands, "You have a very good general manager. We want him." Knowing how difficult these sorts of people are to get in the Highlands I can see that sort of thing leading to considerable confusion and that, I agree, should not be the effect of any Amendment we agree to.<br><br>
But I am in some difficulty, and I understand the difficulty of the Minister of State about this. Getting things done in the Highlands almost traditionally is better done by co-operation than by firm instruction. On the other hand, I believe that the people in the Highlands are looking forward to the establishment of the Board, but have the strong feeling—and I think that the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
Inverness will agree—that the Board should be the principal source of advice to the Secretary of State and not the dominant body.<br><br>
At the moment the Secretary of State has the power to give general directions to various statutory bodies. It is always easy to argue whether a specific idea one has in mind is a general direction or not. I think that what the people in the Highlands are hoping will emerge is that this Board will have the power to look at Highland problems as a whole and to decide how best an area or section in the Highlands should be designed and planned for the use of forestry, fishing, and the rest.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister of State that the Amendment is unnecessary in the context of the Bill as it stands, because, and I think he will agree, the Bill gives all powers to the Secretary of State, and whether we like it or not, the Secretary of State is the dominant body in Scotland. What follows from that is that many of us would like to see the Board given more initiative in certain directions and be less under the thumb of the Secretary of State, so that it should at least be able to say to him, for instance, that it feels that the Forestry Commission is planting too much timber in one area and that it would be better planted in another because there it could be grown more easily, for instance, or better transported to the pulp mill at Fort William.<br><br>
I am not sure that the Secretary of State, with his statutory powers, has the authority to say to the Forestry Commission that it must not plant here or there. In my view, that would involve day to day management by the Forestry Commission. All of us hope that, if the Board is run by understanding and sensible people, with an overall vision to the benefit of the Highlands, someone, and probably the Board, should be the authority which has the power to say to the Forestry Commission through the Secretary of State, "This is where we want to see new development taking place".<br><br>
I do not suggest that the hon. Gentleman should accept the Amendment as it is, but I hope he will think about this point carefully. One does need, perhaps, rather more specific powers, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
the hands, I would hope, of the Board rather than those of the Secretary of State, for co-ordinating this sort of thinking and getting something done. If the Forestry Commission or a local authority or some other body had other views, the Board should have the final say, rather than be the dominant body. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will think about this. It may be a very difficult problem to write some such provision into the Bill, but I think the Highland people would want it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Amendment has been too widely read. We are merely asking that, for the purposes of ensuring proper consultation only, the Board shall have virtually a reserve power to go direct to the Secretary of State where it is unable to get co-operation from statutory bodies for consultation purposes. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has given examples of difficulties in actual projects. The Board, at this stage, only asks for consultation in the Amendment. We are asking only for a reserve power to go to the Secretary of State if statutory bodies do not co-operate in consultation. It is at that very early state that the hon. Members sponsoring this Amendment are trying to safeguard the Board's rights. It is a fundamental need that the Board shall have the right of, at least, consultation with other statutory bodies. We are asking for it to have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State where such bodies are recalcitrant and not willing to consult.<br><br>
To ask a body to consult with the Board is not asking much—indeed, it is a matter of common decency that such a request should be acceded to, and it normally is. But if a case arises where, for example, some vested interest unreasonably obstructs or causes a body to refuse even to consult, the Board should then have the right to go to the Secretary of State and say, "This organisation will not even consult us and therefore we cannot even begin to plan our project." Something should be written in to the guarantee the right of the Board to protect itself from such obstruction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment refers to statutory bodies. What
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
statutory bodies has the hon. Member in mind which could cause difficulties of this sort?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman has been in local government and I hope that I am not touching a soft spot, but we have had some trouble in the past with Highland and other local authorities when Secretaries of State have tried to get them to co-operate on useful schemes. The record of co-operation in the Highlands is somewhat less than 100 per cent. Pressures can be brought to bear, I agree, but it will be difficult to operate such pressures unless something is written in to oblige statutory bodies, where need arises—including local authorities—to consult with the Board.<br><br>
I want to include all statutory bodies in this and I do not see why local authorities should be exempt. It would not be reasonable for any statutory body, elected or otherwise, to refuse to consult. But the case was put admirably by my hon. Friend the Minister of State when discussing the Local Government (Development and Finance) (Scotland) Act 1964. He took as his example the difficulties created by certain bodies when it came to seeking to advance tourist industry regional amenities, with access to land in the Highlands and Islands. The sponsor of that Bill was the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) who was, happily, with us on earlier occasions in this Committee. My hon. Friend pointed out that there are in the Highlands organisations like the Scottish Landowners' Association, or like Aims of Industry, Ltd., as well as other organisations which are not elected or answerable to the public in any way but who dominate some local authorities. It was almost impossible at times to move without the co-operation of Aims of Industry.<br><br>
This sort of thing happens from time to time in the Highlands. Amongst statutory bodies one may sometimes find local authorities which may be difficult and unhelpful. I accept that the Amendment should be narrow. We are trying here, therefore, to ensure that the Board has the right to go to the Secretary of State to overcome any unreasonable obstruction to consultation—and we certainly maintain that refusal even to consult would almost always be unreasonable.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree very much with the remarks made by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) on this Amendment. The Amendment as worded could not have my support because it envisages a situation which will not arise, at any rate in some of the activities of the Board.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister of State referred to fish farming. The White Fish Authority is already dealing with this, has taken certain decisions and will take more. I would not like the situation to develop in which, because the Highland Board has been set up, this excellent preparatory work which is just about to culminate, I believe, in some development in the Highland area would be frustrated in any way. Thus, in connection with fish farming and the White Fish Authority I would prefer that the Board should co-operate with the White Fish Authority in order to get a bigger and better economy, possibly by greater financial inducements for this particular work. I am sure the Minister of State would agree with me that the Board would be there ready to support the White Fish Authority and to back it in every way it could, but would not seek to take over its domestic problems.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that if the Board went along to the White Fish Authority merely to consult about some perfectly reasonable proposal and the White Fish Authority said "No", even to mere consultation, the power should not be denied to the Board then to go on appeal to the Secretary of State to ask for some pressure to be applied to that body? That is all that is being suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said he could envisage possibilities of a dispute occurring between the Board and the local authority. That may be, but should not the local authority have the right to say what it thinks and act accordingly? My other point is this. I think that it is unwise to write into a Bill of this sort too much detail and not give scope for ordinary adjustments. It would be an error to write into the Bill too much of a detailed nature.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To answer the hon. Gentleman's question I do not envisage a dispute at this stage with the local or other statutory authority. What can happen, of course, is that one local authority may be slow or obstructive or inefficient in the matter of consultation when perhaps all the other authorities in an area are willing at least to consult for the general good. When a case like that arises, as it can arise, it is a matter of having an agency which possesses power to press the local authority to consult as a matter of reasonable arrangement with the Board, along with other local authorities and statutory bodies. That agency is the Secretary of State. That is all that I am saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with a great deal that has been said, and I would make the point which I made when I first spoke. The Secretary of State has these powers. In respect to most statutory bodies he can give them directions of general character to say that they should consult. Therefore, there is no need to put this into the Bill again. That really is the short answer.<br><br>
I was asked whether the Board would have the power, if it found that some statutory body was not willing to consult, to go direct to the Secretary of State. Of course it has power to go directly to him, and that is implicit in paragraph <i>(d).</i> If a particular body refuses to consult, the Board can say, "We cannot get the information we require on this" and the Secretary of State would then have to consider what he would do about that sort of situation. He may have to remind the body of the general direction he has given that it should enter into consultations with the Board. However, assuming that the Board cannot get that consultation, the Board can still go to the Secretary of State. The fact that the Secretary of State has approved a scheme indicates that there is an obligation on the Board itself, which is the executive body for carrying out the scheme, and there is also an obligation on the Secretary of State to see that it is carried out, for he has a responsibility to the House to see that the work is done. As the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said, the Secretary of State does in fact have the powers. He is the dominant factor in all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
this, as the right hon. Gentleman knows from his own experience.<br><br>
In connection with the question asked by my hon. Friend about the White Fish Authority, quite clearly one would not expect the Board, in fact one would not want the Board, to go to the White Fish Authority if it were carrying out experiments related to fish farming to try to take over the Authority's job, but one would expect that, if the White Fish Authority wanted assistance and cooperation in expanding or developing such a scheme, that it would approach the Board and say, "We are engaged on this work and should like to expand the work for these specific reasons", and then would give them. It is up to the Board to reach some suitable agreement with the White Fish Authority in order to help. One does not expect the Board to dictate to other people; one expects it to co-operate with the other bodies. This is what the Bill seeks to do. One has no reason to think that this will not be carried out.<br><br>
One knows that there may well be difficulties and that some of the bodies concerned may find difficulties in doing what the Board would like them to do. Therefore, they have to discuss all those difficulties, whether they be financial or whatever they may be, and decide how they can be solved. This is the sort of question that can be resolved as a result of consultation. If it is not resolved, then when the scheme goes to the Secretary of State, the proposal would state, "We have had consultations with such-and-such a body on this matter, but have failed to reach agreement for such-and-such a reason. Our proposals are these." Then the Secretary of State will have to make up his mind what he is going to do about it. He may say, "I am happy with these proposals, which seem to be sound", and he would inform the local authority or other body that he had approved the proposal and would expect them to co-operate in carrying it forward. That is how it would work, as we see it at the present time.<br><br>
On the matter of the Forestry Commission, I understand that the Secretary of State, by virtue of the fact that he acquires the land so as to place it at the disposal of the Commission, determines where it should plant, but the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
Forestry Commission does not necessarily plant all of the area, and there might be many acres which were not planted. But the Secretary of State controls the acquisition, and can refuse to acquire, and to some extent does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister clarify this point? The Forestry Commission land is acquired by the Secretary of State, but the Forestry Commission aims, and often succeeds, at planting many estates dotted all over the Highlands. The point arises that the Secretary of State could hardly say to the Forestry Commission, "You will not plant on the east coast of Ross and Cromarty, you will plant on the west coast at Lochailart", for that would be a specific direction rather than a general one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that probably the right hon. Gentleman is right, but there is a check in these matters and there are discussions. Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture would also have some say in what land is to be planted.<br><br>
I believe I have answered all the points which have been raised. I would only remind the Committee that all the powers which have been suggested this morning in this discussion are in fact in the Bill, but although these powers are there, we hope and expect, and we have no reason to think otherwise, that the process will carry on on the basis of negotiation, consultation and good relationship; rather than on bad relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member wish to withdraw the Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Steele. I think that the Minister was most courteous and informative in his reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would advise hon. Members that the acoustics in this Room are very difficult, and we have to try to assist the shorthand reporters and others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. That is the second time I have been checked for speaking too quietly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a Liberal trait.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been a short but useful discussion. I very much apprecciated the way in which the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) developed the arguments as thoroughly as he did,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
for he has much greater experience in his particular field than I have. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 28, to leave out "or undertake" and to insert "in the undertaking of".<br><br>
I can feel that the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) may think this is the start of one of those ideological clashes to which he looks forward with so much enthusiasm in this Committee, but the words of the Clause are extremely wide. It may be that they are intended to be extremely wide, and it is right that the Committee should debate the problem of what it is we want the Board to do.<br><br>
It is suggested in subsection (l,<i>c</i>) that the Board will have the duties—"to concert, promote, assist". These are all things with which everybody would agree. "Concert" would amount to the sort of consultation, and so on, of which we have heard a good deal. "Promote" would, perhaps, mean being able to go to various people and say, "We believe that this is a good plan, will you carry it out?" "Assist", in the Highlands generally, means to assist with money, but occasionally it may mean assisting with staff. Basically the conception is either to provide the money to get the scheme going or occasionally to provide the people to help to do it.<br><br>
Then one comes to the words
<br><blockquote><p>"or undertake measures to implement any proposals so approved".</p></blockquote>
These words as written into the subsection suggest that we are giving to the Board the widest possible opportunities for carrying on any type of business or operation, industrial, commercial, or anything else, which it might from time to time wish to do.<br><br>
Of course, as the Minister of State has said, it is the Secretary of State who has the powers to direct the Board to do things. We are, in fact, giving the Secretary of State complete and absolute authority, if my interpretation of these words is right, to do anything in the Highlands that he wants to do. This is a feature of this Bill which should not be glossed over. It is one on which we want to know exactly where we are going.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
I understand the difficulties of the Minister of State in telling us the sort of people whom he wants to have on the Board, but we have had an indication that they are to be a small number, some four or five people. If the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and I had our way at least 90 per cent. of them would be full-time. They are the people who are in a position actually to carry out the operation, perhaps on the instructions of the Secretary of State. The words in the Clause being so wide one might end up with a much larger Board with an enormous staff. I believe this gives them power to run tweed mills, fish farms, Forestry Commission operations, all these things in the Highlands for which they will have neither the required knowledge nor the staff.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
We on this side of the Committee consider that with a Board of that size, and I hope a Board of quality, one does not envisage an enormous sort of I.C.I. structure, nor does the Minister envisage that it should carry out these sorts of things on an enormous scale. We believe that its function is to obtain the help and co-operation of agencies or private enterprise or other people, because we believe that in this way the things will be best done, cheapest done, and quickest done.<br><br>
If this is the ideological struggle to which the hon. Member for Fife, West refers then I am not ashamed to say that we on this side of the Committee would rather see it done our way than his. Naturally he is not in any way expected to agree with me, but I think the experience we have had of a number of things in the Highlands, run both by the State and by private enterprise, has shown both can succeed and both can fail. There is no single way to glory in this respect.<br><br>
I think it would be useful and helpful if the Minister were able, quite quickly, to indicate to the Committee at an early stage of the debate whether he agrees that the power to
<br><blockquote><p>"undertake measures to implement any proposal so approved"</p></blockquote>
is, as I read it, a completely blank cheque for the Board, through the Secretary of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
State, to carry out any type of operation it wants. If it is not that, and his intention is that it should make proposals and help other people to do things, but not carry out the manufacturing, the growing of trees, the growing of fish, the production of whisky, and so on, then we might well save a good deal of time which might otherwise be wasted through our not being quite certain whether these words which, I am told, are absolutely open are intended so to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say that the right hon. Gentleman can be complimented on not missing one trick when it comes to watching the interests of those he is in fact here to represent, namely the interests of private enterprise and the people who are opposed to almost anything other than private enterprise. There is no doubt that this part of the Bill means, or ought to mean, as far as the Highlands and Islands people are concerned. If the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment were carried, with all the implications contained in it, we might as well scrap this Bill right now and forget all the additional sittings.<br><br>
As one of the few Members for the Highlands with anything like an overall majority I can say that the people of the Highlands expect that this Board will be a powerful and effective instrument of development. In the hands of the Board and Secretary of State it could be made such an instrument, able and equipped to do jobs which neither private enterprise nor public agencies are doing at the present time.<br><br>
It is all right for the right hon. Gentleman to say that private enterprise can do things better, more cheaply and more efficiently; but the fact is that this Bill and this Board really is necessary because private enterprise is not doing them at all in the Highlands and Islands. This is a large part of the trouble. That is why there is a high, persistent level of unemployment in areas like Stornoway, Shetland and other areas. There is no question here of some sudden ideological Labour Party campaign which the right hon. Gentleman has dreamed up, taking place. In fact, I do not see that private enterprise in the Highlands and Islands is working at any sort of speed which could allow even the most optimistic of Tories to rejoice. Our complaint, indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
is that neither private nor public enterprise has operated as efficiently or effectively in the Highlands as to satisfy the need for development or to prevent consistent and heavy unemployment in those areas.<br><br>
What is the right hon. Gentleman worried about? He says this Clause would give the Board, and therefore the Minister, who, as always, hitherto, has all the final reserve powers, the power to undertake any business large or small, from a factory to a farm, or anything of that sort. If the new Board went into my constituency and said, "The Secretary of State wants to run a fish farm here in order to help to relieve your unemployment", they would all whoop with joy. If a private firm came along, or I.C.I.—and I do not see why I.C.I, should be ruled out almost by definition by the right hon. Gentleman—and said they were going to start it up, the people would equally welcome it, of course, just the same as they would in any other place. I do not see what the right hon. Gentleman's fear is of I.C.I, or other bigger operator coming along.<br><br>
If one refers to some of these vast organisations as "private enterprise" one is surely begging the question, anyway. When we think of normal local private enterprise in the ordinary sense of the term and then look at the mighty scale on which I.C.I, and other great organisations are operating, it soon becomes obvious that their very purpose is to eliminate private or other competition and to establish themselves on the ever grander scale. Eventually, they wipe out small competing businesses altogether. Of course that is what is happening. It may not be the declared and open aim and purpose of I.C.I, and the great syndicates and cartels, but it is the effect of their method of operation and development and ultimately we end up with a few great monopolies in private hands, not answerable to the House of Commons or anybody else, and certainly something far worse than the Secretary of State, or Highland Development Board, who can all be sacked by the electorate, which I.C.I, cannot be.<br><br>
Apart from all that, the right hon. Gentleman is needlessly alarmed. If he looks at the Clause more carefully he will see that by the time we reach
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
this part of this subsection the Board will already have consulted with the local authorities. More than that, it will have consulted with the appropriate bodies which are relevant to the proposals which it is putting forward, and if my hon. Friend accepts the Amendment moved today it will be extending even further the field of consultation with such bodies. By the time any proposals for any development have reached the Secretary of State they will have gone through all these processes of democratic approval, and by that time they must also receive the approval of the Secretary of State, who in turn is answerable to the House of Commons and to Parliament, which in turn is elected by the totality of the electorate of this country.<br><br>
So there is nothing arbitrary, sudden or dictatorial about this. We have gone through all these democratic processes of consultation, discussion, approval and all the rest from the Board and the local authorities and there is no question of arbitrary and sudden decisions being taken on a purely ideological impulse on the part of the Government, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, just because the Labour Government happens to be in office. So the right hon. Gentleman has nothing very much to worry about there. All those safeguards are there and unless he wishes to put in new safeguards which have never been considered so far on either side of the Committee, then I do not see what he is worrying about in that respect.<br><br>
However when it comes to the substance of this Clause I hope the Minister will not dream of weakening it. Indeed I am sure that, having already given the assurance which he has given to this Committee on previous Amendments regarding industrial initiatives, participation in industrial operations by the Board, and all the rest of it, my hon. Friend will not want to weaken the Board at this stage or weaken the purpose and effect of his Bill. It would indeed be a day of gloom and misery in the Highlands if we started to modify and dilute the clear undertakings he has already given and which are strengthened further in Clauses 6 and 7 and later.<br><br>
I am not going to underestimate the importance of the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment. It would be discourteous of me if I did so; but he is trying to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
prevent the Board from having powers to do things which neither public nor private enterprise and agencies of any kind are now doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This would be a Very attractive argument if it were right, but what the powers do is not to give the Board power to do things which other people are not doing; it gives it power to do everything, whether or not other people are already doing it efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said a lot about that in an earlier speech in which we discussed broadly this same point in regard to the duty and power of the Board to take industrial initiative and carry on industry. I do not see why the Board should not do certain things which other private or public agencies are now doing, or not doing. Let me give the reason that would justify my last comments completely. There are areas in the Highlands and Islands in which certain agencies, private or otherwise, are doing certain things. There are other areas, neglected and undeveloped, where these things are not being done and are clearly not going to be done because it is not attractive for private enterprise to go into those areas, for reasons of geography or the likelihood of not being able to make a profit, and public agencies have not done their duty. Therefore I cannot see even a dog in the manger justification for preventing a Board of this kind from doing things similar to what are being done by public and private enterprise elsewhere in some areas, but are not being done in the undeveloped areas. I cannot see what argument the right hon. Gentleman can put up against that.<br><br>
There are many things which are being done successfully in some areas but which are not likely to be duplicated by private firms in others—and yet are essential. I gave an example at our last Sitting. It was a very simple example and I do not think the right hon. Gentleman would object to it because after all the Herring Industry Board was not a socialist idea based on any ideological concept. It was set up without partisan argument, and the right hon. Gentleman and all his hon. Friends were apparently, quite glad to have an agency doing something which private enterprise was not likely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
or able to do. Here is my example, then. I would like to see the herring industry doing the same thing in Barra as they are doing in Stornoway—processing herring for various purposes in their plants. For the benefit of any hon. Member who does not know, Barra is at the southern end of the Outer Hebrides and there, at one time, we used to have a flourishing herring fishing industry. In the early May market the herring was a very profitable product in the American market, and still would be if it were properly developed. That industry has declined through private and other neglect. Now the Herring Board is not doing processing in Barra, as it does in Stornoway; but it would be an excellent thing that there should be duplication in Barra of the Board's Stornoway activities. I do not think there would be any objection to that from anyone.<br><br>
Therefore I do not think the right hon. Gentleman is very worried about duplicating, as he said, the work of public agencies or departments in various parts of the Highlands. He is not worried about the Board coming into competition with the Forestry Commission at certain points. There is no reason why the Board should not, for example, do in certain places where the Forestry Commission is not doing it, some of the things which the Forestry Commission has been doing elsewhere.<br><br>
To take an example, very shortly. The Forestry Commission, is, obviously, the agency for the planting of timber. On the other hand it has shown, through the years, great reluctance to undertake non-commercial scale plantations. I know the right hon. Gentleman did help in this respect and I say that to his credit, and a great deal of pressure has been brought through the years, notably by the Scottish Department, on the Forestry Commission to undertake schemes of planting, and shelter belts in association with the hill farming schemes, and so on. But through the years the Forestry Commission has been extremely reluctant to undertake smaller scale plantations, partly because they were regarded as uneconomic, and for reasons of general inconvenience to the Forestry Commission. They would hardly look at anything less than 300 or 400 acres. I have made speeches on this subject before the war and on many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0541">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
occasions since then; and I am assuming also that the subject is as familiar to hon. Members as it is to myself. In later years the Forestry Commission has been pressed to undertake smaller schemes and has done so. Now I notice that the Forestry Commission has expressed itself, I think with the strong encouragement of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, as being prepared to re-survey in the Lewis area, which it would not look at seriously till now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not object to the hon. Member making a passing reference to the Forestry Commission but he is now dealing with a great deal of the work of that Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the Forestry Commission and one is bound to talk, therefore, about trees, though perhaps we do not now see the wood for the trees quite as clearly as we did when I started.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Duplication of the work of the Forestry Commission in the planted areas by the Forestry Commission itself in other un-planted areas is highly desirable. Some of us have always advocated this. If the Forestry Commission is not prepared to do shelter planting in certain exposed areas in the interests of agriculture, tourism, even of amenity and all the other things about which we talk here, then there seems to me to be no reason on earth for arguing against the Highlands Development Board doing that type and scale of work as well. I know it could not itself provide the experts, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, but it could co-operate with the Forestry Commission itself and make its work easier by helping to organise labour and finance and formulating the schemes in general, leaving the actual expertise and staff of the Forestry Commission to do the specialised jobs. These are examples of where duplication of public agencies working in areas where they are not working at present at all would be extremely useful.<br><br>
That is not really what the right hon. Gentleman is against. What he is afraid of is that someone in the Isle of Barra, or the Island of Jura, or in the North-East Islands or some particular
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
area in the Highlands and Islands where private enterprise is doing nothing and public enterprise is doing likewise, may set up some sort of factory, some sort of enterprise or undertaking which might conceivably compete with private enterprise. That is a dog-in-a-manger attitude. It is worse than that: It is a dog-in-the-vicinity-of-the-manger attitude. It does not want any other animal but itself to be anywhere within the region of the stables. This is really what the right hon. Gentleman is getting at. This is an issue of principle with him and his hon. Friends in defence of private profit and enterprise. This attitude is ideological. Their attitude is Highland developments be damned as long as private enterprise is interfered with in any way in an area where it is at its most inefficient, is most unwilling to develop and where it has most betrayed the interest of the people all the way through from the landlords to the manufacturers.<br><br>
There is almost no example of real private enterprise related to real risk in any way, as far as I am aware, at this moment in most areas of the Highlands which has been started in the last five years. There is only one I can think of where private enterprise investment went in with a real risk element, and that is the Ceemo firm of the Perrins family in Stornoway. That is a very gallant effort. However, because of the lack of guidance by some agencies which also could have helped them with tide-over capital for a short period in their difficulties, that firm may well be going out of being just now.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a strong case, in the interests of private enterprise itself, for some agency to do the jobs the Government agencies are not doing, which private enterprise and the banks are not prepared to take the risk of doing, even to assist or rescue private firms, and which even the Highland Fund cannot do, and is clearly not going to risk its own funds in this case. There surely is a case not only for development by public undertakings but also actual operation—and I hope for profit—of industrial and manufacturing enterprises by a board of this kind. There may also be a good case for assistance for private and other undertakings which are running into difficulties.<br><br>
What we are considering here is not only the case for public or private enterprise, but the development of the area,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0542">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
the elimination of the lower reward standards prevailing in that area compared with urban standards of reward and living and the provision of employment on a continuous, and, I hope, insurable basis in the future for as great a number of the people as possible in areas which have hitherto been neglected and suffered from heavy unemployment. I hope that is commendable to everyone.<br><br>
I cannot see what case, other than one of purely narrow ideological obstruction, would sustain the right hon. Gentleman in pressing this Amendment. I hope my hon. Friend the Minister of State will stand by all he has said already about the Governments intention that the Board shall operate as a high-powered instrument of the nation, with power to undertake both public jobs and, despite what hon. Gentleman opposite say, other jobs which have long been the exclusive right of private enterprise to do and which have been left undone. I hope they will go into the whole field as require in the national interest and when it is desirable in the public interest to do so. We are thinking now of the interests of the Highlands as a whole and of the country, not of private profit makers alone.<br><br>
The intention and purpose of the whole Bill is to raise standards in the Highlands and Islands, to produce more wealth, and, by so doing, to give a greater contribution to the overall national wealth. In doing that, I hope the Board will not be hampered by any consideration of private greed or private monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has said that this is a matter of ideological principle. I would entirely agree with that. I think it is clearly a matter of ideological principle. However, I would suggest that if the boot were on the other foot and the Amendment had been in the Bill, the party opposite would be perfectly at liberty to put down an Amendment to make the Bill read as it does at present. No one would quarrel with that; it is their right.<br><br>
The new wording, if this Amendment is accepted, would be as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"to concert, promote and assist in the undertaking of measures to implement any pro-proposals so approved".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
It might be said that the words "promote" and "undertake" are continuing words; in other words, if we promote, we must undertake. I do not think that is so at all. Promotion means, in the words of the Minister of State, initiating. We have no quarrel whatever with the Board initiating things. What we have a quarrel with is the Board's initiating and then carrying out.<br><br>
I take it that no one quarrels with the fact that Government money—public money—is going to be involved in all this. Certainly it is. However, the party opposite thinks the Secretary of State—and I think this is the vitally important point—via the Board should be able to spend that money. In other words, the party opposite says ideologically and, to its mind, correctly, that the State should run any of the industries which are set up.<br><br>
The classic example of our case is that of the pulp mill at Fort William. Public money was involved there. This was not entirely to assist private enterprise. It was set up to help the people of that area. It was set up to help the producers of timber, and so on, to get an outlet for their products. If we pursue this further, it might be said that if a person, either through taxation or from his own pocket, educates his child, then he should expect, when that child leaves school and is fully trained, to recoup to his own pocket the excess money the grown child earns, having paid his or her living expenses.<br><br>
I fundamentally disagree with nationalisation. If the Board undertakes enterprises and public money is involved, what is the difference between that and pure, outright nationalisation? There is no guarantee that the nationalised running of industries is going to be of help or, indeed, is going to stabilise the population as it is, or, indeed, bring more people back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Already many parts of the Highlands have proved the worth of nationalisation—through the work of the Hydro-Electric Board and the Forestry Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Forestry Commission is, undoubtedly, doing a great deal of good work, as, indeed, has been exemplified today. No one would deny that there is a great deal of further scope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0543">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
for the Forestry Commission in the Highlands, and, indeed, in many other areas as well.<br><br>
I should like to turn, if I may, for one second to the farming side of this. If the Board so advises the Secretary of State that a tract of land is suitable for development then, as I see it, the Board can take over that tract of land and farm it. Do the Government envisage that it will be done under the auspices of this Board, or will it be done under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture in Scotland? That, to my mind, is not at all clear, but one or other must do it.<br><br>
The Minister of State on 8th April said—and I am paraphrasing his words—that the Clause puts an obligation on the Board to initiate action. He went on later to say that its responsibility is to initiate action. That is good, and I would entirely agree with it if it stayed there. My idea of the Board is that it would be a co-ordinating body; it would be a planning body; it will have experts of various kinds on it. From the experience of those members who are serving on the Board, it can initiate enterprises and undertakings, all with a view to stabilising the population and, indeed, to attracting people back to the area. The Minister of State later in his speech on that same morning said that we do not want the Board to get bogged down in yet another long-term plan. Certainly not, but if it is going to be enabled to initiate, then it must have certain information at hand, and that, I would suggest, is its prime function, collecting information, disseminating it, and encouraging other people to get on with the job.<br><br>
As I see it, there are various main difficulties in the Clause as it stands. There is no evidence whatever that the Board will be anything else but an appendix of the Secretary of State and another Department of St. Andrew's House. To my mind, that Board is not a suitable body—cannot be a suitable body—to act as an employer or to carry out plans itself.<br><br>
Secondly, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) mentioned in his speech, to undertake various enterprises will require an enormous staff. For instance, if buildings are to be put up, factories possibly, and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
Board is to do the carrying out of the work, such people as clerks, workers, and so on, will be needed to oversee the work on behalf of the Board. I think that the duty of such a Board is to initiate, in conjunction with those interested local authorities, local firms, and so on, and to get the thing going in a businesslike manner.<br><br>
I wonder what the Government really see this Board as. It is not clear from the statement of the Minister of State exactly the manner in which they think the Board will function. Do they want it to be a do-gooder? Do they want it to be a vast commercial empire? Or do they want to see it, as I would like to see it, as a sensible co-ordinating and initiating agent?<br><br>
I would suggest that initiation is the key here, and not, as this subsection says, undertaking. I do not think that this subsection can be seen in isolation from the rest of the Bill, particularly in respect to Clause 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman in connection with promotion of enterprise and undertakings whether his view is that the Board shall come along, hand over public money, and then clear out once it has got the undertaking on its feet, leaving other people, without any continuing public interest at all, to share the profits, to go in and take the swag? Is that what he means?</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, certainly not. If any body, whether it be a nationalised board or a firm, initiates this, it does not lose interest in the thing, and it naturally has a right, as a public body, to see what is going on. But I do not say that their interest should go on to the managerial level, and to the carrying out of whatever project is in mind.<br><br>
With regard to the Forestry Commission, unless the Board recruits foresters of varying degrees of experience, qualifications and so on—and I think the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) would agree with this—it cannot actually plant trees, and nobody would disagree with this, but the Board can surely see that people who want to do the work, either privately or in conjunction with the Forestry Commission, are able to get on with it. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
we pushed this argument to its final conclusion, it could mean that the Board would become farmers, foresters, fishers and so on. If it wants to undertake any new industry, as undoubtedly it will under the present terms of the Bill, then we must safeguard the interests of those who are working in the area, and the only way of doing that is by passing this Amendment. In my opinion, this solution will be advantageous to the Board, if for no other reason than that we are more likely to get more reasonable men appointed to the Board when the time comes. I have pleasure in supporting the Amendment, and I trust that it will be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Gentlemen opposite ought to make up their minds. Every day in the House they ask us when we are going to implement our promises. When we start to implement our promises, they give us all the arguments for why we should not do so. This is a promise which we made at the Election, and it is one which we intend to carry out. The promise, very simply, was that we would set up a Board; that we would give it powers to do things that other bodies could not do, or where the sphere of other bodies did not extend. We believe that if the Board is to be effective it must have these powers.<br><br>
All the time that I was in the Highlands at the commencement of this year, I was told, "You must give the Board teeth." I heard this phrase until I was almost tired of it, but, of course, it expressed the desire to have a Board with powers to get on with the job if other people were not prepared to do it. This does not mean that the Board will take over the job of every organisation functioning in the Highlands, and undertake all the work that could be done by private enterprise or anything of that kind. It means that in putting forward its proposals for the development of an area—proposals which will be approved by the Secretary of State and which the Board is then under an obligation to implement—the Board will be given powers to implement the proposals, whether or not somebody says, "I am going to work here. I shall carry out this work for you."<br><br>
The Highland Panel has recently issued a report which recommended that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
there should be certain areas of land reclaimed as large pilot schemes. It has not got powers to do this work at the present time. If this is to be done, the land has to be acquired and the Government has to do it; and, clearly, if the Highlands Board is set up it will be the appropriate body to do it. Of course, it might use the services of outside private enterprise firms to do the work, and it would be very foolish if it tried to set up a lot of rival organisations when private enterprise was capable and willing to do the work. Nobody in his senses would do that.<br><br>
But we have got to ask ourselves: What would happen if private enterprise were not prepared to do the job? Then the scheme would fall through. What would happen if a landowner were not prepared to co-operate? I am not saying that he would not. I hope that landowners will co-operate, and the great majority probably will. But we have all heard of landowners who have not shown a great desire in this direction. Are we then to say that, because somebody has refused to co-operate, we can do nothing and the development has to be held up? Is this what hon. Gentlemen opposite want? This is not what the people in the Highlands want—at least, so far as I have been able to judge their views, and I have been going there for a very long time and talking to them, particularly since the present Government were elected. They have been expecting this Bill and they want the Board to have power to do these things. Of course, we would use private enterprise; of course, we would use all the agencies available; of course, we do not want the Board cluttered up with a lot of work that could better be done by people who are willing to do it.<br><br>
There are numerous examples, and I have quoted the case of reclamation. Let us take the case of the Brora coalmine, which is an example of what can happen. The owner of the Brora coalmine gave up, and the Highland Fund had to take over the mine for a time until its future could be arranged. If we are faced with another incident like that, is the Board not to have power to run a project like that until it can arrange satisfactorily for its running? In the Brora case, a workers' co-operative was formed in the end, but in the interim
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
period the mine had to be taken over by the Highland Fund until something could be done.<br><br>
One of my hon. Friends quoted what has been happening in his own constituency. One knows of incidents occurring in which one feels that the Board ought to have power, if it is in the interests of an area to maintain something which is about to close. I do not think anyone would quarrel with that. But also, of course, if it is to prepare schemes for the development of a particular area, it must be given powers to do what it considers necessary to develop the area. In the initial stages, it might not be possible to get private enterprise to undertake the work. Is the Board not to be given powers to do this? I think that the Board should be given powers.<br><br>
Of course, the Board is not free to do absolutely as it likes, as my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles pointed out. It has to consult first, the scheme has to be approved by the Secretary of State, and under certain Clauses of the Bill it has to be approved by the Treasury. All these are safeguards against the wild action that hon. Gentlemen seem to fear. There are safeguards in the Bill against the abuse of the power, but certainly we feel that the Board must be given this power if it is to carry out its remit properly.<br><br>
We cannot accept this Amendment. There is a difference between the two sides of the Committee on this matter, and I do not know the extent to which we should carry on debating this difference. That decision is in the hands of the Committee, of course, but I do not think all the debating in the world will help, and I hope we can proceed fairly rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to echo the last of the Minister's remarks, that as far as possible we should keep ideological warfare out of this Committee's proceedings. I do not think the people in the Highlands will appreciate a long debate on nationalisation <i>versus</i> non-nationalisation. The specific point about which this Amendment is concerned raises much wider and larger issues. It is important that we advance in every possible way in the Highlands. The example of pulp was quoted by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker). This is a good
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
example of private enterprise. There was a long discussion and eventually the firm was loaned money.<br><br>
If the Board is of the opinion that something comparable is desirable, and indeed necessary; if there is to be any growth or future for a particular area and no-one is prepared to come forward, what can one do? Either one says, "We will not do anything at all", or the Board must step in, acting if necessary through an agent, and do something. This is perfectly reasonable and sensible. There was the example of the North of Norway, which has a fixed kind of ownership. They use every possible method, and they have been very successful in an even more difficult area than the one with which we are concerned.<br><br>
Therefore, if this matter comes to a Division, which I hope it will not, I shall support the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting and useful, but I thought that certain people would regard it as a clash of ideologies. It was clear that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) was much nearer that position than I Vas. Of course, we have not had a speech from the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), who left the room, I think, because he was very embarrassed by the rather sensible things which the Minister of State was saying.<br><br>
The hon. Member for the Western Isles is a little unfair when he says that private enterprise is always too slow, and I should like to take up that point together with the one which my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) made. The pulp mill which was set up was a perfect example of co-operation between the Government and private enterprise. It was set up not very long ago and I am informed that, with luck, it will be producing pulp this autumn and producing paper early next year. This is a very remarkable achievement of a highly technical and difficult nature, and those of us who live in the Highlands know that it is harder to build such a project there than in any other place. But with a Highlands contractor doing the building, and with a great deal of Highlands labour being used, we have achieved speed and efficiency. Even if they wanted to, I do not believe that the Government could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0546">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
set up and ran a pulp mill. The Government are much better consumers of paper than producers of it.<br><br>
In regard to the Forestry Commission, the Minister indicated that he is not against helping private industry if it is prepared to go forward, and this is very important in securing the co-operation of everybody in the Highlands. But if private landlords—some of them may be bad, and we may have differing views about the proportion—feel that all of the Government's effort and money are going into the Forestry Commission, that will have a very dampening down effect upon a great deal of useful work that could be done.<br><br>
The Minister said that no one in his senses would ask the Board to do things which private enterprise or landlords were prepared to go ahead and do, and this is the right attitude. I am not certain that all of his hon. Friends agree. But if this is really the way in which the present Minister of State and the Secretary of State intend to operate this Clause, then my objections to this phrase are removed. If they are not going to come in deliberately to compete, if they are not going to give assistance only to the State enterprises in the Highlands—whether it is the Forestry Commission, the Hydro-Electric Board, or anything else—but are going to give it fairly to those people who, in their view, can carry out these operations most efficiently and most economically, from the point of view of labour and of the taxpayer, then I am perfectly prepared to withdraw my Amendment. But if this is merely a way of indicating what might possibly happen and if we were to be faced with it in a few months, then we would regard it as a gross breach of faith.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I meant what I said. I am not in the habit of saying things I do not mean. I will not repeat my speech, but I certainly meant the words that I used in my first speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On those conditions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 29, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p><i>(d)</i> to undertake such specific and immediate measures to advance the economic and social development of the Highlands and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
Islands or any part thereof as the Board may deem necessary. Any such specific measures requiring an expenditure exceeding £50,000 shall be subject to approval by the Secretary of State.</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is directly related to Amendment No. 78 which we have already discussed. In a way, it is the other half of that Amendment although it stands on its own. It embodies a desirable objective to which I think a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are sympathetic. Clause 3(1,<i>b</i>) says that the Board will
<br><blockquote><p>"… prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for his approval proposals, whether general or specific in character, for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands…"</p></blockquote>
To us in the Liberal Party this seems to afford too little freedom of action to the Board. This is a problem with which we have become involved on a number of occasions. The Minister of State spoke about the teeth of the Board but, if everything is to be premsaticated in St. Andrew's House, sharp teeth for the Board will hardly be necessary. If we put everything into civil service channels we will slow things down a great deal, and that is something we should try to avoid.<br><br>
It is very important that the Board should have at least a certain area within which it can act promptly and without referring back to the Secretary of State—which, as I have said, does not necessarily mean referring back to the Secretary of State himself but putting it through the system and letting the system slowly process the proposal. For example, the Highland Fund already has this sort of freedom on a very small scale. It can assist a particular enterprise without necessarily going through the long and rather tedious process which bureaucracy necessarily breeds. The Highland Board should be considerably more than the Highland Fund writ large.<br><br>
The difficult question I found was how to draw the line. Obviously, the Secretary of State must have general supervision. How does one give the Board a certain degree of specific freedom? It is a very desirable objective but how can it be achieved? It is very difficult to find the answer. The Amendment may not necessarily be the best way of doing it, but it is the best way that I can think of to draw a financial line below which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
the Board will have freedom to take action without going through the normal channels. It is very important that the Board should have freedom of action within a certain range in order to assist, for example, a particular firm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to agree with the hon. Gentleman. Does he visualise the Board being free to allocate as grant a sum of, say, up to £50,000 of public money? Does he also visualise the Board taking a continuing interest in that enterprise which is using this public money and that the Board itself might well take shares in the enterprise?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not visualise the Board taking shares. I visualised the Board having a certain freedom within a budget of this size, which is quite a small figure. The Board should have a certain amount of money that it can allocate without referring back to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Suppose that there is a private project to which the Board agrees to advance £50,000. Is it a free gift loan or a subsidy, and will the Board and firm remain answerable for the use of that £50,000? Will the taxpayer get anything additional back out of this money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the taxpayer would certainly get his money back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then this would be in the form of loans?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be primarily loans. I was not necessarily thinking of this as a means of purchasing shares in industry. I was merely thinking that it would give a certain degree of freedom to the Board to assist industry and other enterprises without always having to refer back to the Secretary of State. When I moved Amendment No. 78 the Minister of State said that the Board should not be preoccupied with planning. That is true. I hope the Amendment makes it clear what I seek to achieve even if this is not the best form of words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is rather attractive and I do not dissent from a very great deal of what the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) has said about not wanting every proposal by the Board to have to go up to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
Secretary of State, particularly in so far as they concern proposals for industry under Clause 8 which deals with advances and loans to industry. We are concerned about that as well.<br><br>
There are certain difficulties about the Amendment as it stands because it would be possible for the Board, within the terms of the Amendment, to split up a scheme into two or three smaller schemes, allocating £50,000 to each. That, in total, would be a very substantial scheme. It would not have to be approved by the Secretary of State, however. The Secretary of State is the watchdog and it would not be in accordance with the spirit of the Bill if the Board could do this simply as a result of putting a certain number of schemes together.<br><br>
Again, the importance of schemes is not necessarily measured by financial cost. For instance, a scheme costing £20,000 might be more important in a certain area or environment than one costing £50,000 somewhere else in a different context. So that is not altogether a test. One could get very important schemes within this Amendment which could be carried out without the Secretary of State having seen them.<br><br>
What we propose to do under Clause 8, dealing with grants and loans to industry, is to empower the Board to draw up a scheme in co-operation with the Secretary of State and the Treasury which will enable it to make grants and loans up to a certain level without having to refer back. The hon. Gentleman referred to the Highland Fund and the Treasury loan scheme. With that scheme it is possible for the Highland Fund to give loans of up to £7,500 without reference back. We envisage that the Board will be in a position to give very much larger loans than that. In fact, the same arrangements will apply. A scheme will be drawn up and the amount which the Board will be able to allocate in loans will be very much higher. There is also additional power in the Bill for the Board to make grants, and we hope to cover this, too, in schemes.<br><br>
With regard to other categories of approvals, under Clause 14(1) the Secretary of State can give
<br><blockquote><p>"… approval or consent … in relation to a specific act of the Board or in relation to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
all acts of a class or description specified in the approval or consent, and may be given subject to such conditions, if any, as he thinks fit"</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Secretary of State will be able to give category approval. The Board may think it right to do certain things—for instance, to set up information kiosks for the tourist industry. The Secretary of State could give a categorical approval so that the Board would not have to come to him every time it wanted to set up an information kiosk or information centre.<br><br>
Between the arrangements proposed in Clause 8 and the power of the Secretary of State in Clause 14, it will be possible to achieve practically all that the hon. Gentleman asks for and, in view of this, I hope that he will not press his Amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain that I can agree with the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) in his suggestion that
<br><blockquote><p>"Any such specific measures requiring an expenditure exceeding £50,000 shall be subject to approval by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
and should be confined solely to the question of industrial enterprises, as he seems to suggest. That was certainly not my purpose when I made this suggestion on Second Reading. I am delighted that he took up my suggestion. It may well be that he wanted to make the same sort of speech had he had the good fortune to be called. I would like this power to be wider, and I do not think that the points made by the Minister of State meet what I hope he will be able to do perhaps when he has had further time to think about this.<br><br>
This is an attractive idea, for two reasons. First it is attractive from the point of view of the speed of getting things done. I do not want to cast any slur on my old colleagues in the Scottish Office, but things do not always pass from the bottom to the top with the speed that one would like. If every single scheme is to go through that hoop it will be slowed down. Second, and more important than the question of speed, is the question of the status and importance to which the Board will feel entitled and in which the people of the Highlands will regard the Board.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
The Minister has said that if one gives the Board a specific sum of this sort, £50,000, which it could spend without applying to the Secretary of State, then the Board might look at, say, some small industrial estate and break it up into five factories and say that it should have £50,000 on each. If one looks at it in a wider way and takes a piece of land in the Highlands and develops it in a way that so much is to be reclaimed, so much to be put to forestry, so much for some other purpose—perhaps a special sawmill or something of that sort—then in that case the sum of £50,000 would be for the development of the whole area, probably in conjunction with the landlord or owner.<br><br>
I see the difficulty of saying how much money the Board should be allowed to spend. I see the difficulty of saying that because the sum of £50,000 had been suggested, one might be able to start a comparatively unimportant scheme, whereas £60,000 or something of that sort might be infinitely better. But surely what we want to do is to give the Board some freedom of action, and by definition the Board will consist of competent, able, sensible people. Surely no Board of the type and quality we are talking about would try to get round the obvious intention and clearly expressed wish of the House by breaking up some enterprise into small lots of £50,000? The Secretary of State would soon terminate the appointment of the Board members if they did so.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will think more about this point. I am much attracted to it, though I am not attracted to it if it is only to be thought of in the industrial sense. There are many other matters on which I would want the Board to have a reasonable amount of say, such as the Forestry Commission, the Hydro-Electric Board, and so on, and on which to spend money within a reasonable limit without everything automatically having to be passed by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One would visualise that in the course of time there would be issued by the Secretary of State a number of category approvals under Clause 14 which would cover many of these matters, and which could be extended
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
after the experience of operations by the Board. We might find that they would cover a fairly large number of things in the Highlands in the course of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to speak on a slightly different and wider Amendment, but I have already discussed this point on Second Reading—namely, the desirability of a global sum being available to a Board of this kind. If there is one thing which would underwrite its status and independence it would surely be to have a global sum available to it with, naturally, proper conditions and safeguards for the taxpayer. That would be the most desirable thing of all, but I will not go into that matter now.<br><br>
On the stated sums involved, this is certainly a difficult point. Whether it is £50,000 or £30,000, there would be an acceptance of the principle that I am endorsing. This would be true, of course, when one mentions almost any sum. Until a few years ago local authorities had to get a provisional order for marine works, for example, if they went over £5,000. The limit was increased to £25,000 and so a provisional order has not since then been necessary for a sum of up to £25,000. It simplified the procedure considerably.<br><br>
I am not saying that a local authority is, even so, able to spend £25,000 without asking the Secretary of State, but in a case involving this Board this is something different, for this in many ways is a new concept. The hon. Gentleman knows that there is a great deal of sympathy throughout the Highlands in favour of the Board's having global sums and some real independence in spending up to a reasonable limit without every time having to come to the Secretary of State and to the Treasury. I am sure the hon. Gentleman has this sympathetically in mind, and I would imagine that his main difficulty would be in mentioning a figure of spending money without reference back. But even a token number of sums of a few thousand pounds would give the Board some semblance of financial autonomy.<br><br>
This is a difficult case to argue for, of course, the taxpayers' money has to be watched and safeguarded. There is the difficulty that if one goes beyond a certain sum, legislation is almost always involved. On anything like a pulp mill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
one would have to have a Bill. It is difficult to say at what stage in the financial process one would have automatically to face legislation and what figure one would set to avoid this. But for a project like a pulp mill, even a wee pulp mill, it would be necessary, at the present cost of pulp mills, to seek legislation for it, not least if it involved local authorities in public expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was rather hoping that the provisions of this Bill as drawn—the Minister may be able to answer this point—would make is unnecessary in future to have legislation for an operation like a pulp mill in the Highlands. This was something that attracted me in the Bill. There might be a battle—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That does not come within the £50,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry it does not. I did mention a "wee pulp mill", which does not sound so expensive. I am sure we can come to some sort of agreement on an independent spending figure giving some autonomy on the Board's part in allocating the money. If one looks at Clause 7—I am not going to argue its merits or demerits—one finds that the Board shall have power
<br><blockquote><p>"to provide or assist in the provision of advisory training, management, technical accountancy and other services to persons engaged in or proposing to engage in business in the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
It shall have power
<br><blockquote><p>"to promote or assist in the promotion of publicity";</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"to engage in such other activity as the Board may deem expedient for the introduction or development of industrial, commercial and other enterprises in the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
I have seen this at work. I know the kind of sums that were authorised to be spent. The Herring Industry Board has power to buy or order the construction of vessels, and it can lease a whole fishing fleet to other agencies or private individuals or firms. It also has power to spend on technical advice, in relation to anybody who asks for it, to promote sales and assist any enterprise, or to engage in publicity on its own behalf or on behalf of the industry as a whole. I remember one campaign in which over £80,000 was spent by the Herring Industry Board in publicity. It was spent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
chiefly in America to sell "Tartan" Kippers—a reference to the package and not to the contents. The Herring Industry Board has spent very large sums of money in such projects.<br><br>
If one is thinking in terms of a regional campaign to attract industry by publicising the functions and services of the Board under Clause 7, one may well at any time spend £50,000 on such a campaign. I do not see that there has to be any reference back to the Secretary of State or the Treasury under Clause 7, under which large sums could be spent. The Minister himself has assisted the argument on its way with a few words of good will in reference to Clause 8. There there are the grants to crofters in another Clause. All these things the Board might well be doing at any one time, and any category of them can amount to large sums indeed. The question is whether the Board shall be allowed, without reference back to the Secretary of State and the Treasury, to spend specified sums of money. There is an attractive argument for it. Whether or not £50,000 is the right figure I do not know; in fact, whether it is possible to state any figure again I do not know. If it can be confirmed that the Board can spend fairly freely in certain of these respects without reference back, without amending the Bill, that would be heartening information for some of us.<br><br>
I can see the need in an emergency for the Board to be able to advance money. I am not saying that the Board should have the power to give a grant of £50,000 to somebody without any regard to repayment and so on. It is desirable that some body in the Highlands and Islands should have the power and almost the duty to advance money to tide over financially reputable firms which are in difficulties, or which have not quite sufficient capital to set up a project which is likely to succeed and give employment.<br><br>
The Minister of State has before him at this at this moment an example which I have brought to his notice recently. The firm of Perrins, in Stornoway, has been giving considerable employment and has been diversifying production in textiles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing what the Board should do.

We are discussing whether the Board should have power to do something without consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that I am on, and it is related to the one example that I about to give. Some £7,000 or £8,000, for example, would be needed to tide such a firm over, to help it to continue to give employment in the area and to continue the production of textiles in the Highlands. When the firm got into difficulties I went to see my hon. Friend the Minister of State. My hon. Friend acted with the greatest promptitude and has been looking at the matter most sympathetically. He sent commissioners, if I may so call them—Mr. Grant of the Crofters Commission and Mr. Rollo of the Highland Fund—to consult about—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must confine himself to the terms of the Amendment</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a couple of sentences more may relate my remarks to your satisfaction, Mr. Steele. The purpose of those gentlemen going there was to see whether it was possible out of public funds to find enough money to assist it out of its difficulties. This is what I am hoping this Amendment would in practice achieve in a number of cases. I know the hon. Gentleman had in mind the promotion of going concerns. It also has application to firms which are temporarily in difficulty, and I should have thought this highly relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This arises on a later Clause. We are now discussing whether the Board shall have power to do something within a certain sum without consultation with the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Steele. My whole point is that the Highland Development Board, within a sum of £50,000, should be able, without reference to the Secretary of State or anybody else, to do what we were not able to do in the case of the firm of Perrins. I am showing the other, the blank side of the medal. In this case, had the Board been in existence and possessed the power given under this Amendment, it would have been able to come in and assist this firm. As it is, the Highland Fund is unwilling, and not prepared to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0551">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
commit itself to spend Highland Fund money. There has been no authorisation by the Treasury from the Fund's State-provided sources, to make the advance of money which would have kept this firm in being and enable it to survive—</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now arguing something which comes under Clause 8 entitled "Grants and loans". This particular Amendment does not deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Steele, I am dealing with the value of the independent availability to the Board of £50,000 expendable or obtainable by itself without reference to the Secretary of State, and I do not think there should be any need to quarrel with the Chair on that point. If the Board had this power it could take emergency action in such cases as I have quoted, among others, and in the promotion of enterprises which otherwise would take a very long time indeed to get under way, as a result of having to go through the whole machinery of the Scottish Office, the Treasury and all the rest of it. Therefore, I think there is a great deal to be said for a certain amount of money being expendable by the Board in the form of loans—probably of grants, also—in emergency cases and helping people to tide over difficult moments in the life of their business.<br><br>
I have used this illustration as a very obvious case of how, without having to go through the whole of the Government machinery and the Departmental machinery, it should be possible to extend assistance to firms and help to keep them in being, apart from assisting new enterprises.<br><br>
In this case I am not discussing grants and loans as State share investment because I think the party and the Government to which we belong has already taken a very clear, definite and well-known line there. I am not going to talk about the Government taking shares in a company into which they are asked to put public money. I know there is very little support on the other side of the Committee for that, anyway, but with regard to loans I should have thought the hon. Gentleman has a very strong case which would help many firms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
and new projects of all kinds in the Highlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to pursue his Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to get one or two things clear, if I may. I have no particular desire to press this matter to a Division, not because I do not think it is a good thing but I am quite prepared to admit that the wording may not be what it ought to be. Do I gather, first of all, that the Minister proposes to insert something into Clause 8 which will have some kind of similar effect? Do I gather, in fact, that he is going to amend Clause 8 in a certain way with the object of giving the Board some of the freedom of quick action and indepedence within a certain sphere which I think people want to achieve?<br><br>
Secondly, while obviously what he says about category sanctions is true and will produce an ever-expanding area of freedom, it will still take some time before results can be seen. One feels that categories themselve are always rather difficult to define, and one of the problems facing people is which category they are in and whether or not a proposal is within a specific category. While it is true that it will extend the independence of the Board in certain spheres more and more as time passes, I should like also to have this freedom particularly to initiate something new, because it would be primarily with something new that this kind of freedom would be most useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would allow me, if I speak now it may avoid having to add any further request to the Minister. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me that the wording of his Amendment rather suggests that it relates only to undertaking "specific and immediate measures"? I think he agrees that the figure of £50,000 should not be used only for industrial purposes. Does he not agree with me that it would be of advantage if this money could be used across the wider phase to assist other sorts of undertakings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the right hon. Gentleman has just said. That was, indeed, my intent, and I admit that while the wording possibly does not adequately reflect this intention, I am very anxious to get some sort of indication from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
Minister that he is considering this. I do not mind where he brings it into the Bill, so long as there is some sort of provision of this kind. I think it is important that there should be this kind of freedom, and I think the contributions from both sides of the Committee indicate that it is also the view of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I might answer the hon. Gentleman, his first point was that this proposal was desirable, and I do not dissent. When I replied to the Amendment I only mentioned some of the difficulties as we saw them. I also pointed out that we were meeting this situation to some extent, and probably to a considerable extent, under Clauses 8 and 14. If I might, without getting too much out of order, but so as to give the hon. Gentleman an idea of what I mean, I would indicate that I do not propose to move an Amendment to Clause 8.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman knows, under the Treasury loans scheme, which is at present operated by the Highland Fund, a scheme has been agreed as between the Highland Fund, the Secretary of State—I think the right hon. Gentleman would be responsible for this—and the Treasury, whereby the Highland Fund can make loans up to a certain sum without applying to anybody at all, and of course within certain totals over a period of time. That scheme did not require legislation; it was agreed, and this is what will happen under this Bill.<br><br>
In framing this Bill this matter has been and is being discussed. It is not for me, however, to say how far those discussions have gone because, this is for the Board to negotiate with the Secretary of State and the Treasury. What I can say is that the scheme which the Board will operate in connection with loans will be on a larger and wider scale and the limits will be substantially higher than the present scheme operated by the Highland Fund. So the Board will have power to make loans to industry without referring them back all the time to the Secretary of State. I think that meets the point of the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The other way in which we shall build up the power of the Board to act independently—and I fully appreciate the desire for this—is under Clause 14(1), and the building up of certain category
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
approvals. The Secretary of State might say that land acquisitions up to a certain acreage should not require to go to him. In other words, there would be no need to get approval from the Secretary of State, but the Board could proceed with them in the ordinary way. The small scheme mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman, where they were going to put up a wee pulp mill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The "wee pulp mill" was mentioned by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought the hon. Gentleman wanted a scheme of this character, which could be a category approval. I quoted another example—for instance, an information bureau for the tourist industry. It could even cover the particular commodity which has been mentioned; we could have category approvals for public conveniences, to satisfy the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Joking apart, in the course of time and from the experience of the Board when it has seen the kind of activities engaged in and has considered their desirability, cost and frequency, there will be built up a body of categories within which the Board will be able to operate freely up to certain limits. Clearly, the limit for information bureaux might be a different limit from that for land acquisition, but this body will be built up, and all the time the Highland Development Board will be getting greater and greater individual powers and freedom to act on its own, which is what we desire. This might not go far enough for the hon. Gentleman, but that is the answer to his Amendment. This is how we see it being built up and, at the same time, retaining the safeguard exercised by the Secretary of State on behalf of Parliament, which of course is customary.<br><br>
We want to give the widest degree of liberty possible to the Board and we shall do it under these two Clauses, and I think that we shall manage to give the Board a very considerable degree of liberty. I think it was the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) who said that I had never said anything about what the Board will be like. I have been trying to say that for the past four months. In fact, I have become rather sick of hearing myself talk about it at times. But it is difficult to realise what might be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0553">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
happening in two, three or four years' time, and that is why I cannot be more specific. I hope the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that explanation and will now withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to move Amendment No. 81?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Steele. Is there any intention on the part of the Minister to move a Sittings Motion today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then may I ask you, Mr. Steele, what would be the appropriate time for me to move a Sittings Motion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would have to be at the beginning of this Sitting, and the hon. Gentleman is now out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But, Mr. Steele, I was given to understand that no one needed to give notice of moving a Sittings Motion. I thought that was said at our last meeting. I am raising this matter because we seem to have got into a bit of a muddle at our Sitting on Tuesday, and I must admit that perhaps I helped towards that muddle. Seriously, is there any way out of the difficulty? On reading the report of our proceedings last Thursday—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot go back to the discussion last Thursday.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to know whether he would be in order at this moment in moving a Sittings Motion, he would be in order in doing so but it is for the Chair to decide whether it should be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then, with your permission, Mr. Steele, may I ask if the Committee would be prepared to accept—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We would have first of all to move the adjournment of the consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
All I am trying to do is to redress the situation and to suggest that we meet at Four o'clock on Tuesday—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say to the hon. Gentleman that I am not prepared to accept the Motion "That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned".<br><br>
Does the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) wish to move Amendment No. 81?</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 29, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(e) having regard to the recommendations of the Highland Transport Board and in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Minister of Transport to prepare and submit urgently a transport plan for the Highlands and Islands.</p></blockquote>
A number of us have said on several occasions that the word "transport" appears at no stage in the Bill. Unless provisions are made for transport and unless a real concerted effort is made to improve the efficiency of the transport communication system in the Highlands, this Board will not succeed.<br><br>
It could be argued, I imagine, by the Minister that, for example, under Clause 7<i>(c)</i> he might well be able to take such action in regard to transport as is necessary. Clause 7<i>(c)</i> says:
<br><blockquote><p>"to engage in such other activity as the Board may deem expedient for the introduction or development of industrial, commercial and other enterprises in the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
That might well cover the subsidisation of transport. I do not know; it might. However, it would seem to me that if this Board is going to have the breadth of purpose and intent which so many of us hope it will, it must act in the transport field. I suggest that this will mean that it must be able to engage certainly in co-operation with the Minister of Transport, for example, in the subsidisation of specific railway lines if this is regarded as being necessary. Obviously in certain cases it would be more desirable to subsidise a railway line than immediately to embark on the construction of a highly expensive road alternative. This is extremely important.<br><br>
Equally, I would have thought that it is an inevitable part of the logic of setting up a Board of this kind that we are embarking on an essay in regional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0554">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
development. In other words, we are saying that we want to increase the population of the Highland areas; we want to redress the balance of population in Scotland. The only way in which this will effectively be done, I think, is through the introduction of regional variations in transport costs.<br><br>
The only argument I can see against the insertion of any provision such as is suggested in this Amendment is that it is unnecessary. I would hope that when the Minister replies he will not say that he opposes it because the Board will not be involved in transport, because I think the Board has got to be involved in transport. People in the Highlands would be very disappointed if it were not involved in transport, and involved very closely. This is extremely important and must be emphasised.<br><br>
Judging from the admittedly short experience that I have had in this Committee, and from what hon. Members have said on both sides of the Committee, it appears to be absolutely essential that if we want a specific thing to be done, then we must write it clearly and specifically into the Bill, or the legal profession will say, "Look, my friend, it is not there, so we do not have to do it".<br><br>
We already know that the Highland Transport Board is in the process of preparing an overall survey of transport in the Highlands, after which I understand it is to go out of existence. It is rather like the bee which, once it stings, will die. Who is going to take over? This is not a once-for-all business. It is not a question purely of saying, "This is the framework that we want to see in Highland transport. This is our report. Here you are. You take it over". Somebody has got to take it over. Who is going to take it over?—presumably the Highlands and Islands Development Board. They are going to take over responsibility for this field, presumably. If this is the case, I would say that there is nothing wrong—in fact, there is everything right—in writing it into the Bill.<br><br>
It seems to me that I have made my points clearly enough without necessarily going into the many examples which one could very easily adduce of the drawbacks to development, the hampering of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
development which transport costs occasion. It would be very easy to give a long list of examples, and I have no doubt that the Minister himself could contribute just as fully to that. I do not think there is any point in going into this.<br><br>
The simple point I make is that the Board must be involved in transport. If it means business in the Highland area, I would say it will inevitably be involved in subsidisation and, for example, in assisting the construction of particular roads, whether they be for social, economic or tourist purposes. Secondly, the Board will, I would have thought, fall heir to the dying Transport Board and consequently will have a function to fulfil there.<br><br>
For these reasons, I think it is extremely important that we get this word "transport" firmly into the Bill, and the intention of the Board to deal with it firmly and clearly declared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we accept what the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) says, that we must extend the power to cover transport right through, even to subsidising the railway lines, and so on, which may be necessary, then, following the same logic, we could extend this to every section of the community and to every Department of the Government. In fact, all that is required here is simply to point out that we already have the power under Clause 3(1,<i>a</i>) to
<br><blockquote><p>"review all matters relating to the economic … development of the Highlands."</p></blockquote>
If we start trying to put down in detail all the things for which the hon. Member is asking, then we want the power of a dictator. That is what he is seeking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I deny this; this is not true at all. The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) says that I am seeking the powers of a dictator for the Board. This is not so at all. However, I do want something as important as transport to be clearly shown as being not only one of its powers but one of its obligations. It is not enough to say that it widely has the power; it must also have an obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But surely the fact that the Board has the obligation to keep under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0555">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
review all matters relating to the development of the Highlands must undoubtedly include transport. However, if we start to specify what all these things are, then I maintain that we will end up by specifying every section or business of the community or every department of the Government and its functions. This is what this reasoning leads to. The hon. Gentleman goes on to say that lawyers will say that there is no power in the Bill in relation to recommendations on transport. I would say to him that lawyers, having seen the Bill, could read or write anything under the terms already set out in the Bill. They could write the word "transport" without any difficulty at all into paragraph <i>(a).</i> No lawyer would have the slightest difficulty in saying that transport is obviously included as one of the items necessary for development of an industry in the Highlands.<br><br>
I think this Amendment is totally unnecessary and will cause a great deal of trouble, extending to all sorts of things, for which there is no need, as they are all covered by these words already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder, Mr. Steele, if you would be prepared to accept a Motion to adjourn the debate in order that a Sittings Motion could be moved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I could not accept such a Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a word in support of the Amendment before we finish. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) to some extent agrees about the value of the Amendment even if he felt it was not necessary in its entirety. Because transport is embraced, on his own argument, by the words in the Bill, I would suggest that the Amendment might be perfectly reasonable in that it asks, within its job of attending to transport questions, that it should be in on the job of preparing a transport plan. I do not think there is anything objectionable in that. I do not subscribe to his view that by keeping a short line going we are going to run in competition with British Railways. I do not think that has ever been intended.<br><br>
It is not suggested by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) that somebody ought to take over British Railways. This is not the point of this Amendment. There are cases—and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
hon. Member gave one example—where it might be that the Board would be able to give first-rate advice and the best advice on whether, in fact, it would be better to find some money to keep a small spur railway line going than to construct new miles of extremely expensive road. Road construction is expensive. There is no doubt that if one studies the economics of constructing a road over some of the areas where it was proposed not long ago to withdraw the railway services, the cost would run into many millions of pounds.<br><br>
That situation may well arise at any time, and it might confront the Board. Therefore, it is far better that the Board should be in at the beginning in the preparation of a plan. After all, the Amendment states, as regards the recommendation from the Highland Transport Board, that anything the Board itself will do will be in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Minister of Transport and, I assume, the local authorities and other corporate bodies, to whom we referred earlier today. It would be extraordinary if the Board were left out of the making of the plan. It cannot be in the mind of my hon. Friend that the Highland Development Board should not be taking part in the preparation of transport plans for the Highlands and Islands area.<br><br>
If I remember rightly, it was written very firmly into the Labour Party's own policy that each of the regional boards should, in fact, undertake a complete survey of the transport needs of their area and prepare integrated transport schemes. I do not imagine for one minute that it was intended that the Highlands and Islands Development Board should have been excluded from that intention and that programme. Therefore, it would still remain a priority duty as well as a power of the Highlands Development Board, as one of these regional boards, to assist, as it says in the party policy documents, in the preparation of an integrated transport programme for its area. That is perfectly clear and, as the Minister says, we are concerned with keeping Election promises and fulfilling our part of the programme.<br><br>
It will, in fact, almost automatically be a duty of the Development Board to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0556">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
prepare a plan for an integrated transport system, suitable to its own area within national transport planning. I know that on the Election platform I am committed to that. I am committed to it because it was an essential part of Labour Party policy and, therefore, of Government policy as well.<br><br>
We have still to act, for example, upon the Jack Report and the Kilbrandon Report on rural buses. Two Ministers of Transport have been sitting on these two eggs. So far we have still only taken samples from different areas—none of them, I may say, in the Highlands and Islands. Therefore, planning rural bus services is a job which still has to be done, and done by the most suitable body. Presumably, it will now be done in the Highland and Island area after the Highland Transport Board has passed out of existence, by the next body in line with responsibility, which is the Highland Development Authority.<br><br>
Transport is an inescapable problem in the Highlands. Road, rail, sea and air transport are all at different stages of development and all working at varying levels of efficiency and inefficiency. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
have British Railways running one part of transport in the area. We have MacBraynes operating a considerable part of the sea and bus routes with an involvement of public money aid, at the moment, of something like £500,000 a year. Yet it is under the control operationally almost completely of private directors, answerable to private shareholders, except that on the financial side there is a Government observer watching the interests of the Government's involvement.<br><br>
Obviously, getting transport right for economic and other development is going to form a very large part of the work of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. I feel that this should be given emphasis, and that there is no reason in this case why the Board should not be given the duty and authority to take part in the preparation of an integrated transport plan in the Highlands, which is what we had in mind.</span></p>
