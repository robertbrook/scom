<p><i>Further Amendment proposed [18th May],</i> In page 11, line 6, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"2. The chairman and the deputy chairman and not fewer than four other members of the Board shall be full-time members."—[<i>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure at what stage I was when the Committee closed yesterday, and copies of HANSARD are, unfortunately, not available, but as I recollect I was saying I felt that one of the reasons why it seemed to me that the Government were thinking in terms of part-time members for at least a proportion of the membership of the Board was that the scale of operation of the Board would appear rather more restricted than was generally expected and certainly widely hoped for before the Election. It would seem to me that the fact that there has been as yet no specific assurance about the full-time character of the Board membership reflects this.<br><br>
However, despite what I regard as being the unfortunate financial omens in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum I particularly want to press this Amendment because the Minister himself, when pressed on the subject of the Memorandum, said the figure there mentioned was of no great importance and there was always the possibility of its being considerably increased; there was no special significance attached to it. Therefore, I would press this question of full-time membership and would give four main reasons why, in my opinion, it is very important that the members of the Board be full time.<br><br>
First, I think that this is a job for committed professionals and I would em-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 814</span>
phasise both words—committal and professional. It is vital that whoever is chosen to serve on the Board—and I sympathise with the Minister in the task he has in choosing the members—should be committed absolutely to success; and a part-time Board never is. A part-time member can always return to something else. It has to be remembered that his reputation has been established in some other field and the very reason he is chosen is because he has a reputation elsewhere. Therefore, his reputation is unlikely to be gravely diminished if his work in this particular field is not outstandingly successful. Professionalism will demand the full-time attention of very skilful people.<br><br>
Secondary, it is very much a job for the skilful. One can imagine that a great deal of the work of the members of the Board will consist in persuading other experts, whether they be civil servants in St. Andrew's House or full time people in the Forestry Commission, the Crofters Commission, the Hydro-Electric Board, the White Fish Authority, or anything else like that, of the value of a particular kind of case. This requires full time and skilful attention and it is inevitably a job for decisive people. There will be a great deal of quick decision making and long and detailed negotiation and this again, in itself, is not a job which should be given to anyone but to some person who can give it his full time attention. We should be foolish to ignore example but the only real example of this kind of regional authority which we have is the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. Here, three full time people were told to get on with the job, and it has been immensely successful.<br><br>
I said that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if, with this Amendment, we briefly discussed Amendment No. 48 which is concerned with the salary of the chairman; and this is really part of the same argument. It is not a separate argument at all and it would be natural to discuss the two things together. I mention the salary as being not less than £10,000 a year. On the basis of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, which tells us that in the first year Exchequer expenditure of the order of £150,000 might be anticipated, that would mean that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0775">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 815</span>
chairman would be earning 6 or 7 per cent. of the total Exchequer grant on the Board. I see that the hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Is not my arithmetic correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He would not be employed for the first year because the first year is from last April to next April.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In any case, it would not be an inconsiderable percentage of the total expenditure and therefore it is quite clear that this Amendment was put down while thinking in terms of money available of a rather different order.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I still think that the point I seek to make stands. The chairman of this Board must by virtue of his position and salary enjoy a very considerable status. In these days one does not get people of real ability to undertake a job of this kind which, after all, is a pretty risky job with no certainty of success or glory or any likelihood that a man will make his reputation in it, unless there is adequate reward. If we are to take someone from industry or the higher administrative ranks, then to get a person of real calibre and quality we would have to offer a salary of something of the order I have suggested. I think that that needs no further underlining or elaboration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment, and the others with which we are concerned, deal with three points. First, the degree of full-time membership of the Board; secondly, the period for which the members shall be appointed, and thirdly, the salary of the Chairman.<br><br>
May I start my remarks once again by saying something about the figure of £150,000 mentioned in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum? What I think the hon. Member who has just spoken has ignored is the fact, as I pointed out to him just now, that the first financial year will not be a full year. It is difficult to see the Board being set up before August or September at the earliest and it will then have to recruit staff and get down to its work. So it is not expected that the expenditure would be very large in this period.<br><br>
Secondly, it is natural that the salaries would form a large part of the initial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 816</span>
expenditure because, during the first year, a great deal of work will not have been undertaken and that is the basis on which the £150,000 figure has to be looked at. The really effective period of the Board will be a small part of the financial year and that is why we have put in £150,000.<br><br>
So far as the full-time membership is concerned, let me say first—and I have given my views on full-time membership at some length during earlier proceedings on the Bill and will not repeat all the quotations from my own speeches—that quite clearly the Government have in mind a mainly full-time Board. There is no dubiety about that as hon. Members will see if they care to look at my earlier remarks.<br><br>
This brings me to the first point raised by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). He says there must be committed professionals but what does that mean? To me it must mean that the person has to be appointed for life and to the extent to which it does not mean that, well then, when we talk of a mainly full-time Board we are surely talking of committed professionals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dr. Beeching was not appointed for life, but he was committed during the time he held his office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That argument applies to all full-time members we shall appoint. We shall have a Board mainly of "committed professionals". That is what we want.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman says they must be skilful people, but I am not so certain about the word "skilful". What is it supposed to define? Of course, the Board can employ its own skilled people if the word is used as it is generally understood for professionals. The Board will employ its own experts, its own skilful people, because the Board will require all the qualities such as the hon. Gentleman has mentioned this morning—power of decision, and that sort of thing. To that extent, of course, I do not argue with the hon. Gentleman, but it seems to me that we shall meet that requirement. We have very much in mind the necessity for this. If we did not have it in mind it would be a very easy job to get five, six or seven people. It is precisely because we want that type of person that the job becomes rather more difficult.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0776">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 817</span>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then went on to say that they must be decisive people and I do not disagree with that. He also made an interesting point when he said that the Tennessee Valley Authority has three full-timers. Of course we cannot possibly have fewer than that on this Board, but at least we have the advantage of having more. Therefore, I do not think that the point was valid. Some of the arguments of the hon. Gentleman disappear when we think of a Board of five, six or seven. I want this to be mainly a full time Board, but having said that we must give the Minister in charge elbow room to appoint certain part-time people if he feels they could do a good job of work for the Board. I can think of people who might not be prepared to give up all they are doing, but might be prepared to give up three days a week to a job like this. The question arises: Are we going to deny ourselves the chance to employ people of that character? I should have thought not.<br><br>
In the case of no other board is a Minister tied as hon. Members are trying to tie the Secretary of State by all these Amendments. There is usually discretion left to a Minister to exercise the powers of appointment in accordance with the circumstances as he finds them, and also in accordance with the material available. For this reason we must allow the Minister a certain degree of flexibility with regard to these appointments.<br><br>
I have never quarrelled with the arguments of the hon. Members who have put their names to these Amendments. I recognise the force and strength of them and I should be the last to deny their validity. I have fought for this Board for a great many years, and having been at the centre I should be the last to deny a great many of the arguments which have been made concerning it, but we must give the Minister a certain amount of elbow room.<br><br>
I have put down Amendment No. 120 in which I have tried to meet the wishes of the Committee, without binding the Secretary of State as to the manner in which we shall appoint Members of this Board, and I hope that the Committee will accept it. I do not quarrel with the motives of those who have moved these Amendments, but I wish to stress the administrative difficulties which might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 818</span>
arise if the Minister were to be tied in the manner suggested. My Amendment is a genuine endeavour to meet the requests of hon. Gentlemen, particularly the request that the chairman must be full time. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) made quite a point of this, and was supported by others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend go a little further and say that he would consider, perhaps on Report, introducing an Amendment to the effect that the chairman shall specifically be full-time and a majority of the other members, which—assuming that there were a total of seven on the Board, including the chairman—would mean that at least five of them would be full-time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My mind is never closed on any subject and I am always prepared to look at anything. I am quite prepared to look at this again, but we have given this matter a very great deal of thought and I have been anxious to meet the wishes of the Committee as much as possible. I am prepared to look at it again, but not with any great hope that we would change it. I do not think that a Minister is tied in respect of any other board as much as this proposed Amendment would tie the Secretary of State, but we have endeavoured to meet the very genuine criticisms and expressions of opinion which have been made concerning this Highland Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just remind the hon. Gentleman that the proposal which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) put forward has virtually been embodied in the Law Commissions Bill, because as the hon. Gentleman is well aware, there is statutory provision there that the Chairman of the Law Commission in Scotland will be a permanent full-time member and the rest of the Commission will be part-time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have said that the chairman shall be full-time but in the Law Commissions Bill the other members are part-time. There is no majority of the others who are full-time members. In no other case is the Minister being bound to the extent which we are binding the Minister by our Amendment, which indicates the extent to which we have endeavoured to meet the very genuine wishes of the Committee in this respect.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0777">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 819</span>
With regard to Amendment No. 84, this would secure that on first appointment each member of the Board would be appointed for a fixed term of office. That term would not exceed five years, after which the appointment might be renewed at the discretion of the Secretary of State. It is normal practice for appointments to statutory bodies to be subject to a fixed term of office, and for such appointments to be renewable at the discretion of the appropriate Minister. Very rarely do such periods of appointment, initially or otherwise, exceed five years; they run from three to five years. But we feel that there is a possibility that the inclusion in the Bill of a five-year maximum for the period of first appointment might prevent the appointment of someone who was desperately wanted, who might not be prepared to come for four or five years and might want a guarantee of six or seven years. We might be prevented from appointing such a person if this restriction upon the freedom of the Secretary of State were to be incorporated in the Bill.<br><br>
So far as I know there is no statutory precedent at all for specifying the initial or subsequent period of appointment of members. The customary wording in most Bills is that every member of the Board shall hold and vacate office in accordance with the terms of the instrument under which he is appointed, and this is what we have suggested. There is also, of course, the point that we want a certain flexibility to stagger the appointments so that we do not have them all expiring at the same time. Once again, we would be placing restrictions upon the Secretary of State which have never been placed upon any other Minister, and it does not seem to us that there is any justification for this restriction in the case of this Board. In fact, the arguments are rather against any restriction of that kind being put into the Bill.<br><br>
The last Amendment concerns the remuneration payable to the Chairman, and once again it is quite unprecedented to put this into a Bill. I understand that the purpose of the hon. Gentleman is that he wants the job to be attractive to men of outstanding calibre who have made their mark professionally, and we accept that, but we feel that we should not tie down the Secretary of State and we should give
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 820</span>
him some discretion. We want to get the best man possible for the Board, and the salary that will be payable will probably become clear when a person has been found and preliminary soundings have been taken to see whether he will take the job, and what he himself has in mind. All this seems to be a matter which ought to be left with the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The general practice of the House has been to give Ministers powers as they are in the Schedule, and unless there were outstanding reasons why we should depart from that practice we would be wise to stick to that as much as possible. In one respect we are doing something which has not been done before, and that is specifying that the chairman shall be full-time and that the majority of other members shall be full-time. In fact, we are taking one step towards tying the Minister much more closely than he is tied in connection with other boards, and that has been done in order to meet the wishes of this Committee. It has been done as an expression of our desire to see that the Board is full-time and to meet the wishes of this Committee. In view of the fact that we have done this, I hope that hon. Gentlemen will not press these Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening with interest to this debate, and the Minister has come some way to meet the feelings which were expressed on both sides of the Committee that the Board should be, if not wholly, at least mainly full-time. I am bound to admit that I do not particularly like the wording of his Amendment. It seems to me to be rather a complicated way of putting it. I should have thought that if the Amendment had read
<br><blockquote><p>"The chairman and the majority of the members shall be engaged whole-time"</p></blockquote>
it would have been rather simpler, in the way that he always likes these things to be simple.<br><br>
I do not know what the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) feels about this. I agree with him that I should like to see the deputy chairman included. I think that his Amendment is better than that of the Minister in that respect, and if he felt that he wanted to press his Amendment I should feel that I had to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0778">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 821</span>
support it, because it is the best Amendment on the Paper. We do not want a part-time deputy chairman. That would be a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point about the deputy chairman is that it is not made obligatory upon the Secretary of State to appoint a deputy chairman. That is why nothing was said about this, but I do not disagree with what has been said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember that I and my hon. Friends wanted this deputy chairman to be appointed by the Board. Whether or not a deputy chairman is mentioned in the Bill, it is absolutely certain that in a Board of this sort someone will have to be nominated to take the chair in the event of the chairman being absent.<br><br>
All the arguments which need to be made have already been made, and I hope that the Minister is really prepared in this exceptional case to bind the Secretary of State and his successors rather more than has happened in other cases. Unless there are people giving their whole time to it, at least for the first five or ten years, the Highlands will feel that they are not getting the support which they would like.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much hope that the Minister of State will hold to his intention of not writing into the Bill any question of salaries. He is quite right here, and he certainly has my support on this point.<br><br>
The figure of £10,000 seems very high, and much more than the Chairman of the Hydro-Board receives—[H O N. MEMBERS: "Part-time."]—and we hope we can get a chairman for some figure less than this. We ought not to pay—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman of the Hydro-Board is part-time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I realise that, but his salary is very much lower, and I hope that the Minister will think of the taxpayer in matters of this kind and not waste money as the Liberal Party seems prepared to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend both for his speech and for his suggestions under his Amendment. I am not sure that his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 822</span>
Amendment goes so far as at first sight it appears to do. There is no suggestion in the Bill of the chairman being a full-time member of the Board. Even now we do not know what the number of members on the Board is going to be. All that one knows is that it will consist of a full-time chairman, and then the Minister goes on to say
<br><blockquote><p>"The majority of the members of the Board, including in particular the chairman thereof, shall be engaged whole-time. …"</p></blockquote>
We do not know, nor do we have any means of knowing, how many members are in fact going to be full-time, nor do we know how many members will compose the Board. All we know from the Bill is set out in Clause 1:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall be appointed by the Secretary of State and shall consist of a chairman and not more than six other members. …"</p></blockquote>
"Not more than six" is very roomy arithmetic. There is still no indication of the likely size of the Board or of the Minister's own optimum size. We know the maximum, but we do not know the Minister's ideal, optimum figure. Apparently no clear indication has yet been arrived at.<br><br>
There could be a chairman plus two members, that is to say a Board of three. There would then be a majority of two. If that were the case, we would not be so very far ahead. That majority would include the chairman. I do not consider that that is a satisfactory compromise, and the Minister should give a little more consideration to the numbers which would make a decent basis of full-time membership in order to enable the Board to do its work. The Minister has argued that it should have elbow room. We are arguing that there should be plenty of elbow grease. We want to see as much full-time activity by the Board as possible. If the Minister is prepared to give us a more definite picture of the numbers on the Board as well as in regard to the concession in his Amendment, it would be worth while our considering withdrawing the Amendment for the time being. At the moment he has not gone very far to meet us.<br><br>
Most of us have in our minds the picture of the Board as a high-powered body with not too many people on it, but with not too few. The tasks could be overwhelming with too small a number of people. We visualise the Board having
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0779">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 823</span>
considerable authority to undertake the great full-time task which it will bear in a large and difficult area, a task involving diverse problems. We expect it to take industrial initiative and to give encouragement. I hope that the Board will not for one moment depart from that minimal expectation. If the Board is to be expected to do these things, it must have on it enough full-time people who will give full-time attention to the various complex problems which will face them.<br><br>
At this stage the Board could still consist of as few as three members. That is not satisfactory, but it could happen. If it is possible for that to happen—and I know that that is not the Minister's intention, but it could happen—the more part-time members on the Board the more likely it is that an inadequate number of members will serve upon it.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister in calling for a certain amount of flexibility. One may have the exceptional person who is available only for part-time service on the Board. I made the case yesterday that there is some argument for flexibility. It may well be that as it gains experience the Board's task and order of priorities may change over the years. There is a case for varying the membership in regard to the bringing in of special skills.<br><br>
I found it disconcerting to be told by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) that I was not asking for enough, since I am asking for more than he is. Since we are all in such arithmetical doubt, the Minister should give us a firm undertaking that he will consider these Amendments, especially in relation to setting a reasonable minimum, and to write something into the Bill. I do not care twopence about precedents. Why should the Minister worry so much about precedents? We are not trying to tie him down, but want to ensure that the Board will be able to do its work and will have the right people and the right number of right people there to do it. The Minister will not be restricted or tied but will have full scope.<br><br>
The least we can ask for is that the chairman and his deputy should be full-time. I cannot imagine anything worse than when the Board is sitting

to have one of the part-time members slipping in as deputy chairman. The chairman is usually the person who reads all the papers—in fact, it is likely that the only other people who read all the papers are acting full-time. Part-time members as a rule are not as important or as committed as full-time members. Therefore, I suggest that the deputy should at all times be a full-time member. If there were a chairman and deputy chairman as full-time members and the majority within the seven were full-time, most of us would be satisfied.<br><br>
I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). We could possibly arrive at a compromise about the deputy chairman, chairman and four others full-time, and one part-time member. I hope that the Minister will say that he is prepared to arrive at a decision somewhere between the minimum concessions he has made and the suggestions which we have put forward in our Amendment. At the moment I am not happy, though I agree that I should like to see the Minister having enough discretion to bring in the exceptional person who is available only part-time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far as I have followed my hon. Friend the Minister of State it appears to me that he has not definitely promised to consider again this matter on Report. If he would make himself perfectly clear on that point some progress would be possible at this moment. I hope he will do so.<br><br>
I do not want to repeat arguments which have already been made, but one point which came up was the plea that we should not tie the hands of the Minister. I do not want to tie the Minister in any way at all, but under the Bill the Secretary of State will possess great powers. The Bill itself is comprehensive and will affect every single phase of fife in the Scottish Highlands. It covers a very wide compass of events indeed.<br><br>
At the back of all this is the status of Parliament itself. It has often been said that the Secretary of State is subject to the Will of Parliament, but when we are talking about not tying the Minister we must realise that the Minister in relation to Parliament is now in a somewhat different position from that of former
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0780">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 825</span>
years. We do not have the same contact with Ministers. To take the Secretary of State for Scotland as an example, since the commencement of this Parliament his appearances at the Box have been confined to three occasions. The next occasion will be on 26th May. These are the times in Parliament when Members can raise with the Secretary of State issues pertinent to the operation of this Bill. This is now limited. Of course, I know that other methods can be employed, but I am referring to the public performances. Therefore, as that sort of approach is limited, it becomes a major factor in the argument about not tying the Minister. I do not want to tie the Minister, but I submit that in deciding upon the powers of the Board, their numbers and these other important matters, our approach as members of Parliament should be to see that our control over the operations of the Board through the Secretary of State should not become too restricted. That point should be kept in mind when we are considering the Board's composition.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
If my hon. Friend's Amendment were to be accepted it would be possible to have four permanent members on the Board and three part-time members out of a total of seven. I am assuming that the potential of six others will become the actual, but we have no assurance that that will be the case. Assuming the potential becomes the actual, we shall have seven members and under my hon. Friend's Amendment three of these will be part-time. In view of what I have said about Parliamentary control and the type of job which has to be done under the Bill in the Highlands, three part-time members is a proportion which I personally would find it difficult to accept if it were put forward.<br><br>
I hope my hon. Friend will take this matter back. He can well bring it up on Report. There is a good deal to be thought about. It is clear that Members have much to say about it. He has heard the expressions of opinion this morning, and in view of this I hope he will seriously reconsider the matter on Report, and tell us that that is his intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I can make an impartial plea to the Minister of State as almost certainly I am not going to get
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
what I want anyway. I want full-time membership. I am not going to get that. I want a small Board. In spite of everything the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has said I am not going to get that either.<br><br>
In these circumstances much will depend on what the size of the Board is going to be. Let us imagine it is seven. In those circumstances I would prefer the Amendment of the hon. Member for the Western Isles. Equally the point taken up by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) concerning the deputy-chairman, which the hon. Member for Western Isles, mentioned is a fair one and ought to be considered by the Minister. I think personally that in my case it is a sign of casting an alternative vote. I would urge the Minister to take it back, look at it again, and particularly look at it in terms of what particular size he proposes the Board to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the further discussion about this. The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) is the one person who looks like getting what he wants. He wants a small Board of full-time people and he mentioned three. It looks as though he is going to get that, with the addition of certain other members who might be full-time or part-time. So he looks to be getting what he wants with certain additions. He is the only hon. Member in that position—rather the reverse to what he thought.<br><br>
We all want a sufficient number of full-time people to do this job. I am not quarrelling with that, and I have accepted most of the arguments put forward. We are discussing how best we can achieve that. I said that we have given a great deal of thought to this. We have considered all kinds of combinations, all kinds of size of Board, all kinds of combination of full-time and part-time.<br><br>
We have not really reached any conclusions about this, and this is why I would not like to give figures about what we have in mind. It would be misleading. During our discussions and thinking about this we thought that the Amendment which I have put down was a recognition of the points of view which have been expressed in this Committee. We appreciated that it did not go as far as some hon. Members would like, but we thought it was a genuine attempt to meet the views
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0781">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
of this Committee, at the same time still leaving that flexibility to the Minister in the matter of appointments to achieve the best results possible.<br><br>
I have been asked if we will look at this again. I said I was prepared to look at it again and I do not withdraw from that. What I did hesitate to say was that we would change it as a result of looking at it again. I am prepared to consider this, along with my colleagues, again, in the light of all the arguments advanced this morning. I can give that specific guarantee that we will do this, but I give no guarantee that we will necessarily change it as a result of it because, having looked at it again, we might well come to the same conclusion as we reached before. That is obvious. On the other hand, if we came to a different conclusion we would of course put down the necessary Amendment. I am prepared too look at it again, as I have said, on that understanding. Meanwhile, I hope that the Committee will at least accept the Amendment we have put down, and not press the others, as a genuine attempt to meet the points of view which have been expressed. At least we shall have got somewhere as a result of the previous discussion. I hope the Committee may, therefore, be prepared to accept my Amendment and not to press the others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has suggested that the Committee should accept his Amendment. He himself, in the course of his advice, said that he was not going to be committed in his promise to consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am committed to consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not asking him to be committed. I want him to note that he, while refusing himself to be committed, is seeking to commit us to his Amendment despite the fact that we have asked him to reconsider the matter. I thought we would, as it were, pursue our journey anew when we are on Report without either the Minister or the other hon. Members who have their names to Amendments being committed one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the only person I can commit is myself. I am not responsible for what other Members may decide to do.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
I was asked if I would look at this again. I said that certainly I would be prepared to do so in the light of this morning's discussion. I pointed out, however, that we had given this a lot of thought. I am not just saying this for the fun of the thing. We have in actual fact spent a lot of time considering this. We have thought of all sorts of combinations of members on this Board and varying sizes for the Board of five, six or seven, with a certain number of part-time and full-time members, and what the possibilities of each are. It is in the light of this consideration that we have put down the Amendment which stands in my name.<br><br>
What I have said is that I think the Amendment I have put down does represent an advance. It is a genuine attempt to meet the wishes of the Committee as expressed previously. I recognise it does not go all the way. I think it goes part of the way to meet the criticisms, about which I do not object at all, which were made of the Bill as it stood previously. What I have said now is that because it represents a step in advance I hope the Committee will be prepared to accept it. At the same time I said I would look at this again. I give a specific pledge that I will look at this again in the light of the arguments put forward this morning and in the light of any other views which come to us before Report.<br><br>
I cannot give an undertaking that I will necessarily alter it. We might come to the same conclusion as we came to before this Amendment was put down. Clearly, one can look over one's ideas and in the end come to the same conclusion. On the other hand, if we reach a different conclusion I would of course put down something else. I will certainly give a specific undertaking to look at it in the light of the discussion this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is asking us to withdraw our Amendments. I think we are entitled to ask him to withdraw his. There are Amendments in his name and ours. We are conceding, but he is not conceding anything, apart from looking at it again. It would shorten our discussions if he would give an undertaking not to press his Amendment, and we will give an undertaking not to press ours, on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0782">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 829</span>
understanding that the whole thing will be brought up again on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would add a rider to my hon. Friend's remarks, that when the Minister comes to a conclusion he should not produce an Amendment which offers anything less than his now on the Notice Paper. If he arrives at a worse conclusion I shall be dismayed, and I think he will be, too, by the reaction of a good many of us. I think his Amendment does make a considerable advance on the original provisions or lack of provisions in the Bill.<br><br>
With regard to a full-time chairman, I am grateful for that, but I am still worried about the prospect of there being a Board with a chairman and not more than seven members, but which could still number three and be equal to its own quorum. That would be an absurd situation, but as things stand it could still happen. I hope the Minister will say that in practice this Board will be fully manned and cannot become a board equal to its own quorum, including the chairman. I do not want to see that absurd situation arise.<br><br>
I do not want to see three or four people just sitting around full time. I hope hon. Members will agree that the Minister has gone part of the way. As far as I am concerned, I shall be prepared to withdraw my Amendment on the strict understanding that the Minister will not give us anything less than my own Amendment and will give a further assurance that when he does come to his conclusions, the Board will be fully manned and be a little more than the quorum of three, which is all that is essential for the Board to sit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see the relevance and the force of the point about a Board of only three, and this is one of the things I will look at.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) and the hon. Member for Fyfe, West (Mr. William Hamilton) have said. If the Minister of State is to be consistent and genuinely going to consider the Amendments put forward then the correct procedure would be to leave the Bill as it stands and bring forward a better Amendment at a later stage when the thing has been fully considered, rather than this hotchpot Amendment put in at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
the present stage. That would be a better approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) indicated that he is withdrawing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has not yet withdrawn his Amendment. Does the hon. Member wish to proceed with it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a situation of some slight complication. The Minister has made some progress with a little bit of pressure behind him, and I welcome it. The Minister has been asked to give a guarantee that nothing less than his Amendment will be reproduced, if that is the word, on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee accepts my Amendment it has already got the guarantee that nothing less than this will be put in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We want something more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee accepts the Amendment, it does not wish to be committed to not asking more more. It does not want the Minister to regard this as being the final consideration of it. We do not want to feel that he and we are all committed in advance to this on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</span></p>
<p>11.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, and with that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendment made:</i> In page 11, line 8, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>3. The majority of the members of the Board, including in particular the chairman thereof, shall be engaged whole-time in the service of the Board.—[<i>Mr. Willis.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 116 is not selected. Mr. MacMillan, to move Amendment No. 117.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Do I take it that Amendment No. 116 is not selected because "he" includes "she"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite correct. "He" embraces "she".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 831</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order. I think I am right in saying that this is only in a statutory sense and in reference to the Interpretation Act, 1889.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 11, line 28, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"and in the event of such removal shall appoint another person in his place within a period not longer than two consecutive months thereafter".</p></blockquote>
This is simply an expression of our anxiety that there should not be unreasonable delay in topping up the membership of the Board. I think that the Secretary of State has some responsibility to fill any vacancy on the Board which will be created by his own action and I think, too, that he should be under some limitation of time. The matter of keeping the Board fully manned has occupied a good part of the discussion on a large number of Amendments earlier on. There is no complication here; it is simply a matter of replacing somebody as quickly as possible in order to keep the Board full manned. The Secretary of State himself in the first place should have some responsibility placed on him to fill as soon as possible the vacancy created by himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the point which my hon. Friend has now made, but, once again, this is placing yet another restriction upon the Secretary of State in this Bill which does not apply to other Ministers in respect of boards of this kind. I will give one or two of the reasons.<br><br>
It may well be that if, for instance, we started with a Board of seven and a vacancy occurred the Secretary of State might feel, in the circumstances prevailing then—and this might be in three or four years' time—that he did not want to appoint a member to fill the vacancy and that a Board with six members might be quite adequate for the job on hand. On the other hand, he might feel that if he could keep the vacancy open for three or four months he could get a particular person to fill it, and this might be a desirable thing to do. It might be that the person he had in mind for the appointment to the Board could not clear himself of his existing commitments within a period of less than three months, and the Secretary of State might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 832</span>
quite well be prepared to wait three months, feeling that the Board would not suffer as a result.<br><br>
Those are two examples of how in fact it would operate to the disadvantage of getting the best Board possible. Once again, it is a question of the extent to which the Secretary of State is to be entrusted with the responsibility of doing his best to get the best possible Board. We feel that it would be detracting from his discretion if we accepted this Amendment, and I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will not press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am really quite delighted that my hon. Friend finally finds the ideal number for the Board to be seven. In fact, his argument seemed to dismiss every other possibility so that we are faced with a Board of seven people—with, I am confident, a full-time chairman, full-time deputy and at least four other full-time members. This has been my advocacy. I hope this is firmly rooted in his mind.<br><br>
He visualises, then, a Board of seven, with one vacancy arising. But there is another possible picture. The quorum for the Board is three. Under the Bill, unamended, there could be as few as only three members of the Board altogether, or even, more doubtfully, two; and while that situation existed threre could be a vacancy, so that for some months there would not be a quorum, therefore, there would not be a Board at all. That position could arise quite readily with a small Board of three without anyone even being absent through illness. We can visualise this circumstance quite easily. One out of seven would not matter so much; but with a Board of even four and a vacancy arising, it would be down to three, while if the Board happened to have only three members it could be down to two so that there would be no quorum and in fact no Board. That situation could arise.<br><br>
It would be a pity of there were a long-term vacancy in the Board; and since there is so much insistence on the time factor of three months as regards the obligations of members of the Board to attend meetings, I do not think it would be restricting the Secretary of State unduly to place a time limit on him in the filling of vacancies. Pressure is rightly put on members to attend the Board meetings and they can be sacked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0784">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
if they do not do so for three months, so I do not see why slackness on the part of the Secretary of State in filling a vacancy should be accepted.<br><br>
Nevertheless, in view of the arguments put forward by the Secretary of State, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> In page 11, line 36, leave out "Highland" and insert "Highlands and Islands".—[<i>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With Amendment No. 126 I think it would be convenient to consider also Amendments No. 127, in page 11, line 44, leave out "pensions" and insert "grant, pension or gratuity"; No. 128, in page 12, leave out lines 1 to 6; No. 131; and No. 132.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 126, in page 11, line 42, after "Treasury", to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"to make provision for the payment on his death or retirement of any grant, pension or gratuity".</p></blockquote>
These three Amendments, No. 126, No. 127 and No. 128 are really drafting Amendments. It seems to me that it would be simpler if paragraph 6<i>(b)</i> read as these Amendments would have it read. For the convenience of Members of the Committee, I will read out that paragraph as it would be if these Amendments were accepted:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board …<i>(b)</i> as regards any members"—</p></blockquote>
I think there should be an additional Amendment here because I have put it in the singular—
<br><blockquote><p>"in whose case the Secretary of State may so determine with the approval of the Treasury to make provision for the payment on his death or retirement of any grant, pension or gratuity shall make provision for or pay to or in respect of them such grant, pension or gratuity as may be so determined."</p></blockquote>
It is a small point, but it seems to me that it embraces all that is contained in the rather more lengthy wording as it at present stands, including the Minister's short Amendment that pensions should include gratuity. I am not pressing this; there is very little in it; but it does seem to me that this would be a shorter and neater way of dealing with the provision which paragraph 6<i>(b)</i> seeks to achieve.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On looking at these Amendments put down by the right hon. and hon. and learned Gentlemen opposite we thought that they were really concerned about the omission of "gratuity". We did not think they were challenging the drafting, and we have, of course, as the hon. and learned Gentleman will know, put down Amendments to include "gratuity". Personally, I thought a grant was a gratuity, and I understand that legally there is no difference between the two. I made special inquiries to find out what the difference, if any, was, and I was assured that there was no difference. However, in order to catch up the omission of "gratuity" we have put down Amendments Nos. 131 and 132.<br><br>
Now the hon. and learned Gentleman says that it was not the absence of the word "gratuity" that worried him but the drafting of the paragraph. I will have a look at this drafting again before Report to see what can be done. I must admit I did not look at it before, because I did not think that was the point at which the Amendments were aimed. I thought it was the "gratuity" point, and I have tried to meet that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendment made:</i> In page 12, line 6, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this paragraph any reference to a pension includes a reference to a gratuity".—[<i>Mr. Willis.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the next Amendment, No. 52, we will also take Amendment No. 118.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 8, to leave out from "be" to "from" in line 9 and to insert "as the Board shall itself".<br><br>
This is actually a very small, simple Amendment which I think would improve the Bill slightly. If we look at paragraph 7 we find that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The quorum of the Board shall be three or such larger number as the Board may from time to time determine."</p></blockquote>
My Amendment would make it read:
<br><blockquote><p>"The quorum of the Board shall be as the Board shall itself from time to time determine."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0785">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
I think in view of the discussion that we had earlier this morning about the various possibilities of the size of the Board this Amendment is even more valid. I do not see why we have to tie the Board as regards the size of its quorum. Surely this is something which it is capable of deciding for itself quite reasonably. It may be that it will want to vary the quorum from time to time; it may be that it would prefer some other method; and I do not see why we have to lay down its procedure and go into such detail. I think it would be quite reasonable for the Minister to accept this. I certainly do not think it would do any harm, and it would give the Board that little bit of extra freedom in regard to its own procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. MacMillan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I did not see my hon. Friend for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) rising; I meant no discourtesy.<br><br>
It is quite common form to put into the Statutes the size of the quorum of a body which is set up. For instance, this is done in the case of the Crofters Commission and the Red Deer Commission—no, I think I am wrong about that. I think I had better—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Start again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I think I had better stick to the brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I really called Mr. MacMillan. Does he wish to speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend any discourtesy to my hon. Friend in cutting him out and I appreciate that he intended none to me because he is never discourteous.<br><br>
May I say that I disagree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) about the Amendments? Because I believe the Minister is right to lay down three as the minimum quorum. There should be always a set minimum for the purpose of a quorum. I do not think that, in the present state of this Bill, this can safely be left wholly to the Board in view of the present fluid situation regarding the size and numbers of the Board. If it were a Board of seven, one would not have to worry so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 836</span>
much; but if it were a very small Board some curious things might happen. In arranging a quorum for a Board of three one could get some very odd situations, indeed. This suggested freedom of the Amendment might be all right with a fully manned Board of seven with a reasonable number of full-timers, but I am still worried about this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member a question? Surely he does not think the Board would be so irresponsible as to be unable to determine the quorum?</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend looks at my Amendment he will see the possibilities. There are so many complications still to be sorted out regarding numbers, and the smaller the Board the more interesting the range of possibilities. If one has a Board of three members sitting down to decide what a quorum shall be the most extraordinary situations can arise. This would involve the chairman as a necessary member of the quorum; but my point is that we must have three at least as a quorum because otherwise we may well get into an absolutely absurd situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind my hon. Friend that the quorum in the House of Lords is three?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The House of Lords' practice underlines the absurdity of such situations, and many others. Where there are many hundreds of members, as in the House of Lords, they should find no difficulty in forming a quorum, though often enough they just about manage it.<br><br>
Quite apart from the absurdity of the situation which might arise, however, I must say that there must always be some absolutely clear minimum quorum. We have not yet had a clear statement as to the number of full time members of the Board and till that happens one cannot be at all sure where we stand. I hope my hon. Friend the Minister of State is going to insist on a quorum of, at least, three? Surely it is desirable in that case that all should be full time and more likely to be present. Otherwise the complete ineffectiveness of the Board's whole set up would cause a break-down and the work of the Board would be paralysed.<br><br>

I hope the Minister will stick to his brief on this matter. There could at all times be a reasonable quorum if, for example, the Board had seven Members; but I hope that the Minister will insist on there being a quorum of at least, three, while, above that, giving the Board power also to increase the number if it thinks fit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) because he has really put our case against this particular Amendment. I can say to him that the fact that we prescribe a quorum of at least three in the Bill does suggest that we have not got it in mind to have a Board of only three members. Certainly we intend to have a larger Board than that, precisely for the reasons given by my hon. Friend, and I cannot accept this Amendment. It would enable the Board to fix a quorum of two and I think hon. Members will agree that that would not be satisfactory. It would not convince people that the Board was the serious body which we want it to be, nor convince anyone in the Highlands that the Board was really doing its job. If the quorum was two it would not lead people to think that the Board was at all active and would tend to give a completely wrong idea; and for that reason, as well as others which I have mentioned, I hope the Amendment will not be pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to refer to Amendment No. 118 because I thought there had been developing silently during our discussion today the basis of agreement that this might be separately considered and that my hon. Friend would consider its acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee disposes of the present Amendment we can then come to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not press this Amendment. It is not something passionate to my heart, but one of the things which disappointed me was the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and the Minister of State quoting absurd examples of what the Board might do. There have been some quite <i>outre</i> examples given. I do not think reasonable people would ever dream of doing anything quite so absurd.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 838</span>
The Minister says a quorum of two might result, but that would not lead to a great deal of trust in the Highlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not accept, as the Bill stands, that one full-time member and one or two others could form a quorum? I assure him that that position could arise at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is a reasonable individual, but to suggest that a responsible board would decide on a quorum of two is really something not worthy of discussion which would further prolong the work of the Committee.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 18, in page 12, line 9, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>Provided that no fewer than three shall be full-time members and that one is the chairman or the deputy-chairman.</p></blockquote>
Much of the argument we have already heard applies here. I still accept the first arrangement that there should be a basic three full-time members with the Board—free to add others. I should say that it is always desirable that in the quorum there should be a reasonable basic working number including the chairman, or the deputy-chairman who should be always in charge of the proceedings. Hon. Members know that very often a chairman is the only person who reads all the Committee papers and who is continuously in touch with the secretariat. I suggest that either the full-time chairman, or his deputy, who should also be a full-time member, shall be in the chair and that if the quorum is three they should all be full-time members. I do press my hon. Friend to accept this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I am afraid I cannot accept it, because we do think that there might be as a result of its acceptance—and I do not put it any higher—a tendency to frustrate the Board in its work. The Committee has already accepted my Amendment that the majority, including the chairman, should be full-time members and clearly full-time members would be available for Board meetings. The risk which my hon. Friend fears is not likely to arise. Indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0787">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 839</span>
it is greatly minimised by the acceptance of my earlier Amendment. It might be that the composition of the Board were such that if there were five members, of whom two were part-time, one of the full-time members might not be available. In those circumstances the Board would be powerless to act, and that is a very real possibility, although I concede that it would not often be likely to arise. Again, the Board might not be able to meet for two or three months if, for example, there had been death or illness or some other incident.<br><br>
Further if the chairman or deputy chairman was absent—or, if no deputy chairman had been appointed, the chairman was away because of illness—it would be impossible to hold any valid meetings of the Board at all. These do seem to me to be possibilities that might arise if my hon. Friend's Amendment was accepted. Such circumstances really could result in the frustration of the Board's work. I may also say that from the purely legal and technical point of view the wording of the Amendment is defective. The Secretary of State has discretion about the appointment of a deputy chairman and if we accepted this Amendment there would have to be an alteration in the wording to take account of that discretion.<br><br>
In the circumstances therefore I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with one valid point my hon. Friend has made. If no deputy has been appointed and the chairman is absent there would be difficulties: but I should have thought that we could have ensured here that there must be a full-time deputy chairman. But, without this and in the absence of any definite provision for a deputy chairman then there could be frustration. It is, however, a fairly valid point that the three members should be full-time, and I do ask my hon. Friend if he would at least consider that point before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Committee being told that, assuming the absence of the chairman and the absence of the potential vice-chairman, the Board would not have the power to appoint a temporary chairman?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment states that one of those present must be specifically the chairman or the deputy chairman; not the temporary chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My Amendment does nothing to prevent special temporary arrangements. I will withdraw the Amendment, but would my hon. Friend at least say that if there are three members as a quorum, they will be full-time members? Will my hon. Friend consider that before Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of that assurance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 21, to leave out from "matter" to "a" in line 22 and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"but may nevertheless be taken into account for the purpose of constituting".</p></blockquote>
This Amendment also deals with the question of the quorum and allows an interested party—a member of the Board who has an interest in the subject being discussed—to be counted as part of the quorum. I wonder if the Minister of State realises that this is identical with wording proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) to the Cereals Marketing Bill? On that occasion the Government accepted the Amendment, and the reason behind my Amendment this morning is one of convenience. There may be occasions, particularly in view of the long distances involved in travelling in the Highlands, when it may be difficult for all the members of the Board to be available for a meeting, and the question whether the meeting can be held with a quorum or not may well depend on this point. It might be discovered that one of the members had an interest, and specifically because of those circumstances the Board might lose its quorum. I raise this as a matter of the convenience of the working of the Board and emphasise that the principle has already been accepted in the Cereals Marketing Act.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of this Amendment would be to allow a member of the Board to be counted towards a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0788">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
quorum of it for any decision on a matter in which the member has a declared interest while still debarring him from taking any part in discussion or decision. The Amendment, if accepted, could produce a situation in which, with a quorum of three members, two of whom had an interest in the particular contract under consideration, the decision would be taken by the vote of a single member.<br><br>
The only precedent for this sort of thing is the Bill mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, the Cereals Marketing Bill, and I remember its going through, but the circumstances of the Cereals Marketing Authority are rather different. It has a large membership of 21 to 23, including 18 trading and producer members many of whom might have an interest in a contract and would have to withdraw. During Committee on that Bill it was pointed out that, because of this trading representation on the Authority it was more than likely that quite a large number of them might be concerned with some of the matters before it. There would, however, almost certainly be a number of members, apart from the non-voting interested members, counting towards the quorum of the Authority.<br><br>
On the other hand, with a Board with a very small number of members there is a risk of a decision about a contract resting solely upon one member. For this reason we do not think the Amendment is desirable, and we would prefer to leave paragraph 10(1) of the Schedule as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has put forward is very largely a matter of numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But I should like to point out to him that there could be a situation where the Board was holding a meeting with exactly the right number of persons for a quorum and then, because one of the members declared an interest which had not been realised before, the meeting was rendered nugatory. I do not think the Minister has really answered this point.<br><br>
The matter of numbers in relation to the Cereals Marketing Authority does not really alter the point. It has been agreed on both sides that we expect to see this Board acting as a responsible body, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
I do not think this Board would go ahead with taking decisions on the basis of one vote. I consider that we have made a case for this Amendment, which the Minister has not really answered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the position which I mentioned is not likely to arise, but, nevertheless, it is a possibility. However, if the hon. Gentleman feels that there is something in it I shall look at this point again before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has said that he will look at it again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the next Amendment, No. 129, I suggest to the Committee that we might also consider No. 130, in page 12, line 48, to leave out from "Board" to "pay" in page 13, line 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 44, to leave out from "may" to "determine" in line 45.<br><br>
This is very much the same kind of short point as that which was raised on Clause 9. The Committee will remember that we suggested that it was going rather far to prevent the Board from making whatever charges it thought appropriate for its services without going to the Secretary of State, and the Minister was good enough to accept that suggestion ultimately. I hope that he will accept this one, because a statutory body of this nature ought to be able to employ its own typists and doorkeepers and to pay them both salary and pension without having to go to the Secretary of State and getting the approval of the Treasury. It is an exceedingly small point, and in view of the very commendable attitude which the Minister showed in regard to a similar suggestion about Clause 9 we have every confidence that these two short Amendments will be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not intend to create the situation which the hon. and learned Gentleman visualises, that the Board cannot employ a doorman or a secretary without going to the Secretary of State or the Treasury. As the paragraph is worded it does not mean to say that every appointment to the Board's staff will have to be approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury. What is envisaged is that the staffing complement and ranges
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0789">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
of salaries for the various grades will be agreed by the Board with the Secretary of State and the Treasury. Thereafter, within this complement, and within these ranges of salaries, the Board will be free to appoint staff and to fix their remuneration without reference to the Secretary of State or the Treasury. The Board will of course, be free to seek the approval of the Secretary of State at any time to new posts urgently required and for which no provision has been made, or to pay salaries for the particular posts outwith the agreed ranges.<br><br>
We intend to give the Board as free a hand as possible in this field, and also as regards the pension arrangements for their staff, but it is, after all, public money which is being spent, and it is essential that there should be some broad control over the number of staff employed by the Board, and also over the remuneration, allowances and pensions payable. This paragraph is also designed to keep them in line with pay, allowances and pensions payable in other Government or Government-financed services.<br><br>
So I do not think there is any need for this Amendment, and we think that the paragraph is satisfactory as it is. It fits in with general practice, and we think that the arguments in favour of keeping it as it is are really rather stronger than those put forward by the hon. and learned Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is what is intended, that is certainly not what is said. What the paragraph says is:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board <i>(a)</i> may employ such officers and servants, and pay to them such remuneration and allowances as the Board may … determine".</p></blockquote>
In between "may" and "determine" the paragraph says that there has to be approval of the Secretary of State and the Treasury. I do not think that this is a major point. I understand the point which the hon. Gentleman has made, and I appreciate what is intended here, but it is not well expressed. I think that it could have been better expressed.<br><br>
However, in view of the explanation of what is intended, and as this is an administrative matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this Schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State announced during the Second Reading of the Bill that we hoped to set up the Board at the Cameron Barracks in Inverness, but since then we have discovered that this will not be possible because there is a great deal of work to be done there. We now propose to establish the Board in the first place in temporary quarters in the centre of Inverness with a main office in Bridge Street, and the question of permanent accommodation is being left over meanwhile. I thought I should mention this in view of what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment made:</i> In page 13, line 21, leave out "Highland" and insert" Highlands and Islands".—[<i>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 13, line 24, at the beginning to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"1. No member of the Board shall also be a member of the Council".</p></blockquote>
This is also a simple Amendment, but none the less an important one. I shall not delay the Committee for very long, because I want to spend a little more time on the Amendments which follow. The function of the Board and the function of the Council are quite separate, and I do not think they should be allowed to overlap. We established earlier that the function of the Council is primarily representative, rather than advisory in the specialist sense. That being the case, it is likely that one might expect there to be a certain degree of interaction between the Council and the Board, and I do not think that the Council should be hampered or intimidated in any res-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0790">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 845</span>
pect by having among its membership an actual member of the Board.<br><br>
Secondly, I do not think that the Board members will have time to do more than their own work on the Board. They should not be burdened by extra work on the Council. I have heard it suggested that the chairman of the Council might be a member of the Board, and if this rumour has any foundation it is something to which I should be very strongly opposed. The Council should be quite free to express its opinion, and it should be a separate organisation with no overlap.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman in his desire, but I have just been looking at the structure of the sentence. I do not like sentences which include the words "No member" because "No member" cannot be a "member" of anything. Before Report the hon. Gentleman might reconsider the wording, and simply say that a member of the Board shall not also be a member of the Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not press this Amendment, because we feel that if it is possible for a member of the Board to be a member of the Council this might at times be quite useful. There is no intention that the Council should act as Yes men to the Board, or that they should be under the thumb of the Board.</span></p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I hope the hon. Gentleman will not press this Amendment because, whilst we intend the Council to raise matters on its own initiative and to offer views and advice—and we have no intention that the Council should act as Yes men to the Board—nevertheless we feel that we should not exclude the possibility of having a member of the Board on the Council. We feel that it might have considerable advantages administratively and in relation to communication between the two bodies. In other words it might enable each body to understand the viewpoint of the other body, some of the difficulties which they are up against, and the reasons lying behind what they are doing and suggesting. For this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
reason we feel that a link between the two is desirable. It would depend to a large extent on the membership of the Board, the number of members, and the availability of members, but we would not like to see the possibility excluded. On balance, we consider that it would be desirable to have some link between the two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend closes his mind to this, has he considered the possibilities of the situation in reverse? We have had the experience of the chairman of an advisory board—for example in the case of the Scottish Civil Aviation Advisory Council—actually <i>ex officio</i> sitting on the B.E.A. Board. Perhaps, the possibility might be kept in mind that the Minister may want the chairman of the Consultative Council—which is to be so broadly representative of places, interests, and people in the Highlands, perhaps even more representative than the Board itself—to be a member of the Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the possibilities we have in mind, and once again is one of the reasons we would not like to accept the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member wish to withdraw his Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in difficulty. I appreciate the argument put forward by the hon.

It might be a good thing to do in reverse, but I am not convinced of the argument the other way. In view of the fact that the Minister has said this may only occur in exceptional circumstances, I shall not press the Amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 56, in page 13, line 24, at the beginning, to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>1. The Council shall be limited to 70 members.</p></blockquote>
I wish to take a little time on this, for the form which the Consultative Council will take is an important matter. We have gone with some care through this Bill, which sets up a Board whose powers are extremely wide, and in some cases very nearly totalitarian, subject to all sorts of provisions. One accepts that these wide powers are necessary, having regard to the particular circumstances which the Board will face. Nevertheless, it is vital that, in regard to the activities of the Board, the authentic voice of the Highlands should not be stifled.<br><br>
When one comes to look at the Bill and to the actual form of the Council, one finds that it is primarily of a representative character. The Schedule says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council shall include a member or members representative of local authority interests and such other interests as the Secretary of State may think fit."</p></blockquote>
I submit that the local authority interests ought to be safeguarded by Statute rather than be left simply to the direct appointment of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
My Amendment is based on two premises. The first is that the Board requires a counter balance. It requires a Council which speaks for the people of the area and which represents their views—this is a very important matter. Secondly, I consider that in setting up the Board we are taking a step which in the future is going to be tremendously important to local government. We are taking the first step towards the setting up of regional authorities and of regional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
councils. We are taking a step towards the modernisation of local government. We are not taking it in a very certain way, but we are feeling our way in a certain direction. Therefore, we ought to begin to think about how the democratic ideas, aspirations, feelings of a region are best expressed. Are they best expressed through a Council which is appointed purely by the Secretary of State, or ought they not better to find expression through a Council which has a certain statutory representative form?<br><br>
As one can see from Amendments No. 56 and No. 57, my intention is that it should be a large Council. In later Amendments I see that the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) disagrees with me. It is a somewhat contradictory state of affairs in that here am I advocating a small Board whereas the hon. Member for the Western Isles advocates a large Board; and when I am now advocating a large Council the hon. Member for the Western Isles advocates a small one.<br><br>
None the less the first thing I am suggesting is that it should be a large Council. If the Council is to be properly representative, particularly as it covers such a large area of seven counties, it must be large in order to be representative in any real sense.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Under the suggested form that I have given here, Members of Parliament would be entitled to serve on the Council. They were entitled to serve on the Highland Panel. The function of this Council is rather different from that of the Highland Panel. The Highland Panel did produce detailed documents which could be examined by the Secretary of State; it was often producing specialist advice. I do not really think the Minister has it in mind that this Consultative Council should be a council of that kind. Nevertheless, if it is to be representative, which I think he accepts in principle, then Members of Parliament have a rightful place on the Council, because they, by mere virtue of the job which they hold down, are moving about their constituencies, and as much as any single individual can be in a constituency, are in touch with all sorts of movements, developments, trends and feelings, and are consequently well able to express
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0792">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 849</span>
them. This applies irrespective of party. A Member of Parliament merely because he is forced to move around a tremendous amount keeps in touch with feelings and takes account of them if he is fair-minded at all, even if they do not absolutely reflect his own views.<br><br>
Then there are the burgh councils and county councils. There are 20 small burghs and one large burgh in the seven crofting counties, the only large burgh being the town of Inverness. This is merely a method of representation and I am not by any means tied to that. I would like the Minister, when he replies, to consider the question of how the setting up of the Highland Development Board and the Council is inevitably going to effect the future shape and pattern of local government and the kind of level of democratic representation, and to think that perhaps we might start thinking of means to put this into effect.<br><br>
I suggest a Council with representation at three levels—the Parliamentary level, the county level and the small burghs level, which is getting fairly well down to the grass roots.<br><br>
I think I have outlined my arguments in fair detail. Lastly it is important—and I am sure the Minister is aware and conscious of this—that this Board, which has certainly been widely welcomed in the Highland area, should in its actual conduct not be seen as in any sense an authoritarian impress of the central Government but really should give and take with the people of the area. The people of the area ought to have some form of effective representation whereby they can make their thoughts, feelings and attitudes known to the Board so that the Board itself may take proper cognisance of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For very good reasons, I prefer my own Amendment to that of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). I really honestly think that 70 on a consultative committee is going to be terribly unwieldy.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly right—Consultative Council of course—but the 70 remains and that 70 terrifies me. The idea of a Consultative Council of

70, with, presumably, most of them there when the Council meets, is frightening.<br><br>
I have been on a number of bodies and I think the figure which the Minister has mentioned of somewhere about 25 or the 30 maximum I have mentioned is really about as much as any such body can effectively handle or about as many members as can actively participate in the work of the Council when it comes to the deliberations. I do not think that 70 people can actively participate in the counsels of a body of this kind and in its work. If we get 30 active members we shall be doing pretty well. In practice it will be found that a third or a half of them will be participating and active members and there will be a still smaller number of members who will study all the agendas and papers between meetings.<br><br>
The Consultative Council, if it follows the practice of the Highlands and Islands Advisory Panel, may have to move around physically to various places. To have 70 members, if they all attended, moving around would be a major exercise in transportation alone, apart from anything else. It is terribly unwieldy.<br><br>
As to Members of Parliament as members of it, well, I do not think I want to be a member of the Consultative Council. I do not think so. Can we imagine the Parliamentary situation, as things are at present, where several Members on both sides would have to withdraw themselves for a number of days, as we had frequently to do on the Highlands and Island Panel, from their Parliamentary duties at which they represent the people of our own constituencies—indeed, the whole of the Highlands and Islands? The primary duty of Members is to be at their Parliamentary work in one form or another and, in the present Parliamentary situation, it would be difficult for Members in addition to do this new work.<br><br>
I also think it would be wiser for them to retain their freedom of criticism both of the Board and the Consultative Council. I know the hon. Member has in mind that hon. Members might influence the Council's deliberations and its views and the results of its deliberations from within. I am not quite so sure about that, especially with 70 there. The number of M.P.s mentioned is six, and among 20 to 30 members they might assume considerable significance, but even so I do not know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0793">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 851</span>
whether they would be more influential outside or inside. It depends upon how many of the Council, or the M.P.s, turn up.<br><br>
On the sheer practical question of participation in the actual working of the Council a number like 70 is, therefore, impossible and 30 is still more than enough. I am sure that is the case.<br><br>
Under the Amendment I have put before the Committee there will be a representative from each of the Parliamentary constituencies in the Highlands and Islands and that covers, at least territorially, all the Parliamentary divisions and I think that the hon. Member for Inverness knows why that Amendment is down. It might well happen that we have a member for Inverness-shire representing Inverness but leaving out Skye and the Outer Isles. I think the hon. Member probably agrees with my Amendment. It cannot operate the other way. It is difficult to imagine anyone sent up to represent all of Ross-shire being sent from Lewis with Ross-shire mainland overlooked.<br><br>
It is important that the Island areas should have some special emphasis in the selection of members of the Consultative Council. I want to see local government interests active on the Consultative Council; but I am not sure that I want to see every local authority, every small burgh, the large Burgh of Inverness and every county sending up a large list of candidates for the Council. The Secretary of State would be put in the impossible position of having to reject many of them. There would be rows from the start and he would be put in a most invidious position. It is important that relations between Secretary of State, the Board and local bodies and people should be sweet from the beginning of this operation. I can imagine how many Councils and nominees would feel hurt if Inverness County Council sends up its own panel, the large Burgh of Inverness sends its selection and each small burgh sends its own group only to have many rejected.<br><br>
I know it has been said it would be difficult enough to get the minimum number of suitable people for the Consultative Council and Board. I believe, however, that if we do it this way the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 852</span>
Member for Inverness suggests the Secretary of State may be flooded with unsuitable people. The number of influences and interests which can be brought to bear within any local authority, as we all know, to create little preferential panels of people, can be quite terrifying. I would hate the Minister of State or the Secretary of State to have to face hundreds of nominees, out of whom to pick 70, when they find it difficult enough, even given completely free choice, to get a minimum of suitable people for the Board and the Consultative Council.<br><br>
I would say that we should keep the number down to a number that will in practice participate—and they should be expected to participate. This smaller, yet still representative body can be better observed and criticised from outside by M.P.s rather than from inside, with the limitations created by actual membership on the freedom of Members of Parliament. Do not let us have nominees panels from counties and from every other local authority. The Minister should be given a free hand with which to draw in the membership of his Consultative Council, while carefully keeping localities and interests in mind. The hon. Member for Inverness knows what I am getting at without my being unsympathetic to his aim of getting the best and widest representation of the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister of State will resist this Amendment. I agree with almost everything the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has said.<br><br>
There are three small points. It is really a bad principle in an Act of Parliament to tie things down as closely as this Amendment proposes. It is ridiculous to do that. I personally would be prepared to give the Secretary of State confidence in this matter, whether he is on the other side or our own side.<br><br>
Two other small points. Suppose there is an alteration in local government structure in future, which is quite possible, this Amendment if it were incorporated in the Bill, would need alteration and then we would be faced with more legislation. Lastly, if the Secretary of State is not acting properly and something is going wrong, then he can be got at in the House by Members of Parliament.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 853</span>
So I hope the Minister will resist the Amendment. I agree that the Council should be fairly small. I am not prepared to tie him down to any particular number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three issues are raised by this group of Amendments. The first is the size of the Council itself. The second concerns Amendment No. 85 and whether the word "transport" should be included. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) is moving that or not. The third item is the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) concerning representation of Parliamentary constituencies.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
The important matter we are discussing is the idea of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) of turning this Council into a sort of regional council. I think he said that we are really here experimenting in a form of regional Government. I do not necessarily accept that analogy because the Consultative Council is in fact not a government, but a council to advise. We have decided that the particular work which should be done in the Highlands should not be done by a regional authority but by a small executive body. We have made that choice, and, therefore, the analogy drawn by the hon. Gentleman does not seem to me to be altogether a good one. Nevertheless I understand the reasons which prompted this Amendment. I believe I understand the thinking behind it and that he was visualising that this might become a regional authority or, as he put it, an experiment in this direction.<br><br>
We have rejected that particular idea as regards the task which the Board has to tackle in the Highlands area, and one indication is that we do not remove from any existing local authorities the powers they already have. In fact, it becomes obligatory to work with them. If we are to reform local government it will have to be done in a rather different manner. When we come to examine this body as a consultative body, which is what it is, then 70 members certainly seems to be a great many and it would be far too large for effective discussions. I understand that the recent experiment of increasing the number of members of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 854</span>
Highland Panel has not been too successful in improving the proceedings of that body, so numbers do not necessarily make for good consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister whether he is indulging in a criticism of the Scottish Grand Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not of the opinion that the 70, 80 or 90 members of the Scottish Grand Committee make as good a committee as the smaller Standing Committees of 30 or 40.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that whatever else we get we do not want this Consultative Council taking as long over its deliberations as the Scottish Grand Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, of course.<br><br>
I am not convinced that a committee of 70 to 80 members produces better discussions than one of 20 or 30 members. I think such a body would be rather unwieldy and that the hon. Gentleman is proceeding from the wrong basis, because I do not believe the analogy he makes between a form of regional authority and an advisory council is a good one.<br><br>
As regards Members of Parliament on the Consultative Council, I do not think that is necessarily a good thing either. I understand that recently very few Members of Parliament have in fact attended the meetings of the Highland Panel. Quite clearly Members of Parliament, as my hon. Friend pointed out, have jobs of work to do down here and at the moment, with the present position in the House of Commons, they are pretty full-time jobs no matter what side of the House a Member is on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the election there has been no re-invitation to Members of Parliament to serve on the Highland Panel. That is probably the simple reason why they do not attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But I understand that, even before that, not many Members attended. I believe that only one has attended with any degree of regularity during recent years. I am not saying that in criticism of the Members, for I think it arises from the fact that they have a job down here which prevents their taking part in a great number of the discussions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0795">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 855</span>
I think the main thing is that this is not an authority but an advisory Council, and we feel we can get better discussions if we limit the number of members to something like 25, 30 or 35.<br><br>
With regard to the Amendment which would limit us to 29, once again I would ask my hon. Friend not to tie the Secretary of State. The figure of 29 is actually more in accordance with what we have in mind, as I indicated previously, but it is possible that we might want an extra one or two, making 30, or 32, depending on how we find it necessary to secure the representation of various interests in the Highlands. Therefore I would ask my hon. Friends not to press that either. I have given an explanation of what we have in mind—something around 25 or 30, or perhaps one or two more.<br><br>
The last Amendment, No. 58, is that of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles, which seeks to secure the representation of Parliamentary constituencies in the Highlands and Islands, and I can quite clearly follow the working of his mind on this, because I can visualise that one might get representation from Ross and Cromarty which would not include those parts of Ross and Cromarty in his constituency, and representation from Inverness that might tend to include the mainland and not the Islands in his constituency. I have a great deal of sympathy with this Amendment because I think it important that the Western Isles should be represented. Indeed, I think all parts must be represented. But whether this is the best way to do it, simply by Parliamentary representation, or whether we should seek to do it by trying to get some geographical distribution put in, I am not quite certain. However, I am prepared to look at an Amendment to try and put something into the Bill to achieve what my hon. Friend wants and ensure that the Western Isles are represented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt again, but would the Minister of State, when looking into this, also look at this rather similar problem of island representation as a whole, because some constituencies, like mine, have quite a number of islands, and in the islands there are particularly difficult problems, and the islanders often feel they do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 856</span>
perhaps get as much say as they feel they ought to have because of their problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one reason why I said I thought it might be better to try to do something on a geographical basis rather than on a Parliamentary constituency basis. But I think the purpose is the same and I am prepared to look at that too.<br><br>
In view of that, I hope my hon. Friend will not press the Amendment because I give him that specific undertaking to try to get something into the Bill on Report.<br><br>
To sum up briefly, I am afraid I must reject Amendments No. 56, No. 57 and No. 119. I understand that Amendment No. 85 is not being moved. I undertake to look at Amendment No. 58 to try to get the meaning of this into the Bill at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, I do not propose to press my two Amendments, but I would like to correct one slight misrepresentation by the Minister of State. I was not thinking in terms of regional government overnight, but that we begin by having an evolving structure and ought to start somewhere. I do not wish to press the Amendments which I appreciate are probably not suitably worded. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 14, line 4, after first "of", to insert "loss of earnings and".<br><br>
I think this Amendment meets the point of the Amendment put down by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). I think he had a point and we have tried to meet it, so I hope he will accept my Amendment rather than his own.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule, as amended, agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we finally part with this Bill I would like on behalf of all of us on this side of the Committee to express our thanks to you, Mr. Steele, for the manner in which you have conducted the proceedings of this Commit-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0796">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 857</span>
tee. You have treated our discussions fairly, firmly, and in a very pleasant manner—good humouredly—and we are very grateful for that. I am quite sure that your own attitude in the Chair to the proceedings and to the Members on both sides of the Committee has added very greatly to the generally pleasant manner in which our business has been conducted, and on behalf of my hon. Friends I should just like to say, Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree unreservedly, for once, with the hon. Gentleman, who made a very appropriate speech, and just add to what he has had to say that I think that Members on this side of the Committee, if at one moment they got a little heated, did so for only a very short moment. The result has been that we have completed this Bill as quickly as many of us hoped, and even a little more quickly than some of us feared. If that has been to some extent due to the co-operation of both sides of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 858</span>
Committee, that co-operation has been helped by the way you have taken the Chair, Mr. Steele.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to thank the hon. and right hon. Gentlemen for their very kind remarks. May I say that this Committee generally has been under some criticism in the past with regard to the conduct of its proceedings and I felt and hoped that under my Chairmanship we would proceed in a proper manner. In any case, after some initial difficulty, I must confess that I had the co-operation of the Members of the Committee, and for that I thank everybody concerned.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Ordered,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p></blockquote></p>
