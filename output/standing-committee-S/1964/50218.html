	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed, [16th February],</i> in page 1, line 19, leave out "think fit" and insert "deem advisable."—	<i>[Mr. Wylie.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), was about to say something. I had the impression that he had risen to his feet. I do not know whether he wishes to pursue his argument before I say anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I was going to say, assuming that the hon. Lady had finished what she was saying about the Amendment, was that I was sorry that she was not able to accept it. This is a fine point, and not a material one, but I would have thought it would improve the drafting of the Bill. If, however, the hon. Lady is not able to accept the Amendment, I shall withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to add something which I thought might help. As the Committee will remember, we were talking about whether "deem advisable" was better than "think fit" in terms of whether this Council has the function of an advisory or an executive council. I tried to explain that it was something between the two, and the hon. and learned Gentleman thought that his Amendment suited the Bill better. He argued that the words "think fit" were appropriate for bodies with executive powers, rather than for those with advisory powers, or powers between the two. I think that he may be interested to recollect that Section 73(2) of the Education
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
(Scotland) Act, 1962, which refers to the Advisory Council for Education, says that provision should be made
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the reports of special committees to be submitted to the Secretary of State by the advisory council, who shall be entitled in submitting the reports to make such comments thereon as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
Even if we accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's view that this is an advisory council, "as they think fit" seems to be accepted as appropriate for such bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been used in the past, but I thought that it would be neater drafting to use the words "deem advisable" rather than "think fit". However, I do not press the Amendment, and, as it is not to be accepted, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment selected is No. 9, and I think that it would be convenient for the Committee to discuss Amendment No. 13 as well, in page 2, line 4, leave out "as they think fit or".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering whether it would be convenient to take them together. I wonder whether I may deal with No. 9 at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Member objects to taking them together, I will call him to move Amendment No. 9 on its own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 3, to leave out "other".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that it shall be the duty of the Council
	<br><blockquote><p>"to consider, and make to the Secretary of State from time to time recommendations on, such other matters relating to the education, training and fitness to teach of teachers as they think fit or as may be referred to them by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the use of the word "other" is not altogether appropriate, because subsection (1) contains wide powers for the Council to make recommendations on its own initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This subsection deals with recommendations on matters referred to it by the Secretary of State. It may be a small point, but is seems that there is a wide power to initiate recommendations under subsection (1). In subsection (3) we are dealing with a different situation, or we ought to be dealing with a different situation, in so far as we are dealing with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
matters referred to the Council by the Secretary of State. Subsection (3) provides for the Council to make recommendations relating to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"education, training and fitness to teach of teachers as they think fit or as may be referred to them by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that there is some confusion of thought there. The Council already has powers to make recommendations on its own initiative under subsection (1), and subsection (3) really refers to powers to make recommendations on matters referred to it by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should explain why we think this "other" is necessary. Subsection (3) requires the Council to deal with matters relating to teacher training other than those connected with entry to initial training for the profession, as is provided for in subsections (1) and (2). The omission of the word "other" would largely defeat the purpose of the subsection, in that the matters which the Council would be required to deal with under subsection (3) would not be easily distinguishable—in fact I doubt whether one could distinguish them—from those with which it would be concerned under subsections (1) and (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that what the hon. and learned Gentleman is trying to do is to make a drafting Amendment which he thinks will improve the Bill, but I think he has overlooked what the other matters might be, and why it is important to distinguish these from those in subsections (1) and (2). It would cover other matters relating to professional training such as, for example, in-service training, the whole idea of refresher courses, courses which provide for in-service training, for example a Brunton-type course, new methods of primary teaching, and so on. All these kinds of in-service training would be covered only if the word "other" were included in subsection (3). They would not easily be covered under subsections (1) and (2), which relate rather to people entering teaching and the kind of training which is needed for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all kinds of examples where in-service training is becoming more and more important. For example, courses in the use of television, and courses in all those things where newer methods are devised. If education is to keep up to date, it is necessary that there should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
an opportunity for teachers already in service to have courses provided for them. It is intended that this "other" in subsection (3) will give the Council the opportunity to consider and make recommendations on this kind of thing. If "other" were left out, this could not be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a case of where the initiative lies? In subsection (1) the initiative is wtih the Council. Will the initiative lie with the Secretary of State in subsection (3)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. The initiative may lie with either, because in subsection (3) these other matters which the Council will have the duty of considering may arise from its own initiative, or, as we see later in the subsection, may be referred to it by the Secretary of State. Thus, whether the Secretary of State wants the Council to consider these questions of in-service training, or whether the Council, on the basis of its own experience and knowledge, decides that it ought to think about these other matters, the word "other" needs to be in the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) ought to tell us why he moved the Amendment. Judging from his remarks, he ought to have moved an Amendment to delete subsection (3), because he thought that the point there was covered by an earlier subsection. Obviously he would agree that matters should be referred to the Council by the Secretary of State if he thinks fit, or the Council should consider matters as it thinks fit. It seems wrong to take out the word "other". I think that there is some misunderstanding about this, and perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will clear it up. If he does not want the Secretary of State to have this power, he should move an Amendment to delete subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make was that we have wide powers to initiate recommendations under subsection (1), and therefore subsection (3) ought to be confined to recommendations by the Council on matters referred to it by the Secretary of State. That is the purpose of the next Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to what the hon. Lady has said. I think that it is quite clear—and I am obliged to the hon. Lady for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
her explanation—that the powers of initiation under subsection (1) are not wide enough for her purposes, and that therefore there should be further powers of initiation on other matters under subsection (3). In the light of that explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment. It was largely of a probing nature, and I am satisfied with the explanation that I have been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wylie. Amendment No. 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not now propose to move Amendment No. 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on this Clause. It has taken a little longer than most of us thought it would, and I therefore do not want to extend it to any great length. From the discussions which we have had on this Clause it is clear that we are all agreed—or at least I think we are all agreed—that the wording of the Clause needs a little more thought by the hon. Lady and her right hon. and hon. Friends before we come to the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate there has been some doubt, first, as to whether my intention in moving the few Amendments that I moved on Tuesday morning was in some way to curtail the functions of the Council. I should like to record that that is the last thing that I want to do. I realise that the Government are in some slight difficulty in drawing up the functions of this Council, because they are riding a rather careful balance between what the teachers in a perfect world would like to have and what the Secretary of State in an imperfect world feels he has to have in the way of control for the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the hon. Lady considers the Clause before the next stage of the Bill she will give thought, as she has promised to do, to the clarification of the phrase "standards of education", and perhaps to the clarification or omission of words like "fitness to teach", because I feel that for the Council to be effective it must not only have reasonable powers, but they must be powers which do not cause worry, trouble, arguments, and perhaps even law cases, in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
I am glad that we finally cleared up the question about whether the Council was to have direct jurisdiction over teachers wishing to enter schools other than State schools or grant-aided schools. I thought that that small Amendment was useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee's deliberations last Tuesday will help the hon. Lady to get this Clause right, and will ensure that the Teaching Council, when it is set up, will appreciate that this Committee does not wish to curtail its powers beyond the extent to which is reasonable and necessary to enable the Secretary of State to look after his part in this great matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacPherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say very much, but I hope that the Committee will excuse me if I say something which is not relevant to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. I have acceded to the connection which my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. George Thomson) used to have with the Educational Institute of Scotland, but this will not in the slightest affect my opinions about education which from time to time have left me in a minority of one and which are still likely to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the debate on the Clause I was interested enough to read the report of it. One thing ought to be said about the series of debates on the Amendments. I compliment my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for the admirable lucidity of her explanations. Anyone reading her statements in the course of these debates must be struck by the clearness with which she explained the points at issue. There have been occasions when such explanations were necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, however, that she found it necessary to make some concession early on. She intends to reconsider certain phrases before the Report stage. It does not appear to me that there is any need for changes in those phrases. I am sure that before Report she will give her unbiased and conscientious attention to the question whether any such changes are necessary, but I shall not be sorry if we find that the phrases remain as they are after her consideration is over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite right that wide phrases should be used in the Clause. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
that it was not his intention to circumscribe the powers of the Council. But that would have been the effect of his Amendments. There is some difficulty in this connection, because education and educational policy are full of phrases which are not easy to define with any exactitude. There is the famous phrase "age, aptitude and ability." It is possible to define one's age, but aptitude and ability seem to me to be as inexact in their definition as any of the phrases used in this Clause. The sensible thing to do in setting up a Council of this sort is to provide it with powers and responsibilities which are wide enough, and then, where necessary, to narrow down the definitions in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not agree with the argument put forward by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) when he expressed doubts about the regulations which will be made. Those regulations will not be made under this Clause; the Council is given independent power of its own under a separate Clause. His arguments were not logically sound. The regulations and the way in which they will be made will be discussed when we reach the appropriate Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, the Clause should be accepted as it stands, because it sets out clearly what powers the Council should have in respect of standards of education, training and fitness to teach, in subsections (1) and (2), and in connection with other matters in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the hon. Member a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has sat down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have the highest respect for my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson), especially on a subject like education. I pay my personal tribute to him on that score. I am certain that all hon. Members will congratulate him on the fact that he now has a most important job in connection with teachers. The appointment could not have fallen into more capable hands, nor come within the compass of a wiser head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intervening not merely because my hon. Friend spoke, but because what
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
has been said during the debate on the Clause had to be said. I agree with my hon. Friend—and I have pointed it out myself—that in certain educational matters words are very difficult to come by, and that although certain connotations may be accepted among us it is almost impossible accurately to define them. Nevertheless, it was worth while having the discussion. My hon. Friend the Minister responded to the general feeling of the Committee when she said she would think over these matters before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all I want to say. I am sure that she will do so, and before sitting down I join with my hon. Friend in congratulating her on the very able and generous way in which she handled the various matters put before her by Members on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but it is necessary to take up one point made by the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson). No one on either side seeks to restrict the powers of the Council, but my hon. Friends and I seek to write into the Bill that which is capable of legal interpretation. It was with this object in view that we moved the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What struck me about the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs was that he seemed to sell the pass when he said, in connection with lines 15 and 16, on page 1, that they were "just as impossible of interpretation as". Those were his words. That is precisely the argument which is put forward by my hon. Friends and me. That is why I do not share the view alleged to have been expressed by the hon. Member for Falkirk and Stirling Burghs, until he sold the pass with the phrase to which I have referred, and I hope that the Minister will most seriously consider the difficulties of interpretation envisaged by those of us who are not satisfied with the Clause as it stands. I hope that she will carry out her promise to review the matter before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I hope that my hon. Friend will stick to the terms of the Clause as it is now. There seems to be some confusion over this matter. I do not claim any special power of interpretation, but as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
I understand the points which hon. Members opposite have been trying to make in assessing the standards referred to in lines 15 and 16 on page 1 they are already covered by existing legislation—the legislation introduced only in 1964 by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and the Training Regulations of 1958. The standards have already been set in that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to seek the co-operation of teachers' organisations, and, broadly, to lay down objectives which we all have. Hon. Members opposite may not think so. I agree that they do not intend to be restrictive, but some of their Amendments would have that effect. The last Amendment which we discussed would have restricted the recommendations made on "other matters" to recommendations made by the Secretary of State. As the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) appreciated eventually, his Amendment would have denied teachers the right themselves to consider questions other than the training and entry of teachers. That is the point at which hon. Members opposite seemed to suggest that the Council should be restricted as to the subject matter which it should consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought the present wording of the Clause to be right. We are too much inclined to think of particular standards which are already covered by other legislation or regulations. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend will retain the present wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The importance of the Clause lies in the heading under which it is included, namely, "General Functions of Council". It is therefore very important that the terms of the Clause should be kept wide. I am satisfied that my hon. Friend's words have more to recommend them than the words contained in the Amendments which we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed with the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). He had a good point, but he put it forward for the wrong reason. What he was concerned to do was to preserve certain features of educational privilege. I was very disappointed with the way in which he spoke of some of the Amendments. It would be utterly wrong if we determined
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
the power of the Council to deal with standards of entry on the wrong basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to define is what is relevant and what is not relevant for the Council. If it is relevant for it to consider qualifications, standards and fitness for entry to the teaching profession, that is good. That is as it should be. But if the intention is merely to put down some words and then, by the back door, allow people to enter the profession although they do not come up to the standards laid down, it is a bad thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that certain speeches by hon. Members opposite have suggested that the words do not matter. They do. If we are going to have unregistered teachers entering the profession the Clause as it stands is meaningless. It makes the whole business of the Council a sham. Great damage will be done to education in Scotland if there are any reservations about the meaning of "entry to the teaching profession", if it is thought that that does not cover every member of the profession. There would be bad feeling between the teachers and the Scottish Education Department, and education would take another slip back and we would have to have another battle within the Council to establish the meaning of the words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will bear that in mind when she and her right hon. Friend are giving this matter further consideration, and that she will see that the functions described are meaningful and are not just a set of words to disguise another intention. With that, I give the Clause my blessing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not expect me to reopen our discussions on subsection (2). I am very glad to have the assurance of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) about his intentions in the Amendment, and I completely accept it. We now know that both sides of the Committee are anxious in no way to circumscribe the powers of the Council, and I can assure hon. Members that of course I shall keep the undertaking which I gave on Tuesday. I do not make an undertaking rashly and, if I give an undertaking, I keep it. I shall consider very carefully whether we can find a way of meeting the feeling on both sides of the Committee about improvements to subsection (2).

We had a most useful discussion on Tuesday morning and I do not regret the time which we then spent, because we were all able to clarify and explore our own fundamental attitudes to the Council. We were forced into the position of defining attitudes towards the extent of the Council's powers and functions. For that reason, we have had a useful debate on the whole of the Clause and I am glad that the Committee is able to accept it with my earlier undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Clause 3.—(SUPPLY OF TEACHERS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 8, to leave out from "matters" to the end of the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is characteristic of the Government's attitude towards the Council. We are promised a Teaching Council to give control of the profession to the profession itself, but, although that is done with one hand, with the other hand the Government take away all the advantage. We all welcomed Lord Wheatley's Report as giving the profession the status it deserved. On this subject of teacher supply Lord Wheatley made no reservations in his recommendations. These recommendations are very short and are stated on page 48 of the Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, for some reason best known to themselves and about which we have not had an explanation, propose to remove all the teeth of those recommendations by refusing to allow the Council to discuss questions of remuneration and conditions of service, matters which are the whole crux of the case in the supply of teachers. Of course there are other considerations, such as training, but, when we get down to brass tacks, to consider the primary cause of the shortage of teachers, we are inevitably driven to the subject of remuneration and conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that there is nobody better qualified to discuss supply than the teachers themselves. The Secretary of State and local authorities may have a material interest in a contrary direction and may decide, having regard to the national economy, that the amount of
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
money available is limited, but in considering how to spend available resources, if they are wise, the Government will rely on the best possible advice they can get, and in this case that is from the profession itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a short Clause which puts on the Council a duty to make to the Secretary of State from time to time recommendations on such matters relating to the supply of teachers as it thinks fit, or as may be referred to it by the Secretary of State. That is precisely what Lord Wheatley advised. But then, for some reason, the essence of the recommendation is removed by the restriction that the Council must not deal with matters of remuneration and conditions of service. This makes the Clause utterly meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady may say that there is other machinery for this purpose, the Joint Council. That is true, but the Joint Council is a negotiating body, and both sides of it, professional and Government, would welcome such impartial advice as they would get from the new Council. The new Council is to include all sections of the profession, which is not true of the unions. Unfortunately, in that respect the profession is divided. It is painfully obvious to those outside it that there is very little unanimity in the profession on these matters and that the branches of the profession quarrel among themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, here we are to have a professional body of the very highest standing and representing all branches from university teachers downwards and able to consider these matters in a detached way and able to offer considered advice not only to the Government and the local authorities, but to the teachers' unions themselves. If the Clause is to have any meaning, this reservation must be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady may have good explanations which are not obvious to me, but I ask her to consider what I have said very carefully, for any explanation of a provision running contrary to the recommendations of the Wheatley Report must be very cogent if it is to be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand where the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) gets the impression that the Wheatley Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
intended that the matter of salaries and conditions of service should be a function of the Teaching Council. In paragraph 159 of the Wheatley Report he will see a very clear and itemised list of the functions to be performed by the new Council, but nowhere will he see in that any suggestion that salaries or conditions of service ought to be part of the Council's functions. On whatever else he may base his arguments, he cannot base his case on any impression that the Wheatley Report recommended what he has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that he would keep in existence the Scottish Joint Council for Teachers' Salaries, so that he is saying that on the one hand there should be the Joint Council, which is not a negotiating body but which carries out many functions closely associated with negotiations and which was set up by the right hon. Member for Argyll in March, 1964, to replace the former National Joint Council, which had dealt with salary matters for many years, and, on the other hand, the General Teaching Council which would also consider salaries. It is very important to avoid a situation in which, in considering questions of supply, as no doubt it will, the Teaching Council might be led into making recommendations on salaries, the concern of the Scottish Joint Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman seems to have in mind is that the General Teaching Council should become a sort of senior, high-powered, authoritative arbitration body. He must have that in mind, because he cannot mean it to be a body which negotiates. Yet he wants it to be able to consider salaries, so that all he can have in mind is a body of people at a level higher than the Joint Council, who will come down from on high, as it were, and say, "Whatever the Joint Council has said about salaries, we as the General Teaching Council are to say things which carry more weight than things said by the Joint Council". No trade unionist would be very happy with that sort of concept of an additional body with not very clear powers and not clearly defined as an arbitration body, or as a review body such as that set up under the Pilkington Report for doctors, with some rather nebulous powers to comment on, add to, and disagree with recommendations of the Joint Council for Teachers' Salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
That is why I cannot accept the Amendment. The Teaching Council has a substantial task in the carrying out of the functions which the Wheatley Committee envisaged without being given extra and rather vague tasks. If the hon. Gentleman had been arguing that we should so change the Bill as to provide for the Council to take over the present functions of the Joint Council, at least he would have had logic in his argment, althought I would still have opposed it strongly. The case he is now arguing lacks logic. I do not think that he has explored the implications of what he has proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment gives me some concern, because I have a great deal of sympathy with it. Despite what my hon. Friend has said, she will agree that we are not compelled to accept every word of the Wheatley Report. These are merely recommendations to us. It seldom happens that a Bill ultimately incorporates everything recommended in a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have to disagree with my hon. Friend about her interpretation of paragraph 159 of the Report and what is said about recruitment. She challenged the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) to say where in its Report the Wheatley Committee said that the new Council should be concerned with salaries and conditions of service, but I challenge her to say where it specifically excludes them. Subparagraph 	<i>(b)</i> of paragraph 159 speaks of giving the Secretary of State assistance in respect of recruitment, and the argument ranges around how a body can be charged with the duty of considering additional supply for a profession without having vested in it the right to consider salaries and conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The body responsible hitherto for making recommendations about the supply of teachers and of recruitment to the profession has been the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland. Nobody would suggest that it was debarred from making recommendations which incorporated a new salary structure, or modifications, or adaptations, or additions, to the present system of remuneration for teachers and student teachers. So serious was the position on one occasion that the Secretary of State called for an interim report. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
interim report dealt almost exclusively with remuneration and conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new Council is to have any standing and power, which I hope it will have, and is properly
	<br><blockquote><p>"to consider … such matters … relating to the supply of teachers"</p></blockquote>
we should not emasculate it by taking away from it one of the most important aspects of the supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the fact that the Government have not given it this power mean that there will be another body? Is the Advisory Council on Education to be superseded? Will it no longer function? Will all the numerous Departmental committees be swept away? Will the new Council be the sole body to deal with the supply of teachers? If the answer is "Yes", the only thing which would make it successful in its operations would be to do as the Amendment suggests and allow the Council to consider one of the most important aspects of recruitment. In education debates on other bodies no one has yet favoured the introduction of what is considered to be the most important aspect of teacher supply, namely, the questions of remuneration and conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this important aspect is to be excluded from the considerations of the new Council, which body will deal with it? I should like to think that in due course we shall devise a system to replace the existing Scottish Joint Council for Teachers' Salaries. In England this year there has been a modification of it. The trend is to alter the system. I hope that the new Teaching Council will long be in existence. If it is, it is possible that the present Scottish Joint Council will be swept away or that its functions will be materially altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this argument is accepted, we must anticipate the trend of events, which, in my opinion, points to some alteration in this method of negotiating salaries. There is no more appropriate body to deal with the supply of teachers and make recommendations on their remuneration and conditions of service than the proposed new Council. If the new Council is not to deal with these matters, I do not see how it can seriously tackle the problem
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
of the supply of teachers. It would mean that its field of investigation would be very limited. It could not compare conditions of service in the teaching profession with those in other professions. It could not deal with the question of pensions. It could not do anything, except say we might get more teachers if the standards were lowered. The Council might even recommend that non-graduate teachers should be employed. Everything the Council considers will have to evolve round some aspect of the supply of teachers, which will make it very difficult for the Council to arrive at a genuine conclusion which will have any practical value and which will achieve the purpose of the Council's remit, which is to increase the supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say frankly at this stage that, if there is a Division, I shall not vote for the Amendment. However, I believe that there is an argument here which should be dealt with. After all, we do not all take part in a debate and support an Amendment only because we intend to vote in favour of the Amendment. I hope that we can express a point of view. The purpose surely is to express points of view, not necessarily that each point of view which has been expressed will be carried to a Division. Being on the Government side, I can hope that, if I have not impressed my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, perhaps some private conversations with her will achieve that. There may be no need for the matter to be carried to the length of being voted on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that, if the proposed new Council were given the power to make recommendations on remuneration and conditions of service, it would make outrageous recommendations. Even if it did, there would always be the Secretary of State. The new Council could hardly make a move without it having to be endorsed by the Secretary of State of the day. I believe that the Secretary of State should have courage here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that the Secretary of State for Scotland could be in a difficulty in future if these powers were vested in the new Council. However, I would point out that the Secretary of State might have to say "No" to proposals in relation to the supply of teachers. If he were prepared to say "No" in relation to methods of training and standards of training and make counter-suggestions to the new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
Council, refuse to accept its recommendations, or alter them, equally he should have courage to say "No" on questions of remuneration and conditions of service which he felt that the country could not afford at the time. It would be his job to convince the Council and the teachers why he could not accept the Council's recommendation in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary should give serious consideration to this point and recognise that some other body will have to deal with this question. I do not think that the present setup will last for long. There will be something entirely different. The most appropriate body and one which I think would show considerable restraint and wisdom in making recommendations on these important matters, which are closely connected with the whole question of teacher supply, is the proposed new Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important Amendment. I do not believe that it is possible, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern), for the Clause to be amended so as to introduce some measures along the lines he suggested. This is something which we must be for or against. I cannot see any possible compromise between accepting the Amendment and rejecting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that this was a kind of revolutionary and radical proposal which would change the whole character of the Council. At first sight it may appear that this is so. It may appear that there is a danger of the new Council, given these powers, becoming a new pressure group putting forward yet one more point of view on the whole question of more salaries for the profession. On the other hand, it must be appreciated that any recommendations made by the body, particularly if they were unanimous, as the Council is to be composed not only of teachers but of representatives of all aspects of life connected with the profession, would carry a great deal of weight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been argument as to whether the Wheatley Committee envisaged that the proposed new Council would have powers along these lines. It is clear from its Report that the Wheatley Committee did not recommend this. In fact, it did not even consider it. The reason
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
for that is clear if one remembers the task which the Wheatley Committee was given. It was given a very limited task, as is clear from the first page of its Report. It was charged with the duty of considering the present arrangements for the award and withdrawal of certificates of competency to teach, and to make recommendations on the structure of teacher training colleges. That was a very limited function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already goes further than the Wheatley Committee recommended, because the Clause will require the new Council to consider the question of the supply of teachers. It will be impossible for the new Council to consider the supply of teachers unless it has freeedom to consider the whole question of salaries. This does not mean that we would expect the new Council to become, or would approve of its becoming, another pressure group on salaries. However, we can agree that it will be impossible for the new Council to consider the question of teacher supply, unless it has a degree of freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What type of problems might the new Council have? The only one which the Wheatley Committee envisaged in its Report appears in paragraph 159(1,	<i>i</i>) on page 51 of the Report, where it is suggested that the proposed new Council should be given the power to review the supply of teachers in only one way, namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to give directions to governing bodies for restricting the intake of students in categories where there is likely to be an over-supply of teachers".</p></blockquote>
This is not a problem which the new Council will have to consider in the foreseeable future. I cannot see that there will be any real danger of an over-supply of teachers. The problem will be an acute shortage of teachers, and perhaps an acute shortage in certain grades of the profession, in certain subjects, or in certain areas. I cannot see how the Council will be able to tackle these problems or make recommendations which will be at all helpful, unless it can consider the whole question of salaries and conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Council may take the view that one of the real problems in the supply of teachers is the promotion structure operated by certain authorities.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
How can the Council make recommendations which do not involve considering remuneration or conditions of service? If the Council takes the view that there is a specific shortage of teachers of certain subjects—for instance, that there is an acute shortage of maths or science teachers—how can it make any real recommendations, unless it has regard to the salaries earned by maths and science teachers outside the profession? If the Council takes the view that we are not getting the right quality of graduates from universities into the professions, how can it make any meaningful recommendation, unless it has regard to the question of salaries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the Amendment, not because I want the proposed new Council to be concerned with putting forward the general point of view of teachers on salaries. I want it to be concerned more with points of detail, perhaps with the relationship between salaries paid in different areas and for teaching different subjects covered by the profession—in other words, the type of recommendation which would be meaningful and helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that I think the new Council has very few powers. I believe that we are perhaps misleading ourselves in considering the kind of powers it has. I believe that it will be impossible for the new Council to fulfil meaningfully the new function with which the Clause will charge it, unless it has full powers to make recommendations on conditions of service and salaries. If the Government are not prepared to accept the Amendment, we might as well leave out paragraph 159(1,	<i>b</i>) and let the Council he concerned with the question of considering certificates of competency to teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no compromise on this point. It must be either accepted or rejected. We have to make this choice. It is not possible in this case for the Government to say that they will examine the matter and try to amend the Clause. It must be either included or not included. I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment and give the new Council real power to operate the Clause, because, without this power, I believe that the Clause will be meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our discussions on Clause 2, there appeared to me at least to be a suggestion that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State should not bother about having another look at certain matters which had been raised on that Clause. When a Minister makes a promise to have another look at something between Committee and Report that Minister is bound to do so, and I am glad that my hon. Friend stood by her promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anything justifies a Minister in having another look at a Clause, it is this one. When she was speaking, my hon. Friend said that we already had in existence the Joint Council for Salaries. That body may not be a very powerful body; it may not be doing its job as it ought to do; it may not have sufficient authority; and it may have all sorts of weaknesses which might justify the creation of another body—I do not know, and I make no criticism of it; but at the moment we have an accepted instrument to deal with the question of teachers' salaries, and this Amendment, if accepted, would put that body completely into the shadow. It would leave it functionless. It would have no purpose in continuing to exist. Therefore, the Amendment without saying so, strikes a destructive blow at an accepted and functioning institution in the education world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will have to look at this matter very carefully indeed, because it is the Government who have introduced this phrase into this Clause 3, saying that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be the duty of the Council to consider such matters … relating to the supply of teachers as they think fit"</p></blockquote>
and then, in their wisdom, inserting this exclusion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(other than remuneration or conditions of service)".</p></blockquote>
It has been said on both sides of the Committee, and we as individuals on both sides have been saying, both inside and outside the Committee, that there is no more fundamental issue for the teachers than the questions of salaries and conditions of service. Salary has been their cry for years. Conditions of service, too, have been one of their major sources of complaint. The state of buildings, which in many ways dominate conditions of service, has also been a cause of complaint.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
Now, having said to the Council that it shall be its duty to consider matters relating to the supply of teachers, we say that it shall not consider the two fundamental matters which determine, and on which hinges, the supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say it, but the Government have brought this matter on their own heads, and they have to think of a way out. Therefore, this Clause will require re-examination. But we must look at the instrument to which consideration of the supply of teachers is to be committed and which will have to deal with the two fundamental aspects which condition the supply of teachers; the body which is now in the throes of birth. I refer to the Teaching Council—not, be it noted, the "teachers' council". We must keep that in mind. There is now becoming evident a valid distinction between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council will contain representatives from the county councils in Scotland and from the counties of cities; the big cities will be represented on it. We have with us here, both on this side and on that side of the Committee, former members of Glasgow Corporation. Is there a more cogent issue before the City of Glasgow that the rating problem? Is there a delegate or representative of any of the big cities who will have anything other than a predisposed attitude to the question of remuneration of teachers if it comes up in the Council? The same applies to the counties. They can hardly help taking up an attitude which is almost predetermined. The directors of education, whether they are there in a representative sense or not, will be paid servants of the local authorities and they, too, cannot help being conditioned by that fact. I do not know anything personally about the counties, but they are deeply interested in salaries. The teachers themselves do not deny that the problem of salaries is one of the dominating factors in their consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, it is proposed that we throw this issue into the Council, and the only result will be turn the Council into a Donnybrook. Of course it will. It will take its thoughts and actions completely away from what we have already decided under Clause 2 should be its fundamental duties, standards of education, fitness to teach and training standards. These have already been decided by us to be the fundamental jobs of the Council. On
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
them we could have sensible discussions, naturally, and we could have worthwhile conclusions and advice. But introduce the salaries topic into the Council and one might as well destroy it at birth. It will never properly function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing we must do to prevent that from happening, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) said, is to destroy the Amendment which has been moved by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). This is the first job. The hon. Gentleman is a breeder of trouble, and he knows it. He has flung this problem into our midst with malice aforethought. He has a legal mind, or so we are told. I am not altogether sure what the qualities of a legal mind are, but I know that is has on occasion led to people going to the scaffold or to prison for many years. People have been defended by legal minds but have ended up in gaol; at the end of a rope, or perhaps somewhere else. Yet here it is among us this morning, flourishing as it always does. There is never a legal mind which does not flourish, and the hon. Gentleman is at it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to preserve peace on the Council, and if we are to go ahead with the Bill and have it on the Statute Book, the first thing to do is to defeat the Amendment. Then comes the second task. The argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State was very sound when she said that, if one has one committee doing a job, one should not then bring in another to do the same job. That is irrefutable. But the Government have raised the issue: it is in the Bill. How are we to get the mind of the Council away from that fundamental problem and concentrate its thoughts and activities on the purposes which we have already defined in Clause 2? As I say, this is a problem for the Government, and my hon. Friend will have all the support I can give her in solving it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any hon.

I do not know whether he has embarrassed his hon. Friends by the Amendment, but I notice that he is a real believer in private enterprise. The Amendment stands in his name and no one else's, and it seems to me to go a long way towards sabotaging the legislation which his right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) introduced only last year. It is a year next month since that legislation went through. I did not hear the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West raise his voice at that time, and I am not sure whether he participated in the discussions then, but that was the time for Amendments of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Opposition try to be helpful with some Amendments, but this Amendment—the hon. Gentleman knows it—is coolly calculated to create trouble. I shall be glad to hear from my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; the clear purpose of the Amendment is to take out of the terms of reference the exception which the Bill makes. The hon. Gentleman mentioned this himself. The clear purpose of the Clause is that all matters pertaining to training and contractual relations, other than salaries and conditions of

service, shall be the subject of consideration by the Council. The effect of the Amendment would be to set up a duplicate organisation amongst the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right. No one denies that salaries and conditions of service are important features in the recruitment and supply of teachers, and that staff rooms in schools are the worst recruiting grounds for the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Boll is seeking to do must be considered in the terms of the atmosphere which prevailed during the one-day strike in Glasgow. That strike was not so much over salaries, but over conditions, lack of consultation, and lack of confidence. The principal issue was not that of salaries. The strike was due to a breakdown of communications and a lack of confidence, and the Bill is an attempt to restore confidence and let teachers know that they are not being dictated to and do not have to accept a 	<i>fait accompli</i> on every occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be remembered that it is the Joint Council which negotiates salaries and conditions. The Council which it is proposed to set up under the Bill will consist largely of representatives of the teaching profession. We must, therefore, ask ourselves whether this Council is a proper organisation to consider salaries and negotiate conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances which my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the principal reasons for the Bill is to get the co-operation of the teachers in suggesting ways and means of recruiting to the profession. It is hoped that the Bill will lead to co-operation from the teachers in considering such matters as standards of education, the upgrading of standards, and so on, to facilitate the supply of teachers.

Salaries and conditions of service are, of course, important, but they are dealt with in Section 83(4) of the 1962 Act. Salaries and conditions of service are dealt with by the Scottish Joint Council, which was set up in March, 1964, by the right hon. Member for Argyll. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West wants to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
sabotage that Act. The Scottish Joint Council, which replaced a former National Joint Council, is, of course, having its teething troubles, as it evidenced by the fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had to take some rather sharp action. If the Amendment were accepted, the Secretary of State could be faced with the situation that he had recommendations from the Teaching Council covering aspects of salaries and conditions, and at the same time have a group of specific salary proposals which had been negotiated in the Scottish Joint Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause as it stands is an attempt to give effect to the recommendation in paragraph 152 of the Wheatley Report. I accept what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) that we are not committed to accepting every proposal, every comma, and every phrase in a report, but that we should try to work within the limits of its recommendations. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) rightly quoted the terms of the remit, but he seemed to go away from them, because what he was talking about were the requirements of the service, and the practice, under present arrangements, for the rewarding and withdrawal of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 95 of the Report, which deals with the control and supply of teachers, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But it is obvious that the level of the qualifications demanded at any one time may well be a factor in determining the supply of entrants into training and hence into the profession."</p></blockquote>
It is in those terms that this Council is being set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one wants further evidence of the spirit in which the Wheatley Committee considered these matters one should look at paragraph 150 which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because of the possible effects which its decisions about qualifications and training may have on supply, it is essential that in reaching these decisions the Council should be fully informed on questions of supply."</p></blockquote>
Lastly, paragraph 152 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Part of its functions"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Council's—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be to offer advice and assistance to the Secretary of State at his request: it should also be free to do so on its own initiative."</p></blockquote>
I am glad to note that nobody on the Front Bench opposite supports the
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
Amendment. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West is out on his own in this matter. There seems to be a bit of competition between him and the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) to decide who is the best lawyer. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan pointed out that in every court one side or the other is proved to be wrong. I hope that in this case it is the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on the Amendment, but the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) quoted paragraph 152 of the Wheatley Report. I had intended raising this matter on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, but perhaps in a way it would be more suitable to do so at this moment, because he said that the Wheatley Report stated that the work of the Council would have a direct bearing on the supply of teachers, and it was therefore important that the Council should be fully informed on the supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one reads a little further on in paragraph 152, one notes that it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is, of course, important that its consideration of supply matters should not be confined to recruitment and shortage of existing categories of teachers. The educational system of Scotland is constantly changing and developing, and of necessity its needs must also change. We trust that the Council will be alert to these changing needs and will be ready to take account of them in relation to the qualifications of teachers."</p></blockquote>
For the reasons given by the hon. Lady I do not support the Amendment, but, on the other hand, I think that when we are discussing this question of the scope of the Council's initiative in considering questions of supply we should, ask the hon. Lady to enumerate what was meant by the remark that the Council's consideration should not be confined to recruitment and shortage of existing categories. I think that this has a direct bearing on the anxieties which have been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and I would be grateful if she would enumerate what is meant by this phrase and whether she has taken account of it in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of points to which I must reply, and there has been more than one strand of thought amongst those who have spoken on the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
Perhaps I might deal first with the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir). She referred to paragraph 152 of the Wheatley Report, and I think that she is really asking what kind of supply matters the Council will be thinking of which are other than recruitment and the shortage of existing teachers. The answer can be quite clearly given in the example of the Brunton-type teacher. The Brunton Report was an analysis of the problems of a particular type of child and a particular kind of school setting. The question which the Report posed and answered so effectively was how we could give these children the kind of education which they really need. The answer was that we had to concentrate on a number of subjects on which the children had not necessarily concentrated much before. We must have more craft teachers, more specialised teachers of music, of art, of practical subjects, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perhaps an example of where we need a new category of teacher. Perhaps that it putting it rather strongly, but we need more teachers of a new kind. Thus, the considerations of the Teaching Council would not necessarily be confined to questions relating to the shortage of existing categories of teachers. The Council may want to consider how it can make recommendations to the Secretary of State on how to set about getting more teachers of practical subjects in Brunton-type courses in the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with another strand of thought, some hon. Members asked about our intentions with regard to the Scottish Joint Council on Teachers' Salaries, and whether my right hon. Friend had any plans to make changes here. The answer can be found in HANSARD for 22nd December, when my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) asked my right hon. Friend whether he was proposing
	<br><blockquote><p>"to introduce legislation on the lines of the Remuneration of Teachers Bill"</p></blockquote>
and my right hon. Friend replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not at present."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd December, 1964, Vol. 704, c. 	<i>270].</i></p></blockquote>
There is no intention at present to change the salary negotiating machinery, so the Scottish Joint Council for Teachers' Salaries stays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
In that situation we have the two strands of thinking which have emerged during the debate on the Amendment. One is that there should be two bodies which are able to make recommendations on salary matters. This is the effect of the Amendment which we are considering, and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) effectively dealt with it by analysing some of the difficulties which my right hon. Friend would meet if he had two conflicting recommendations from two different bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is an obvious point, it has been overlooked by some that salaries and conditions of service are essentially matters for negotiation between two sides. The employers and the teachers negotiate on these matters. The Teaching Council will not be composed of two sides in that sense, and it would be wrong to try to include salary negotiations within its remit, if this would have the effect of creating two sides on the Council. We could not consider including in the responsibilities of the Teaching Council consideration of salary questions, which is properly a matter for the Scottish Joint Council. In fact, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill pointed out, the whole procedure is laid down in the 1962 Act. If the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) wants to achieve his object, he would have to amend not this Bill but that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the other strand of thought. I have the greatest respect for the concern and anxiety expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern). They were genuinely concerned that the Clause as drafted might preclude the General Teaching Council from considering any matters relating to general salary positions which it might wish to consider in relation to the supply of teachers. I take their point. Clearly it is necessary to satisfy them, because the Council must be able to consider all aspects of supply. But there is a great deal more in supply than simply the salaries question. Nobody suggests that this is the only, or even the most important, aspect of supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I did not over-emphasise the dangers, but recent history has shown that the salary problem tends to overwhelm other considerations in the minds of the teaching profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would agree, but perhaps for a slightly different reason. Any factors of discontent tend to find their focus in salary problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am sure that the present wording would not preclude the Council from considering and probing all the factors in a particular supply situation, and if it thought that a salary factor was critical in any given supply situation it would be able to puts its analysis to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause deals with recommendations, and recommendations are not necessarily only those which result in regulations being made. It is quite possible, with the Clause as it stands, for the Council to find it within its orbit of responsibility to analyse and comment on general questions affecting the supply of teachers, not excluding general salary questions, but this is not for a moment to say that it will be entitled to enter into any kind of detailed comments in respect of matters which are properly within the province of the Scottish Joint Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever else the Amendment has done it has created a very interesting debate. As far as I can judge it has brought out a certain degree of independence of thought among hon. Members opposite. They seem to regard that as a bad thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How wicked can the hon. Member become!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been called all sorts of things, including a trouble maker. That is a bad thing if it causes hon. Members opposite to have independent thoughts. I have been called a rogue elephant, presumably because a rogue elephant stirs up trouble, and I seem to have stirred up trouble among hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seem to have caused a great deal of trouble to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), who does not seem to realise that we have moved from the conditions which existed in 1789, when one's political opponents were promptly taken off to the lamp posts, and later,
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
when things became more organised, to the scaffold. I am glad that the hon. Member is not Secretary of State for Scotland, or my life would not be worth living for more than a few days. Anyway, we have secured a certain amount of independent thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me more than anything else is that the independence of thought expressed by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) has not persuaded him to have the courage of his convictions and to vote for the Amendment. The Whips opposite are so strong that it does not matter what an hon. Member opposite thinks; he may not vote for his own convictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the admirable example so often set by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) when his Government were in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always had the courage of my convictions, and if they carried me to a vote against my own Whips I have never hesitated to act. I am very disappointed to find that the hon. Member does not have that courage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the hon. Member for Goyan, three-quarters of his extraordinary speech appeared to support my argument, but then, at the end, he looked round and saw his hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) and promptly changed his mind. It is very difficult to follow the logic of the hon. Member for Govan when he changes his mind three-quarters of the way through his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get down to the real meat of the Amendment. We have had a number of references to the Wheatley Report. Until the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) spoke, however, we had no reference to anything except paragraph 159, which did not deal with this question in any detail. Not until the hon. Member for Maryhill spoke were we referred to the paragraphs which really deal with the question, namely, paragraphs 150 to 152.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 152 we find that Lord Wheatley, notwithstanding the narrowness of his terms of reference, dealt with the question by implication, because he did not exclude the matter of salaries and conditions of service. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend also that in addition to receiving recommendations from the joint Committee the Council should keep the whole problem of teacher supply under constant review."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
It is obvious that the whole problem includes the extremely important question of salaries and conditions of service. Lord Wheatley went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Part of its functions should be to offer advice and assistance to the Secretary of State at his request: it should also be free to do so on its own initiative. It is, of course, important that its consideration of supply matters should not be confined to recruitment and shortage of existing categories of teachers. … We trust that the Council will be alert to these changing needs and will be ready to take account of them in relation to the qualifications of teachers."</p></blockquote>
It is clear from that that the Wheatley Committee had this subject very much in mind. If it had considered that the Council should not consider questions of salaries and conditions of service it would have said so, but it did not. My submission is that the Wheatley Committee recommended that the whole question of the supply of teachers should be the concern of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those paragraphs can be read only in the light of the terms of remit. The terms of remit certainly did not suggest anything about salaries and conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member had been here when I started my speech he would have heard me say that despite the narrowness of the terms of reference the Wheatley Committee did deal with the matter, as any independent committee, would have had to do in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what the Clause seeks to do. It seeks to confine and crib the Council in expressing an opinion which is the prerogative of any citizen. There is nothing to prevent me or any other citizen from giving independent thought to the question of teacher supply and writing a letter to the Secretary of State about if. Anybody is entitled to do that—except, if the Bill goes through in its present form, the Teaching Council, which comprises the people who are most intimately connected with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is under a misapprehension about this question. I, am assured that there is nothing in the wording of the Clause to prevent the Council from making to the Secretary of State observations and analyses of the kind the hon. Member has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case it is obvious that the hon. Lady should accept the Amendment and cut out the confining words, because the words which I propose to leave out are exactly those which will crib and confine the Council in performing its duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; there is a difference between a general consideration of the financial aspects of teacher supply and the precise wording "remuneration or conditions of service", which are matters for negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. In her opening speech the hon. Lady spoke of the possibility of this becoming a negotiating body. I never suggested that the Council should become a negotiating body, because it is not; it is an advisory body. She asked what, if we keep the present negotiating body, the Council could do except make nebulous recommendations? But what could be more nebulous than any recommendations of the Council on the supply of teachers if we cut out the most vital aspect of the whole question? Any suggestions which it might make on the supply of teachers would be nebulous without this. I therefore suggest that if these words are retained the Clause is absolutely meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It strikes me that I should give an example of the sort of recommendations the Council should make referring to the supply of teachers and dealing with conditions of service without any way negotiating. As everybody knows, one of the most valuable sources of teachers in Scotland is married women. Much thought has been and still is being given to the question of what would make a return to the teaching profession attractive for married women. It is not entirely a matter of salary. Very often it is a matter of conditions of service. Facilities must be provided to enable these women to return, and I believe that many would be willing to return if conditions were made suitable. This is not a matter of negotiation; it is a matter of thought and recommendation to the powers that be, namely, the Scottish Education Department. If we keep the words in we are cutting off from the Council even the power to consider matters of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all kinds of little pinpricks in the teaching profession. Only the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
other day I had a visit from a lady who had been persuaded to return to teaching for six months. During that six months, because of red tape, superannuation deductions were made, and at the end of the day she had a great deal of trouble in getting them back. These are not negotiable matters but practical matters which are obvious in the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council which we are setting up to represent the profession would be in a position to give a great deal of valuable advice to the Secretary of State on such matters. We should not tie its hands in considering questions and making recommendations of this sort. I hope that even at this late stage the hon. Lady will give thought to all the implications of the Amendment and, if not now, at a later stage, give effect to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman a little by saying that in the examples which he has given there would be nothing to prevent the Council, with the Clause worded as it is, from saying to the Secretary of State, "We have been considering the question of married women teachers and of encouraging their further recruitment, and we find that problems may arise concerning the hours that they work, or the conditions of part-time service. We hope that you will look at this matter." In other words, the Council would be analysing and studying the problem and then saying to the Secretary of State, "Here is a problem which is to do with salaries and conditions of service but which is not for us to look at in detail. We are asking you to ask the Scottish Joint Council to look at the point carefully in order to see what the answers are." There is a distinction between an analysis of a problem and negotiating the answers to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is anxious that the Council should have power to analyse a problem and to state that problem to the Secretary of State. That power is there. The Council is not precluded from doing this at present. What it would not be allowed to do—and I think that the hon. Member recognises this—is to go on to say, "Having analysed the problem we want to suggest that the hourly payment, or the half-day payment, of such and such a teacher—or the superannuation contribution paid—should be such and
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
such." Those are matters for the Scottish Joint Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that as the Clause is now worded the Council is quite entitled to analyse problems and to put those problems to the Secretary of State. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have my hon. Friend's explanation. Would it similarly be open to the Council to say, "We have considered the shortage in the supply of teachers and we feel that it is bound up with, or very largely due to, the fact that the present salary structure is inadequate", and leave it at that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Council can make a recommendation on any part of a problem which it might believe to have a bearing on the recruitment and supply of teachers. This could include a statement, an analysis, of the problems and involve salaries, but not with the detailed recommendations which are properly for the Joint Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have now reached a point at which we are clear as to what is in our minds. I do not know what are the intentions of the hon. and learned Member about his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not clear after what the hon. Lady has just said. I was quite clear at the beginning, but she seems to have contradicted what she said only a few minutes ago. She said quite clearly that it was possible for anybody to make an analysis of a problem and then leave it to the Secretary of State to consider whether the National Joint Council should consider remuneration and conditions of service, but when her hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) asked whether it was possible for the Council to say that in its opinion a certain salary question was what was causing difficulty in the recruitment and supply of teachers she said that it was perfectly possible to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, that would cover remuneration and conditions of service, although I accept that it would not coyer negotiation. However, this Clause refers not to negotiations but to recommendations, and if the hon. Lady says that it is possible for the Council to say that not enough money is being paid to teachers and that it is up to the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
of State to do something about it, or the Joint Council, that would cover what is suggested in the Amendment. I do not think that the hon. Lady was as clear as she was at the start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have two interpretations of what my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) was asking. I did not intend to convey, and did not think that I did, what the noble Lady suggested in the latter part of her remarks. Her first statement of my decision was correct. If my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston was asking whether the Teaching Council would be able to suggest to the Secretary of State that, for example, the Joint Council should be asked to consider some particular salary, or some particular category of teacher, then that would not be regarded as being properly a function of the Council, but if it were to say that it had been considering the problem of the married woman teacher, or the problem of recruitment of teachers for handcraft subjects, and had decided that involved in the problem were questions of salary comparability and questions of conditions of service and that the Secretary of State should ask the Joint Council to consider those problems, then that would be within the Teaching Council's function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether I have now dissatisfied my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston and satisfied the noble Lady, or whether either of them is now unsatisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is doing her best to ride a very difficult horse. Perhaps I may try to clarify the position on one specific issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it should be that the Teaching Council clearly believes that the cause of the problem of the supply of teachers is that the general level of salaries is too low, it could not recommend to the Secretary of State that the salaries of groups of teachers, or all teachers, should be increased by 10 per cent.; but it could say that the salaries of all teachers Were too low; then, if that is what the hon. Lady means, we are in considerable trouble, because if the Joint Council had just negotiated a settlement and the Teaching Council then said, as I think it would be entitled to say, judging from
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
what the hon. Lady has said, that in its view salaries were too low, a difficult position would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the matter on which the hon. Lady must clearly assure the Committee, because it is the nub of the position which we have now reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend made her initial statement, I thought—evidently mistakenly—that she was defining a clear line between the Teaching Council and the Joint Council, which is concerned with salaries and, in my view, therefore with an analysis of a situation precipitating a consideration of salaries, for I cannot understand how one can separate an analysis of the salary position from the power to deal with and recommend salary grades. If I was wrong in my supposition about what my hon. Friend meant, even the modifications which she now seems to be making might lead to future difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask her to do what was requested on Clause 2—to pause and reconsider. I suggest that the Clause should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Council to consider, and make to the Secretary of State from time to time recommendations on, such matters (other than remuneration or conditions of service) as they think fit or as may be referred to them by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That would cut out the reference to the supply of teachers and thus exclude remuneration and conditions of service from the purview of the Teaching Council, confining those matters to the appropriate body, the Joint Council, which was created a year ago. If my hon. Friend thinks that it is worth pondering that suggestion till our next meeting, good and well, but if she rejects it outright, I suppose that she will be able to give me a sound reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give a very sound reason, and it is that whatever criticism my hon. Friend and others may have of the Clause will not be satisfied by the hon. Gentleman's Amendment. We are dealing only with the Amendment, and it will not help us in our consideration of the Clause and must therefore be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), I am quite clear in my own mind about where the balance lies. It would be open to the Teaching Council to make a general observation to the Secretary of State to the effect that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
the general level of salaries was too low to achieve success in recruitment. The Secretary of State would then have the duty of bringing those observations to the attention of the Joint Council, and it would then be for the two sides of the Joint Council to consider them. They would not have to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How could the Teaching Council consider the supply of teachers, a matter of the supply and demand of professional manpower, without taking into account this kind of general background factor? But it would be only a background factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained the matter as clearly as I can and if hon. Members still fail to understand it I suggest that they should carefully consider the 1962 legislation under which the Joint Council was set up. I think that they will soon find that they arrive at a fair understanding of the position. Whatever misunderstandings there may still be, I am quite clear that the Amendment will not assist us to improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely concur with my hon. Friend that to accept the Amendment would be utterly wrong, but when we are deciding where these money matters are to be considered, we have to be very careful. By omitting a reference to remuneration and conditions of service, we mean to say that the Council is not to consider those matters in any way. There is a body already to deal with these specific matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been said about this subject this morning and my hon. Friend must have time to digest it all and to consult her right hon. Friend. I appeal to her to dismiss the Amendment, but to leave the matter there till Report. It would be unfair for the Committee this morning to be pushed into accepting any definition which was not quite clear. My hon. Friend might decide that the Teaching Council should not deal with questions of remuneration or conditions of service, which is my view, but she ought to have proper time to reconsider the matter in the light of what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady was kind enough to invite me to state my intentions about the Amendment. We are now in a completely chaotic situation. The hon. Lady says that the Clause does not mean what it says. She was kind enough to refer to me as "the hon. and learned Member". I make no pretence to be that, but I do have a certain claim to a skill and long experience in the use and understanding of the English language. It seems to me that these words have only one meaning, but they may have some obscure meaning which is not obvious to me although it is to the hon. Lady. She should seek proper legal advice. After all, we have not the advantage of the presence of the learned Lord Advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be grossly unfair of me to put the hon. Lady in the embarrassing position of having to make a firm ruling upon these words without the legal advice to which she, as a responsible Minister of the Crown, is entitled. It would be only fair to her and to the Committee that we should have the benefit of that advice. Purely for that reason, and without in any way withdrawing from my position, it is only fair that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. In view of the decision of the Committee to grant the sponsor of the Amendment leave to withdraw it, would he, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) want to withdraw the allegation of cowardice he hurled at me, or does he want me to hurl it back over to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is too late for the hon. Member to raise this point now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary should withdraw the Clause and reconsider the whole of its drafting. I felt that, at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
start, she gave a clear exposition, which many of us supported, as to why it was important that the National Joint Council should have responsibility for remuneration and negotiation. She then proceeded to contradict herself, and I took particular note of what she said in her last speech. She said that it was possible for the Teaching Council to make recommendations—I quote her words—"that the general level of salaries was too low". I put it to the hon. Lady that this is not advisable. We have a perfectly clear position if we leave remuneration and conditions of service to the National Joint Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imagine, for example, that the National Joint Council has made its recommendations on salaries and then, say two or three weeks later, the General Teaching Council meets and makes observations, which the hon. Lady tells us it is entitled to do, to the Secretary of State that the general level of salaries is too low. That is just the kind of situation which could well result in a national teachers' strike. We have got into a considerable difficulty over the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the Clause and redraft it in whatever manner she thinks makes it absolutely clear for Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, I have two other questions which arise on the Wheatley Report. The first relates to paragraph 151 of the Wheatley Report which says that in the Committee's view it was important, and in fact vital, that the General Teaching Council should have the opportunity to consider the supply of teachers. The Committee said that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"'to effect this we recommend that the Departmental Committee on the Supply of Teachers which is at present appointed by the Secretary of State to review and make forecasts of the supply of teachers, should in future be appointed jointly by the Secretary of State and the Council, reporting directly to both. Such changes in membership of the Council should be made as are required by this change".</p></blockquote>
Will the hon. Lady tell us what the intention of the Government is on the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, can she give us any further information on the question of supply? When the Secretary of State opened the debate at Second Reading, he devoted so much of his speech as to take no less than four columns of HANSARD to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
question of the supply of teachers. He said this, in particular:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have to consider very carefully whether we can find new sources of recruitment … there are proposals now under discussion in the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers and with the teachers' associations. We have not reached the point of decision, but, remembering the time scale, we must realise that this is not something which can be just put off, with the idea that we can let the Teaching Council deal with it. We cannot afford to waste a year. Indeed, in my view, we cannot afford to waste a month if we are to be in a position realistically to deal with the situation in 1970."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee;</i> 2nd February, 1965, c. 13–14.]</p></blockquote>
That speech was made on 2nd February. It is now 18th February. The question was already under consideration. To date we have had no word from the Government of any new ideas as to how to get new sources of recruitment, As we are discussing the supply of teachers and as the Secretary of State said that he did not think he could dare waste a month in coming forward with new proposals to meet the shortage, we are entitled to hear what his latest proposals are or what progress is being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made a reference earlier to the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland and to its practice, when called upon by the Secretary of State to do so, of making recommendations on the shortage of teachers. In making its recommendations that Council dealt definitely and specifically with questions of remuneration and conditions of service. It caused no conflict or difficulty with the National Joint Council. The Advisory Council simply expressed its opinions and did not in any way try to usurp the powers of the National Joint Council or supercede that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I made my earlier remarks, I had no intention of indicating that, as at present constituted, the National Joint Council should have its work interfered with in any way by the Teaching Council. Nevertheless, one can think of dozens of possible situations. For example, the Teaching Council might recommend that graduates should be paid a salary. However, with the inclusion of the words in the Clause.
	<br><blockquote><p>"other than remuneration or conditions of service"</p></blockquote>
the Teaching Council would be completely excluded from making any such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
observation. It might be as well to delete those words so that the Clause would then read
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Council to consider, and make to the Secretary of State from to time recommendations on, such matters as may be referred to them by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is, in connection with the supply of teachers. Then the Secretary of State in his remit to the Council would be able to limit the field he wanted explored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe there would be any danger if the whole question of remuneration and conditions of service were left to the Teaching Council. After all, on the Council there is to be a very strong representation of teachers who have affiliation to the same body which largely represents the teachers view on the National Joint Council. Thus, they would know what was happening on the National Joint Council and would not put forward views in the Teaching Council which would fundamentally conflict with those which would be ultimately expressed in the National Joint Council. If the General Teaching Council were given this power I am sure it would use it wisely and in a very limited way, only if it felt it necessary to tag on to its recommendations some financial consideration or a consideration regarding conditions of service. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to consider all these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that at the end of the day we shall get something which will meet with the approval of the whole Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have, with some difficulty, kept silent to date. I agreed with the Under-Secretary to the extent that I found myself unable to support the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), but at that stage it would have been out of order for me to have expressed the considerable doubts I hold about the Clause. The debate which has gone on for most of the morning has confirmed the view with which I entered the Room. My view at that time was that the supply of teachers as a whole is of such overriding importance in the whole matter of education that, if we were to allow the Clause to go forward as it stands, we should add confusion where there is already an element of confusion. I entered the Room hold-
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
ing this point of view. It has been emphasised pretty emphatically to me for the last hour and a half, because if I was in any way confused when I entered the Room I am certainly a great deal more confused now and I judge that many members of the Committee are equally so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said earlier that, although the inclusion of the words which my hon. Friend sought to delete might not preclude any general matters being discussed, it would exclude some matters in relation to salaries. In other words, we are in the position now where general matters could be reported on by the new Council but not specific matters. If there is any point where it would be difficult to draw a line surely it would be difficult to draw a distinction in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) and myself have spent not hours or days but years considering the question of the supply of teachers. We know that this remit was given, and it may be given again, to the Secretary of State's Advisory Council, but if this body is to function adequately, if the National Joint Council is to function adequately, and if the completely new body on yet another aspect of the supply of teachers to which terms of reference were given only this week, is to function properly—I do not see the value of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 4 "any" precedes "recommendations". In my view, this would ensure that the provisions of Clause 3 in the widest sense exist in another form and render Clause 3 unnecessary. In the light of the confusion, if there can be light in confusion, and because I believe that the Clause does not add in any way to the provisions contained elsewhere in the Bill, I very much hope that the hon. Lady will agree to give fresh consideration to the Clause as it stands and, I hope more effectively, to the possibility of its exclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be thought that I have said quite enough already this morning, but, since the debate began, I have given further thought to what the hon. Lady said particularly on one point which has a bearing on whether the Clause has any meaning at all, that is, her reference to the Brunton type of teacher. I was at first impressed with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
the thought that there might be something in a Clause of this sort from that point of view, but, after careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that anything on the lines she suggested about the Brunton type of teacher or a future new category of that sort is adequately covered by Clause 1. Try how I may, I cannot see that this Clause as drafted has any meaning whatever, and I do not see why the Statute Book should be cluttered up with meaningless Clauses. I am definitely opposed to its standing pant of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As our debates have proceeded it has become clear that the Bill will be of greater and greater importance for education in Scotland. Obviously, the Teaching Council will play a quite fundamental part in the whole structure, perhaps even more important than many of us considered at the beginning. Therefore, a good deal of thought must be given to the different aspects raised in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my part, I can understand the anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). I do not think that he introduced his Amendment in order to display the cunning which my hon. Friend the Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) attributes to him. On the contrary, I am inclined to regard the hon. Gentleman as a fresh and open-hearted convert to the extreme Left of the Labour Party which believes in workers' control. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman putting down Amendments in that sense when we come to deal with the nationalisation of steel, and I hope that we shall have him as an ally on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question before us on this Clause is by no means as simple as was suggested by the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). He said that our decision was perfectly straightforward; one was either for or against. This is not so. There are fine distinctions on the question of remuneration and conditions of service. I agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West that, in as much as the term "remuneration" refers specifically to salaries, there is a salary structure already in existence. But "conditions of service" is a very wide term, and there is matter for argument on the extent to which conditions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
service may properly mean the relationships between teachers and the local authorities. There are conditions of service in the sense of years of service, pension rights, qualifications and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain aspects in this connection should be a function for the Council, while other aspects may not be seen in that way. I think that the answer to the question as regards conditions of service will be clearly seen and understood the moment the Teaching Council begins to operate and examines matters brought before it. I think, therefore, that that point can be left as it is, seeing that conditions of service have this double aspect, part being covered by the Bill, and part being covered by the question of remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest difficulty will arise in this way. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West has made one matter clear. No matter what we decide today, it will be the legal profession which will decide eventually what we have decided. There comes to mind the example that, up to March last year, we thought we had a Scottish joint council working perfectly properly for the past fifteen years, but it was then discovered that we could not only drive a horse and cart through it but we could drive 37,000 teachers of Scotland through it. We were told by a legal judgment that the Act was quite unworkable. Therefore, we must be careful to ensure that the phrases we use are clear. The term "remuneration" could well be susceptible of legal argument. A decision could be taken on a salary question based upon a recommendation as loose as saying that salaries should be increased, and it might then be challenged by one group of teachers. On the question of remuneration in the sense of finalising the different categories of teachers within the structure, we are, I suggest, treading on fairly dangerous ground if we allow the Amendment to go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of salaries, in the last analysis, should be examined and discussed not by a broad Teaching Council but by a teachers' council. A good deal of confusion has arisen already, and the name "teachers' council" has been used quite frequently instead of "Teaching Council". The Teaching Council is not a teachers' council. There is only a small minority of teachers on it. In the Schedule, it is provided that there shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
be 25 teachers, referred to as registered teachers, on the Council, but, when one breaks it down, one finds there are only ten practising teachers on it. It is, in fact, a Council whose task is to look at various aspects of education in relation to teachers, but not from the teachers' point of view. This is most important. It is not a teachers' council in the sense of consisting of representatives of teachers to negotiate the actual remuneration, and this distinction should always be kept in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we allowed the Amendment to go through, we should open the flood-gates of argument because there would be two separate organisations able to decide questions of salary. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West referred to the possibility of a recommendation from the Teaching Council that salaries were too low, the Secretary of State deciding in his wisdom that salaries were too high, and a national strike taking place. What is much more likely is that this kind of argument could arise among the different categories of teachers. I am reminded of the difference between ordinary chess and three-dimensional chess. It is difficult enough to play on 64 squares, but if the board is cubed an almost infinite variety of manoeuvres is opened up. If we have another council able to discuss and make recommendations on salaries, the possibility of manoeuvre both by different categories of teachers and by authorities—and, let us admit, by ourselves as well—would be enormous and the consequences could be extremely bad. We must be most careful about that kind of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the Clause itself be accepted? On the whole, I think that it should be, though perhaps in a slightly different form. There are good reasons why the Teaching Council should look at other matters connected with the supply of teachers in addition to the establishment of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard it said a number of times that the main question of interest for teachers is salaries. I can well remember being at a teachers' conference when a discussion took place on teacher supply, and in that discussion salaries were not mentioned at all. The whole debate was concerned with alternative methods. I see the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) nodding
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
vigorously. He probably remembers it. The entire debate took place on the question of teacher supply without any reference to salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a variety of other questions to be considered in this context, for instance, the supply of married women teachers and conditions of service quite apart from salary, conditions, for example, as are raised by the question whether science teachers can have proper access to research laboratories or units of one kind and another. One can think of terms and conditions of service with reference to timetabling methods involving the grouping of schools and so on. In all these ways, the question of the supply of teachers can be a perfectly proper matter for the Teaching Council, quite distinct from the specific matter of conditions of service in relation to salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is valuable that the Council should not only consider such recommendations as are referred to it by the Secretary of State but should itself initiate recommendations. If the Teaching Council functions as we envisage it will, despite the reservations which I have and which are entertained by a small number of practising teachers, it can become an integral part of the Scottish education scene. But its ambit will be very wide. Its discussion on specific points referred to it by the Secretary of State will develop and, as the field of discussion widens, fresh aspects will come before it on which it can initiate thought. I hope that the Council will, for instance, be able to call before it experts of one kind or another to give evidence, so that its work may extend over many aspects of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question in connection with the supply of teachers is the nature of qualifications for entry. We have never sufficiently considered this in Scotland. I do not know whether the Secretary of State intends to refer this to the Council. If he does not, the Council itself should look at it and get rid of the outmoded idea that adult teachers can be recruited only on the basis of the adolescent type of education based on five O levels, three highers, and so on. We must convince the training colleges of this, and I hope that the Teaching Council, by its influence and authority, will be able to bring pressure on the training colleges and universities and make a recommendation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
in this sense, perhaps to the effect that we might consider accepting essays instead of answers of one sort or another. This would be a perfectly proper part of the functions of the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, there are good reasons why we should stick closely to the form of the Clause as it is, not accepting that questions of remuneration also should come before the Council. Questions of remuneration in the sense of specific, tight and close salary negotiations should not form part of its functions. To do otherwise would be fatal. That is the function of free negotiation, openly conducted, with conclusions openly arrived at. Incidentally, with reference to some of the problems which have arisen in free negotiation recently, and quite apart from the specific argument which has developed between two different teachers' organisations at the present time, it seems to me that it is not only right that teachers should be able to report back to their members but there is a duty on negotiators to report back. Although it seems to me that the way the argument has been presented is a wrong one, I think that the principle involved is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, we should pass the Clause as it stands, or in a form fairly close to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State should take time to consider this matter. The wording of the Clause does not support the interpretation which she puts on it. It seems to me now, as it always has from the time when I first looked at it, that all matters regarding remuneration and conditions of service are outwith the scope of the recommending body, and, for that matter, I do not think that it would be competent, under the last words of the Clause, for the Secretary of State to remit to the Teaching Council questions affecting remuneration and conditions of service. With respect, I think that the hon. Lady ought to take the view of the Law Officers in the matter, as the gloss which she put on the Clause is not supported by the language used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
