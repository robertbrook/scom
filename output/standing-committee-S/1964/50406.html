	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [1st April],</i> In page 2, line 9, leave out "the Board" and insert "them".—	<i>[Mr. Noble.]</i></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. MacMillan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I wonder whether you would kindly clear up two points of procedure, Mr. Steele, at the beginning of the debate. For the benefit of the Committee, I should like you to define clearly the lines of demarcation on which the debate on Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 will be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two Amendments seem to me to seek to insert into the Clause a specific reference to the way in which the Consultative Council shall be appointed. The Clause, however, does not say anything about this. If we want to know how the Consultative Council is to be appointed, we are invited in subsection (3) to look at the provisions contained in Schedule 2. There, we find that the Council shall consist of a Chairman and such other members as the Secretary of State may appoint. I should like, first, to ask how we are to avoid duplication of the arguments which will be adduced when we reach Schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it seems that Amendment No. 16 seeks to alter entirely the scope of the Clause. In fact, far from being an Amendment to the Clause, it seeks to define something which is not dealt with by the Clause. It would appear to be an Amendment to Schedule 2. May I have your guidance on these two points, Mr. Steele?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first place, the Amendment is in order or I should not have called it. Secondly, I hope that the Committee will discuss the Amendments which are now before it on the narrow point of the Amendments: that is to say, who should elect the Council. When we reach Schedule 2, the question of how the Council should be constituted is another matter. If the hon. Member wishes his Amendment to be discussed with the present one, I am prepared to consider that. At this stage, however, I suggest that as his Amendment goes much wider than the present discussion, we should discuss the Amendment which is now before us in the purely narrow sense of who should appoint the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose for a minute or two to round off the points I was making when the Committee rose on Thursday. I was discussing who should create the Council, which involves the manner of establishing it as well as the people concerned in establishing it. I was giving one or two reasons in explaining the importance of the matter and why the Secretary of State and not the Board should create the Council. We have given some of the reasons already and I will not repeat them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that since the Board is not to be territorially representative it is highly important that the Council should be drawn territorially from as wide an area as possible. In other words, there should be as thorough territorial a representation as possible. The people who are most likely to be able to fulfil this requirement are already fairly well known, not to the Board, because the Board, apart from anything else, is not known and is not yet constituted, but to the Secretary of State, to St. Andrew's House and to the local authorities, with whom consultations will take place by the Secretary of State for the purpose of finding suitable people. I therefore maintain that the Board, which does not yet exist and still has to be constituted, is not the right body to decide the people with whom to consult. The job should, therefore, be that of the Secretary of State. At all events, none of the members of the Board—people who still have not been notified that they will be members of the Board—can possibly know all the areas. Therefore, the territorial aspect is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
My next point concerns the interests of the area. This was a legitimate point made by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry); this, I think, was in many ways what the hon. Member was seeking in an early Amendment. The interests and pursuits of people in the area are of great importance in the advice which the Consultative Council will give to the Board. Therefore, a nonexistent Board is scarcely in a position to be able to go to the people now representing those interests and active in them; and the Department and the Secretary of State have far more access and expertise in the matter of approaching and selecting people who are representative of the very narrow interests of the Highlands and Islands. These two points are extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one suggestion to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in passing. It may well be that in spite of what has been said in public, a nucleus of the Consultative Council already exists. It may well be that all these eighteen years of work of the Highland Panel have brought together a tremendous body of information and detailed knowledge of people, places and problems, and to some extent of their solution, because the Panel has made many recommendations over the years of its existence. The Secretary of State or the Minister of State might well think about at least using the Panel as the nucleus of the Consultative Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against making the Council twice or thrice the size of the Panel, because generally we have always found the Panel to be big enough. We should not enlarge it too widely, but each county area and each group of islands—Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles—should have full representation when we talk about territorial representation. The Secretary of State might find to hand a ready-made body of people in existence in the form of the Panel who might well create the nucleus of the Council. The existing Panel, which was appointed by the Secretary of State, is a highly representative body. Parliamentary representation could be included if desired, because the Panel has had experience of this. The conveners of the county councils of the Highlands and Islands are represented and the membership includes also representatives
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
of large burghs and people from both sides of industry, all of whom have been appointed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State is to appoint this body, I doubt whether he needs to go much wider than the Panel in his selection of people for the Consultative Council. This would enable the Secretary of State, as has been the case with the Panel, to bring in technical people from various sources, such as Imperial Chemical Industries and other bodies, and in past years the Scottish Council has provided people with technical knowledge. Perhaps my right hon. Friend will consider this as a short cut to what he is trying to achieve. If he appoints the Consultative Council, at least in the Highland Panel he has a great body of experience and knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the two main points which I have in mind. First, it is much better for the Secretary of State to deal with people whom, to a large extent, he already knows and to draw upon the wide range of people who are able to advise him and whom he is able to consult, in the localities as well as at the centre; and secondly, there should be not only territorial but interest representation on a body of this kind. I strongly suggest that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should appoint the Council, for which purpose he has the means at hand in the form of the Highland Panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the two Amendments would be to transfer the power of appointment of the Consultative Council from the Secretary of State to the Board. I do not know exactly what motivated the Amendments, but they seem to me to have arisen as a result of the opinions expressed by right hon. and hon. Members opposite that the Secretary of State comes into the Bill too often. This seems to be one of the steps which right hon. and hon. Members opposite propose in order to take out the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to get this business of the Secretary of State in perspective. We have already heard a great deal about it during the Committee's proceedings. To get the matter into perspective, I would point out that in the Crofters Act, 1955, the Secretary of State is mentioned no fewer than 111 times
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
and that in the Crofters Act, 1961, he is mentioned no fewer than 61 times. Both those Measures were produced by hon. Members opposite and they have a much smaller purpose than the Bill; the powers involved were much more limited. The Bill mentions the Secretary of State only 55 times. I give these figures to dispel the illusion, which seems to exist on the benches opposite, that we have introduced the Secretary of State far too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the merits of the two Amendments, it seems to me that the purpose of this Council has rather been misunderstood. It is a body which will represent the Highlanders. It will be the vehicle through which their ideas, criticisms and views can be gathered together and given to the Board. There will, of course, be the traffic in the other direction from the Board, which can, and probably will, seek advice from the members of the Consultative Council. It will be a two-way traffic. The aspect which I should like to highlight is that the voice of the Highlanders will be organised and expressed through a body which can and, we hope, will have some influence with the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, it seems to us that the Consultative Council should be independent of the Board. Otherwise, it will be regarded more or less as a tool of the Board. We wish to avoid that. Not only should the Council be independent of the Board, but it must be seen to be independent of it. This is essential if it is to win the confidence of the Highlanders in its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, briefly, is why I cannot accept the Amendments. Their effect would be to destroy the principle which I have explained and to give a quite wrong idea of the function of the Consultative Council. They would not produce the results which we are anxious to produce in the Bill. For these reasons, I cannot accept the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it a little baffling why the Minister of State should call in aid for his argument the Crofters Act, 1955, which is one of several Measures which the hon. Gentleman has repeatedly told us has been a failure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—in the regeneration of the Highlands. We have heard over and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
over again that there has been any amount of legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misrepresent what I have said, either now or in the past. I have never said that the Crofters Commission was a failure. I have always paid tribute to its work. Within its limited sphere it does a good job of work. Nobody denies that. I have never said that it was a failure, but its limitations are far too narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not unreasonable to say that it has often been adduced as an argument in favour of the Bill that previous Measures have not had the success which was envisaged for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, the Minister of State will, I think agree with me that the Bill forms the watershed for the future of the Highlands. If it turns out to be a failure it will be a much greater failure than other Measures of a similar nature. That is why, on the whole, I tend to agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), partly because I feel that we now have a chance of giving the Board what it ought to have, and that is more responsibility. I will go this far with the hon. Gentleman and say that the questions of the kind of people we want on the Council and who is to appoint them depend on what are the activities of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) says that the Secretary of State may tell the Board what action to take of a general character. Subsection (2) says that the Council advises the Board on how it is to carry out its functions. If this is to be the sole function of the Council, I think that it should consist of a group of highly-trained silvery-tongued diplomatists, particularly if the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) were let loose as Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this will not be all that the Consultative Council is required to do. I hope it may be enabled to produce some original ideas—there is nothing in the Bill to prevent that—on which the Board may act, even if it has to get the approval of the Secretary of State for taking that action. If the Council is to be enabled to do this, we shall want some members on it—we do not know how large a body the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
has in mind—of a rather different type from what I would describe as the usual pattern. We shall want some controversial thinkers. With little experience to back up my argument, I would say that such controversial thinkers are not often found among the nominations made by Departments of State. They have the most honourable record for very sound thinking and diligent attendance at meetings to which they are invited, but after that it tends to stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member mentioned controversial thinkers I wonder whether he had in mind a large element of farmers being on the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not think that controversy ever enters into the outlook of farmers. There is one thing on which they all think alike: they are against every Government in power regardless of the political complexion. There is no controversy about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except over the size of the subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) suggested at the last meeting of the Committee that a number of members might not know the area intimately and therefore would not be expected to know the people in the area—the sort of people I have suggested would be useful; but I should have expected the majority of the Board, at any rate, three or four of them, to have a pretty close and intimate idea of the personnel to be found within the Highland areas. I think that members of the Board would have a knowledge of the people in the areas equal to that of the Department of State, and, perhaps, even a little better. That is why I believe that the initiative—I put it no higher than that—in this case would be better left with the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member to turn to column 196 of the OFFICIAL REPORT, in which he will see that I said:
	<br><q><p>"I am not suggesting that we cannot go to the Highlands and Islands and find seven wise and suitable men…."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1st April, 1965, c. 196.]</p></q>
If the hon. Member will read what I said, he will find that I expected that at least
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
a majority of members would be drawn from the Highlands, but not necessarily all of them, and that they would not all intimately know the Highland areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that I have drawn too great an implication, which I should not have done, from those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to endorse some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart). I think it significant that the Secretary of State is to make these appointments. I was interested in what the Minister of State had to say about the functions of the Board. I had not counted up the number of times the name of the Secretary of State appears in crofting legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman would not have complained if he, had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not counted the number of times the name of the Secretary of State appears in this Bill. I do not think that it matters very much. What matters is in what context he is mentioned and the powers which are given. Our complaint is that this power has not been given, or the freedom of action, which such a body of this nature ought to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Consultative Council is an advisory body. It will give advice to the Board. I think there is something to be said for having a series of consultative bodies, perhaps some on an 	<i>ad hoc</i> basis, rather than having one body. The functions of the Highland Development Board are so wide that it is quite clear that, if it is to be equipped to give advice on all the functions with which it is to be entrusted the Consultative Council will have to be a very large body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, it seems to me significant that the Secretary of State is to make these appointments. If the Secretary of State is to be the mainspring of action for controlling the Highland Development Board in the true sense of the term—controlling it in a positive sense under this Clause and in a negative sense under a whole series of other provisions—it is logical that he should appoint the members of the Consultative Council. He more than anyone else knows what he wants the Board to do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
and the type of advice which the Board will need for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is an argument that, in those circumstances, the Board might be left with the discretion of choosing its own Consultative Council, but I think it logical that, if the Secretary of State is the mainspring of action, as he is under the Bill, he is entitled to appoint the members of the consultative body. On the other hand if, as hon. Members on this side of the Committee feel, this Board ought to be left with a wide field of independent action, it would be equally logical that the Board should appoint its own Consultative Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is common practice in respect of similar bodies. I am not certain, but I think that the British Broadcasting Corporation for example, has powers to appoint 	<i>ad hoc</i> consultative bodies to give advice about matters with which the Corporation is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So does this Board. If the hon. and learned Gentleman will look at Schedule 1, paragraph 11, he will see a reference to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 11 states:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Schedule, the Board shall have power to regullate their own procedure and that of any committee appointed by them."</p></q>
With respect, I do not follow the relevance of that intervention. The Council is not a "committee appointed by them". This is not a matter of procedure. The point I am trying to make—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. and learned Gentleman is rather dense. The implication is that the Board can appoint a committee for a specific purpose, if it desires. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent it from doing that. In the running of its work it may well do that. That is why there is a reference to "any committee appointed by them"—	<i>ad hoc</i> committees the hon. and learned Gentleman is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case—we have not yet reached Schedule 1, and it is always difficult when one cannot deal with all these matters at the same time—there is a duplication. I am interested in what the Minister has said, and that will have to be looked into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are dealing with an advisory body. I assume, rightly or wrongly, that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
it is the body destined to give advice to the Board. If Schedule 1, paragraph 11, provides other machinery by which the Board will set up its own advisers on other matters, I visualise that enormous difficulties will arise, but I prefer to leave that till we deal with the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point I wish to make now is that if we have a body with a wide field of independent action, logically it should be in a position and have the power to appoint its own Consultative Council. That is the difference between the two sides of the Committee on this matter. If the Minister is determined that the Secretary of State shall remain the mainspring of action, logically he must stick to his guns and have power to appoint to the Consultative Council. We urge the acceptance of this Amendment because we do not share that view. We take the contrary view, that the Board should have a wider field of independent action and the power to make appointments of this nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the last point made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). There is need for a wider field of independent power. I do not think this the most effective way to achieve it. There appears some confusion in the discussion this morning about the role of the Consultative Council. The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands, probably for the best reasons, emphasised that the prime function of the Consultative Council would be to provide specialist advice. Presumably there would be 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees within the Consultative Council. I do not think it is the intention of the Bill that the Consultative Council shall have that function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This could mean different things. It could mean specialist advice. If we take in functions within the Schedule we see the emphasis on the need for a Consultative Council having representative elements. It would appear to me that the intention of the drafters of the Bill was to create a Consultative Council which was largely representative.

My criticism of the Amendment would be that if we had a Consultative Council appointed by the Board there would be no interaction between the Council and the Board. If we create conditions in which, as the Minister said, the Consultative Council acts as a vehicle of Highland opinion there is bound to be interaction between the Council and the Board. It will be difficult for the Consultative Council as proposed by the Amendment to represent the authentic voice of the Highlands. If one tries to do this, its voice must not be stifled. It is, of course, a different rôle, as I see it, from that envisaged by the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the main argument this morning has resolved around a disagreement or misunderstanding about the precise rôle of the Consultative Council. Whilst it is true, as the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands said, that it is "common practice", to use his words, in other boards—and he quoted the B.B.C.—for them to appoint their own advisory committees, I do not think that this Council is visualised as an advisory body in that sense of the word. I would regard it more as a means whereby people living in the Highlands could have an active method of influencing the Board, in checking it at times, if necessary, and of acting as a sort or go-between between the professional Board and the people who actually live in the area and who will gain or lose according to the success of the Board's work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the remarks of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) I at once agree that the Amendment as it stands is not designed to give, nor did my hon. Friends and I feel that it is a most effective way of giving, the Board extra power. The Amendment—one of a number which I hope the Committee will consider, and I hope that some of them will be accepted—is designed to give the Board something which I believe is necessary to make it effective in the ideas and thinking of the Highlands. I accept that the Council is, in the view of the hon. Member for Inverness, a body which should be really representative, but I suggest that it should be more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highland Panel, of which, had the hon. Gentleman had the good fortune to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
sit in the last Parliament, he would probably have been a member, was a blend and balance of two things. It had its representative side, conveners of county councils and so on, as well as a number of people distinguished either in practice or in ideas in industry and other walks of life. Looking back on its activities over a number of years, it is fair to say that the Highland Panel has at times been a great stimulus to the Secretary of State and at times a thorn in his flesh, because it has found it possible to be active—it has been called "interactive"—between its own activities and the Secretary of State. Although the members of the Highland Panel were appointed by the Secretary of State this did not inhibit them for criticising items which he was, in their view, failing to carry out for the good of the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, therefore, accept the suggestion that if the Board with which we are concerned appoints the Council—in other words, if it is in approximately the same form as the Highland Panel; partly representative of bodies, so to speak, and partly of individual people—that will damp its activities down and will prevent it from criticising the Board's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister quoted the number of times the Secretary of State is mentioned in earlier legislation. He did not, in giving those figures, give the number of Sections, so we cannot work out the batting averages off the cuff. However, the Minister did say that those Acts had not been entirely successful because of their limitations. It is worth remembering that the limitation in those Measures is, in 99·9 per cent. of cases, due to either the Secretary of State or the Treasury, so the Minister was really accepting what lay behind our argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I talked about limitations I meant limitations of purpose and function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that may be so. That may be why we spent six or seven days on Clause 1 of the Crofters Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to remember that this concept of a Development Board for the Highlands and Islands is a completely new type of thinking for the Highlands. At least, I hope it is. If it is a really new idea, based on completely new thinking, why must we fall back again on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
doing the sort of things which, bless its heart, the Scottish Office has done every time before?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept that there should be a two-way traffic between the Consultative Council and the Board. However, it seems to be quite absurd to say that in other cases the Secretary of State had appointed the members of, for example, the Highland Panel, because the Highland Panel reports to the Secretary of State. This Consultative Council will be advising the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seriously believe that it would be of benefit to the Board that it should be in closer touch, after the first year or so, with its Consultative Council than the Council will be in touch with the Secretary of State. After all, its members will have far more information, people living in the area will be giving useful and new ideas, and it is obvious that, if it is found that people are a nuisance on the Consultative Council, not because they are controversial figures in the sense mentioned earlier but because they do not attend or are cantankerous, it will be for the Board to say, "We want to dispense with these people" rather than go to the Secretary of State to ask, "Please will you get rid of Mr. So-and-So?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is every bit as important in the Highlands that the Consultative Council should be seen to be independent of the Secretary of State as it is that it should be seen, as the Minister said, to be independent of the Board, because neither the one nor the other can possibly hope to be always universally acceptable in the Highlands. I would, therefore, rather that it were seen to be independent of the Secretary of State than independent of the Board which, 	<i>ex hypothesi,</i> we are planning and expecting to be the big new agent for doing a number of things which we want done in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>To take a comparison, which is not exactly parallel, we can consider the Scottish Council. In Scotland as a whole the Scottish Council has done more than any other independent body to promote industry throughout the area. Its members are not appointed by the Secretary of State and I believe that they would be worried indeed if it were ever suggested that they should be. They feel that their power and influence in Scotland is in direct proportion to the fact that they are not members of a political body. In the same way, the Highland Development Board will have standing and scope in the Highlands directly in proportion to the way in which it is seen not to be a political body. Therefore, if the members of that Board appoint the members of the Consultative Council, it will strengthen the position of the Council, because nobody will be able to say, "These people were appointed for a narrow political view".</p>
	<p>My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands summed the whole of this argument up clearly when he said that if the Committee wishes it to be seen that it is the Board which is going to have the main function of acting in the Highlands, then it should be allowed to appoint its own Consultative Council. If it is the Secretary of State's intention, however, that he should be seen to be the person behind all this, then he should appoint it. It is because I believe that the former of these steps is right that I urge the Committee to accept the Amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the words "the Board" stand part of the Clause:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 16, Noes 13.</p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> In page 2, line 11, leave out "Highland" and insert "Highlands and Islands".—	<i>[Mr. Malcolm MacMillan.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before parting with the Clause there are one or two questions I wish to put to the Minister about the functions of the Consultative Council. We have been considering the question of how its members will be appointed. This is the moment when we can ask about the general functions of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Minister tell us the occasions when he visualises that the Council will be consulted, what kind of advice is to be sought from it by the Board, what kind of advice the Council will give? And will there be any reason for the Board to take any notice of the advice which it is given by the Council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be remembered that we are talking of a consultative body, and that we presume that nothing that it suggests or recommends will be binding on the Board. I hope the Minister will explain, therefore, the relationship, as he sees it, between the Board and the Council. If the Board appears to be very firm in its view of something, while the Consultative Council—representing the interests mentioned in the Schedule, as well as the geographical areas—also feels strongly in an opposite sense, how does the Minister see that situation being resolved? Has the Council any sanction about pressing its advice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(1,	<i>a</i>) provides that the first duty of the Board will be
	<br><q><p>"to keep under review all matters relating to the economic and social well-being of the Highlands and Islands".</p></q>
Presumably the Council will be asked from time to time for advice on these general functions and will tender it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give an example of the kind of thing which I visualise happening, and I should like to know where the Council would come in. As the Minister of State probably knows, only 10 days ago the Minister of Transport announced a decision to close a railway line in the Highlands, the line from Aviemore to Forres. Further, last Monday the Minister of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
Transport announced that in future he would consult the economic development boards in areas when they have been set up before coming to such decisions. Supposing the same situation arises in about a year's time after the Bill has been enacted, if the Measure were still in the form in which it is now drafted, would this kind of question be considered by the Board and would it be able to obtain advice from the Consultative Council? Would it be a case then of the H.D.C.C, being able to give its views as well as the T.U.C.C, with which we are all so familiar? Following the Minister's Statement last week, it would certainly seem that the development body responsible for this area ought in future to be consulted about such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the Highland Transport Board was consulted about this closure. We do not know what the Board said, because the Minister did not divulge that. How would this situation be dealt with in future? Where would the Highland Transport Board fit in? Presumably it will still be in existence and will give its views. The appropriate local development body—the Minister can tell us which one it is—should be consulted as well, and the Consultative Council should have an opportunity to give its advice on the development aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt hon. Members on both sides will have other examples they can put forward, but in the example I have given one of the main factors is the winter sport development. Unless adequate alternative services are provided, the winter sports development would be adversely affected by the removal of this line. This is the kind of matter which the Board and the Consultative Council would be extremely keen to protect, I should imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister could also at this stage give us information on another matter. I realise that the details of the Council will be discussed on Schedule 2, but could he give us an idea of the number of persons he would expect to see on this body and also give us the Government's views as to the duration of their appointments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister of State consider in due course the point which was involved on an Amendment which fell as a casualty to his rather
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
too ready acceptance of an earlier Amendment? That is what happened in that case on Thursday last, though I blame nobody for it. The point involved, which I now raise on the Question, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill, is that it is very important that it should be seen all the time that the Development Board is the major body and is in control of the situation, at the same time as it is extremely important that the Consultative Council should be, and should appear to be, the authentic voice, as the Minister of State said, of the people of the Highlands and Islands. We have to keep that relationship in balance very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not like to think that the Board is to be what we do not want it to be—under outside pressure day by day in the conduct of its daily operations as an executive body in certain fields and as a Board doing an onerous full-time job. I should not like to feel that the Board was under pressure of unhelpful nagging or under continuous pressure in matters of detail from a very large body advising it all the time. It was, in the Amendment, only a matter of rewording; but the purpose I had in mind was that the Consultative Council's views should always, and quickly, be available to the Board when the Board wants to consult. However, at the same time I would not want the Council to be denied the right to make representations to the Board at any time and to give inspired advice to the Board from time to time. Again, I should not like to think that the Board might have to wait a long time for the results of the deliberations of the Consultative Council or anybody else before it could get on with its urgent day-to-day work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will be a very difficult relationship indeed. I referred earlier to the Highland and Islands Advisory Panel, but that was a different matter. The Panel made recommendations for action direct to the Secretary of State. It was then for the Secretary of State and for Parliament to get on with the job. This situation is rather more difficult, because there are the advisory or consultative body, the Board, and the Minister. There is a three-party arrangement. It will be a correspondingly more difficult balance of relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
I ask the Minister to consider, for the purpose possible rewording at some later stage of our consideration of the Bill, words similar to this—"For the purpose of consultation by the Board in the course of the exercise and performance of their functions". The advisory body would be available for consultation by the Board and it would not necessarily mean that the Board would all the time have to wait for meeting after meeting till the Council reached a conclusion and offered advice to the Board. I am anxious to secure that the Board shall not be hamstrung all the time by too much waiting for advice and by too constant and continuous advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What have the Government in mind in relation to the composition of this body? How often does the Minister of State think that it will meet? It obviously will not be anything like a full-time body. Presumably there will be no full-time member, although just possibly some of the official staff will be full-time. However, the Board itself, on the other hand, will be doing a full-time job. How will the meetings and advice of the Consultative Council be filtered in? This is a very difficult question. It is not easy for us here to visualise the relationship, although the Minister of State will no doubt have thought it out much more fully than the rest of us have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want again to emphasise that, although it is important that the Board should have freedom of action, it is extremely important that the Council should not be, and should not appear to be, the stooge or creation of the Board. The Council should be able to go, not only to the Board, but also to the Secretary of State, if necessary, to make its representations, or, even, protests direct to the Secretary of State—perhaps against some action or inaction by the Board—and thereby to Parliament. It is important that the Consultative Council should be the voice of the local people. I have already given my reasons for saying that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, as I have said, to know what the Minister of State has in mind about the meetings of this body. How often will it meet? What sort of things will it advise on? The Board is to be charged with the task of keeping
	<br><q><p>"under review all matters relating to the economic and social well-being and development of the Highlands and Islands".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
This was more or less the original remit of the Highlands and Islands Advisory Panel, but I am not sure that the remit of the Panel is suitable for the purpose of the Consultative Council in relation to the new Board. We are dealing here with a full-time body, the Development Board, charged by the Secretary of State under his general directions to get on with the job of Highland development, in relation to which there is a mass of information already. I do not think we need to start again amassing a Domesday Book for the Highlands and Islands. A mass of information is already available. A White Paper was presented to the House of Commons in 1950 which was to a large extent based upon information gathered and collated by the Highlands and Islands Advisory Panel. Parts even of that White Paper of 1950 have not yet been implemented. It would have made a great difference if they had been implemented in the spirit of the White Paper. Many of the Highlands and Islands Advisory Panel's other more recent recommendations have not been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Consultative Council will be in a rather different situation. Apparently it is to pump advice to the Board. The difficulty will arise when the Consultative Council makes strong representations to the Board from its detailed local knowledge of the interests of local people and the Board is perhaps unwilling or unable, for one reason or another, to heed that advice. I should like to have a little more of the picture filled in by my hon. Friend the Minister of State so that I shall know exactly what the relationship will be between the Consultative Council and the Board and between the Consultative Council in certain circumstances and the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet decided of what number the Advisory Council will be comprised, but we would expect that there would be 25 or slightly more members. The Council would probably have to be of that size in order to be of the representative character we would wish it to be and also to represent the various local interests. We would expect the term of office of members of the Council to be about three years, or perhaps four years, but certainly three years. We would expect that certain assessors
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
from St. Andrew's House would sit with the Council to advise it in its work, in the same way as assessors attended the meetings of the Highland Advisory Panel, because of the areas and the type of work covered. Therefore, there would be a link between what the Advisory Council was doing and advising and the Secretary of State or St. Andrew's House directly, because St. Andrew's House would know what was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council would report to the Highland Development Board. As I said in my brief remarks earlier, it would be a kind of two-way traffic. We visualise that such a Council would operate in a similar fashion to the Highland Panel. The Panel was very successful in putting forward ideas, schemes and proposals covering the Highland area. That would come up from the members of the Council as a result of their knowledge of the area and their experience of the desires of the people in the area. At the same time, if the Board required advice which it felt that the Consultative Council could usefully give, it would ask the Council for advice on certain matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we must differentiate between advice of a more or less general character and specialist advice. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) ran into one or two difficulties here. If the Board wanted specialist advice on a particular subject or a particular project or of a particular kind, there would be nothing to prevent it from appointing a small 	<i>ad hoc</i> committee to give it that advice. A Board of this character has the power to do this. But that would be of a specialist character and not of the character that we would expect of the Consultative Council. It would be able to get that kind of advice from 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees if it wished to set them up for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in this point. It goes straight back to the Amendment which we moved. Surely there is a genuine difficulty. At the moment the Highland Panel, if there is a particular subject which it wants to study, sets up a small group within itself under the chairmanship of one of its members, and it looks at a specific problem. I have taken part in many such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
groups. But in those days, naturally, we reported back to the Highland Panel. There will be a genuine difficulty here. If the Board wishes to carry out a specific investigation into what is happening to a piece of land or an industry, it may, and I think should, set up a small 	<i>ad hoc</i> committee for the purpose. To whom will the 	<i>ad hoc</i> committee report? If it reports to the Board, the Consultative Council will automatically feel that part of what it believes to be its general function is being performed by someone else, and perhaps it may not see the report at all. In this way the Minister will cause much greater difficulty for the Board and will sow the seeds of what could be tricky complications in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have thought about this a considerable amount, and I cannot see that these difficulties should arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board will want advice on certain matters. Surely, we can take it that the Board will consist of responsible men with some knowledge of this kind of operation and some knowledge of administration generally. Surely they will say that a certain subject is one about which they should consult the Highland Council and that there is no sense in their appointing a committee to do it when they have that other body to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it might be advice of a highly technical character that was wanted. Clearly, such advice would hardly be the sort which one would expect the advisory Council to offer. Consequently, the Board might set up an 	<i>ad hoc</i> committee to give it that specialist advice, and that committee would be responsible for giving the Board that advice. It might be advice about proposals which had in the first place emanated from the Consultative Council, which might have put forward a proposal which the Board thought highly desirable and something at which it should look to see whether it could give effect to it, but in the process it might decide that it would like some rather more technical information on a certain aspect of it, and it would set up a committee to deal with it. That seems to me to be the way in which this would work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not answer the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand from the Minister that the Board would appoint 	<i>ad hoc</i> technical committees? Is that power contained in paragraph 11 of Schedule 1? I think that it is at least a point of view whether the Board has power under Schedule 1. That part of the Schedule deals entirely with meetings and proceedings of the Board. There is no provision that I can see for remuneration for such 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees. I should have thought that if there were to be two types of advisory council—the Council referred to in this Clause 2 and the 	<i>ad hoc</i> advisory committee to which the Minister has referred—there ought to be specific provision for that. However, I do not want to anticipate the argument on Schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probably this would be dealt with in regard to the general powers of the Board under Clause 3, to undertake measures for the purpose of carrying out proposals. This is rather like a business undertaking. I admit that it is rather different in character, but it has many of the features of a business undertaking. Surely, a body which is to carry out a specific project would in the course of events seek advice, specialist advice, scientific advice, perhaps from university people, for certain scientific aspects of what it was doing. One would have thought that all that kind of advice would be sought by a body undertaking work of the character we envisaged the Highland Development Board undertaking. One would expect that the Board would set up an 	<i>ad hoc</i> committee to advise it. That is a different kind of work from that which we envisaged the advisory Council doing. We see the advisory Council operating in a manner very similar to that in which the Highland Panel operated, though rather different in character, rather more representative in character, and also representative of the various interests in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the Highland Board must take notice of advice offered by the Consultative Council. The Consultative Council is in exactly the same position as any other consultative council. Clearly, it must take note of something. That does not mean that it must of necessity implement it. That is fair

enough. We have a number of advisory councils operating, and practically all of them are appointed by Ministers or the Secretary of State. I have a long list here. There are only two which we have discovered which were not appointed by Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Consultative Council will be in the same position as any other consultative council. It will be able to make its reports and recommendations to the Highland Development Board. Clearly, the Board must take notice of such things. It must also be remembered that through its assessors the Secretary of State will also be kept informed about the advice which is being offered to the Board. Clearly, if a situation arose in which the Secretary of State and the Government thought that advice which was being offered ought to be accepted, the Secretary of State has power under the Bill to ensure that it is accepted. One would not visualise that that would happen often, but, at least, that is the position under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell me where that power is to be found?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has power to give general directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be not be a general direction. It would be a specific direction on a certain piece of advice. It would not be covered by subsection (1) of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the Secretary of State could give general directions. Therefore, with regard to advice of a general character, we agree that he could give advice to the Board for it to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would also be in order for the Secretary of State to draw the attention of the Board to something which he thinks merits rather more attention than it is given at the time. One visualises that the relationships between the Secretary of State and the Board will be friendly. One visualises that they will discuss matters. One does not visualise that they will be in separate watertight compartments doing battle one against the other or with the Secretary of State acting as a kind of dictator in an ivory tower. One expects that there will be friendly-relationships and that the Secretary of State will see the chairman of the Board occasionally and talk about the work of the Board, and, therefore, he will be able to draw the attention of the Board to what has been happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of Transport consults the Secretary of State about transport closures, and there is nothing to prevent the Highland Development Board from making representations to the Secretary of State about any closure. In this respect, we intend that the Highland Transport Board should complete its present remit, which was to prepare plans for a coordinated transport service in the Highland area and present them to the Ministry of Transport. This is being done now by the Board, and it will complete that remit, and when it is completed we expect the work of the Highland Transport Board to be taken over by the Highland Development Board, and we then expect the Highland Transport Board to disappear. In the meantime, representations could be made to the Board or the Consultative Council by the Secretary of State or the Minister of Transport.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. With regard to the important question of transport, the hon.

I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will do something about the situation which I mentioned. Ten days ago it was announced that a passenger service in the Highlands was to be closed. That was on 26th March. On 29th March, three days later, the Minister said that the local planning or development bodies would be consulted in future.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bodies are not set up yet, and so they can hardly consider the closing of the line from Aviemore to Forres. They will, of course, have every right—indeed, one would expect the Highland Development Board to do precisely this in future when it is set up—to recommend to the Secretary of State that this should not happen because of proposals which are being made or are in the pipeline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was asked whether we would consider the question of committees. Any body which is set up of the character of the Highland Development Board has implicit within it the power of setting up its own little 	<i>ad hoc</i> committees to advise it on specialist matters. One does not expect an enormous number of these committees to be set up, but we all know that certain matters arise on which a Board of this character requires technical advice. There is nothing unusual if it sets up its own committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) exaggerates the difficulties which are likely. There are always difficulties when a new organisation is set up and in finding out how best it should operate, but I do not think that all the difficulties which have been suggested will arise. However, we will certainly think about the matter before Report, as we have been asked to do, although I think that it will be found that there has been a tendency to exaggerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I make a suggestion as to groupings of Amendments on the Clause.

I suggest first, that the Committee takes together Amendment No. 71, in the name of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), in page 2, line 18, after "the", insert "industrial", and Amendment No, 72, also in the name of the hon. Member for the Western Isles, in line 26, after "the", insert "industrial".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, I suggest, the following Amendments can be taken together: No. 75, in the name of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), in line 20, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>	<i>(b)</i> to consult at regular intervals with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and adjacent areas and with other such bodies as appear to the Board to be appropriate.</p></q>
No. 78, in the name of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston),

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
in line 21, leave out paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> and insert:
	<br><q><p>	<i>(b)</i> after such consultation with the Highlands and Islands Consultative Council, local authorities in the Highlands and Islands and other bodies and persons as appear to the Board to be appropriate, to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State a long-term plan for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands.</p></q>
No. 76 in the name of the right hon. Member for Argyll, in line 21, leave out from "consultation" to "from" in line 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 68, in the name of the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), in line 22, leave out from "other" to "from" in line 23 and insert "appropriate bodies".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 79, in the name of the hon. Member for Inverness, in line 29, leave out "proposals" and insert "plan".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the other Amendments can be taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had time to look at all those Amendments, Mr. Steele, but may I assume that we shall be able to vote separately upon them, if necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 71, in page 2, line 18, after "the", to insert "industrial".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, I am sure, the view of others as well as myself, at least on this side of the Committee, that if the Bill is to mean anything, or anything new and bigger and more significant than previous legislation has meant, it must involve industrial development. Without that, not one of us here would have the least faith that the Bill will have any more value than all the Measures which have passed through Parliament in past years. Therefore, the emphasis upon industrial development, the preparation of industrial schemes and the laying before the Secretary of State of proposals for industrial development are vital if we are to see the effective economic development of the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be asked why, in the Amendments, I am bringing in an industrial as well as economic criterion. The simple reason is that certain things can be defined as economic without being necessarily industrial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And 	<i>vice versa.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>Vice versa</i> is rather different. Agriculture, for example, falls under the definition of "economic", but, on the other hand, "economic" does not necessarily specifically cover either agricultural or industrial. Therefore, we want to include "industrial" in the Bill. More than that, we want it to mean something. Therefore, the second Amendment is the significant one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not disguise what I have in mind and what, I hope, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has in mind. Both the leaders of the Labour Party in recent times, the late Mr. Hugh Gaitskell and the present Prime Minister, have committed themselves and the Labour Party, and to that extent this Government, to measures of industrialisation of the Highlands and Islands, if necessary by direct State action if private enterprise fails. That is something which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State must have in the forefront of his mind and intentions in seeing the Bill implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our trouble in the Highlands and Islands—the Bill would not be before us, if it were not so—is that they have not been sufficiently attractive financially to draw investment from private sources. Indeed, we have great difficulty in drawing investment on a sufficient scale from Government and other public sources. The very absence of basic services throughout the years has kept Highland and Island Members clamouring for roads, electrification, water supply and all the rest which in other areas of the country are taken for granted. Highland and Island Members have to a large extent had to concentrate upon these basic services, at least, short term. It could not be expected that industries could be attracted to areas which have been so lacking in the essential industrial basic services—lacking, indeed, in the essential domestic services until a few years ago and, in some areas, still lacking in things like water supply. There are still whole areas without electricity and without decent roads and communications, and many are, even now, without even a decent water supply. Without these basic services, naturally industry and investment would not flow into the Highlands, and particularly the Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
Therefore, we have in all our legislation so far been thinking in terms of the basic services and primary industry. We have, I hope, reached the position where we now assume that there will be an urgent drive to complete the basic service programmes. It is astonishing to hon. Members who do not know the Highlands and Islands that the crofter counties scheme of roadmaking, which started way back in 1935–36, is still to this day, in 1965, far from complete. There are still areas on the Isle of Barra, in North Uist and, even, on the mainland which have no electricity even if industrialists wanted to go there. There are still areas without sufficient water supply for industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might as well stop thinking in terms of crofting as a viable occupation in itself for the average crofter. Fifty years from now, nobody will set out to be a crofter. Indeed, fifty years ago, and long before that, every crofter whom I have known had long since given up any idea of making his son a crofter. No crofter wants to see his son taking on the problems of the old crofting economy, the old "four acres and a cow" drudgery with poor rewards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem now is the second job in the countryside. Unless the Government can do something to help to provide the second job, a problem which every country has, the small-holding agriculture of the country will fail also in many areas. This has happened in country after country. It has been happening in Australia, in China and in America. It is happening all over the world. There is a drift towards the centres, towards industry and jobs in the towns, and away from the countryside. If in the countryside we wish to maintain a sane distribution of population, we must to some extent bring industry, a second job—the money income—into the areas where crofting or small farming is not in itself a viable proposition. It can never again provide a suitable livelihood by modern standards for the people concerned. There are, I know, a few small farms or, even, crofts in the particularly favoured marginal areas where a number of crofts or small farms have been run together and somebody has specialised in a particular direction in livestock at which he may make a good living. For the average among the thousands of crofters
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
throughout the Highlands and Islands, however, there will not be a full-time job with reasonable livelihood by any means for them or their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be asked whether the people in the area want the Board to tackle this sort of thing and whether they want industrialisation and development. I know from first-hand contact with my constituents and people in the Highlands and Islands that the Highlands and Islands want industrial work very much indeed. They welcome every sign of industrial interest or development in their districts and are all the time on the look-out for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you were able to go again, Mr. Steele—you have been there once before, I remember—to the Island of Lewis, you would find that what everybody is interested in is the other job, the money income job. Crofting takes too much of a person's time for too little reward and the main income must necessarily come from the second job. Unless the Board is to be able to provide that second job, help other agencies to provide it, or provide it itself directly by State action, our policy will fail and Parliament will fail in not ensuring that the Bill has industrial teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no more adaptable communities anywhere upon the face of the earth than those of the Highlands and Islands. My constituents in the Western Isles are at one moment at the other end of the world as deep-sea sailors. Then one meets them at home building a house, having a spell at weaving Harris tweed or, if other work is slack, out building a road for a few months to keep them going till they return to sea, or else they take jobs as mechanics or mill workers. They are highly adaptable, industrially and otherwise, both in agriculture and in industry. Wherever they go, they turn their hand, like others who have emigrated, to all sorts of industrial jobs. They have no difficulty in fitting themselves to whatever work has to be done, industrial or otherwise. They are accustomed also to co-operation because small communities in the Isles have had to co-operate or perish. Men who man small boats at sea, usually without radio and other facilities, have always had to co-operate. People in small Island villages must have a co-operative way of life. It has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
been traditional in the Highlands particularly to co-operate in the management of cattle, sheep and of land and all the rest. There is, therefore, no difficulty about either adaptability to industrial requirements or capacity for co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I raised a matter—perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister of State has not had time to look at it—to which I have not yet had a reply. I refer to the message that went out from his Department, according to 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 27th February this year, in which we were told, apparently with great authority, that Department officials had met the planning and development officers of the Highland county councils and had told them that the Highland Development Board would not take the initiative in the industrial field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a right to expect an answer from the Minister about this. This is far too important a matter to ride over and fail to answer. The statement to which I have referred means that my hon. Friend's Departmental officials met the development officials of the county councils in the Highlands who are affected by the Bill and told them that the Board would not take industrial initiatives. Is that correct or is it incorrect? We have a right to a reply to this before any other question from the Minister today, because I have waited since Second Reading and I have had no word from him. The time has come to get a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same report, it was said that the view conveyed by officers of the Minister's Department to the Highland development officers in the several counties was that the spadework in attracting industry to the area would still be done by the local authorities. It is a fairly desperate future for the Highlands if the amount of industry that we can look forward to being attracted into the Highland and Island areas is only on the scale on which local authorities have been able to attract it in past years. There is no future for the Highlands industrially if we go on at that snail's pace of ineffectiveness. It is extremely important for us to get this point cleared up, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Inverness meeting to which 	<i>The Scotsman</i> refers, it was suggested, according to this report, by representatives from my hon. Friend's Department that it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
might be ten years before real expansion took place. The report specifically refers to industrial expansion. It said, further:
	<br><q><p>"This fits the picture of the Board's functions given to the development officers of the councils. It was indicated to them that the Board would advise, assist and co-ordinate, but not initiate."</p></q>
That was also the impression which Lord Cameron and the Highland and Islands Panel apparently received from the Department. At his Press conference after the Panel's meeting, Lord Cameron said that the Panel apparently had drawn the inference and assumption that the Board was to act as a stimulating and promoting agency and not as a distributor of subsidies and the like, or industrial undertaker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of these statements throughout, especially in what purports to be the official statement reported in 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> is that the Board will not be authorised to take industrial initiatives in the sense of undertaking and itself carrying on industrial activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Board is not to have that power, we can pack up right now. This power and duty may become absolutely essential in an area in which in many parts there is no sign of private industrial interest or private investment of any kind. Far from decreasing, unemployment is growing at the same time as depopulation is growing. In the Highlands and Islands, a desperate state has been reached, in which crofting—in fact the whole smaller-scale agricultural industry—will collapse unless it is buttressed and supported by industrial development and unless the inadequate income of the crofters from agriculture is supplemented by an income from a second job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be visualising the industrial future of the Highlands and Islands, without of any of the mistakes being made which were made in the Industrial Revolution. We have the experience of nearly 200 years on which to draw to enable us to avoid mistakes regarding the industrial development of that area. Territorially, there is ample scope to plan, to build and expand and no need to crowd people together and create industrial slums. The State and private enterprise could work together hand in hand and produce a fine pattern of industrial development. Mistakes have been made in the past in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
some Highland mainland areas with regard to the siting of schemes and communities. Kinlochleven is an older example, especially in the planning of housing schemes. But today we have the advantage of the advice and experience of town and country and planners and planning and there is no reason why any of the mistakes made elsewhere should be made in the Highlands and Islands in respect of industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, then, is an opportunity provided to expand in an area of tremendous territorial scope, itself a great advantage among a diversity of attractions. It would be possible to plan from scratch without any disability except from obstructive private interests that do not want to see industrial development in the area. That is something with which we shall deal in later Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Secretary of State is in a position to do a great deal. He has been quoted by my right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs—for this purpose perhaps I might describe him as the Deputy Prime Minister—as having, during a visit to Scotland recently, made it absolutely clear, that he and no one else was in charge of Scottish Affairs. According to my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Scotland said
	<br><q><p>"I decide these things in Scotland and the Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot tell me what to do."</p></q>
My right hon Friend the First Secretary is reported to have said, in an aside,
	<br><q><p>"I wish we had a Secretary of State for England".</p></q>
It would be a comforting thought that the Secretary of State for Scotland had such powers which would amply cover a number of Amendments on the Notice Paper which I do not propose to discuss now. We have been kicked round enough by many Chancellors of the Exchequer; who have not always expressed as much faith in the powers which the Secretary of State appears to think that he has; or was claiming by proxy to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland does have powers, he has wide powers which are seldom mentioned in such Committees as this. They are wide and deep and, if exercised, could carry a great deal of weight with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with others. They have been written into Statute after
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
Statute and some go back almost beyond the living memory of his office. There is a tremendous scope for the exercise of powers which are virtually of direction, although I do not here use that word in its usual modern industrial sense. If the right hon. Gentleman were willing and determined to exercise them, he would be able to assist in carrying out the policy adumbrated by the late Mr. Hugh Gaitskell and by the present Prime Minister on behalf of the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He could give general directions to the Board, in areas where private enterprise had failed, to bring in new industry. There the State could come in and provide State factories for the benefit of the local people and ultimately, because of the things which would be produced, for the benefit of the nation as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a short time ago there was tremendous excitement in the Highlands and Islands about the possibility of a new university for Inverness. Everyone, including myself and the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) who was then the prospective candidate for the seat, was very excited about this possibility. I hope, Mr. Steele, that I shall not be considered to be out of order in referring to this, because it was not only the prospect of the university as such, however desirable, which caused the excitement, as much as its value in providing an industrial base in the Highlands. I am talking in industrial terms, Mr. Steele. I do not know what advice you may be receiving about this reference, but that is how I am arguing at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We still have not got the university. I am putting this seed into the mind of the Secretary of State for Scotland not only because of the educational, the academic and cultural importance of a university in Inverness, important as that may be, but because it would provide the broad industrial basis around which satellite industries could grow—widely diversed services of the most modern kind, as well as industries of the newest possible type. There could be science-based industries, microbiologically-based industries of the sort which we need in Scotland. We do not want to be confined to the type of industry at Kinlochleven and even pulp mills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital cost per worker at the pulp mill works out, I understand, at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
rather more than £16,000. That is a fairly costly investment for the production of the number of jobs envisaged, although it represents a great deal more in terms of investment and development than only employment in itself. But jobs provided for by modern science-based industries should be able to do much better in job provision at much lower 	<i>per capita</i> cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a fair distribution of light industry and industrial activity, starting, for a change, from the periphery and working towards the centre rather than working out from the centre for the convenience of administrators and planners. We want factories and light industries in the islands and outlying areas where there is the greatest need and the intractable problem of endless unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member whether, in arriving at a figure of £16,000 per job, he has taken into account the people actually employed in the pulp mill, or whether he has also taken into account the ancillary industries created?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring meantime to those in jobs and within the estimated employment at the mill. That, broadly and superficially, is the figure. I am not saying that my figures are accurate. This is the estimated per capita cost of jobs. Let us put it in that way. Something like £10 million of State money is involved, along with £10 million of private money and something like as much again—£20 million—from the local authorities and public spending which will have to be spent on capital expenditure of various kinds—roads and services of all sorts. Of course, the pulp mill operations in turn will spawn a lot of other activities which are very valuable and will ultimately raise employment and, possibly, reduce the per capita present figure. But I think we can take, as a realistic per capita figure, the amount of around £16,000 which I have given taking in all forms of investment. I can only hope that the other things will take place, but on the present potential I think that a figure of £16,000 is not so far out.

Today we need a great diversification of industry in the Highlands and Islands.

We do not ask for Fort William pulp mills or Kinlochlevens in the Outer Islands and in Shetland; we ask for the full development of local industries and creation of new light industries. I do not like to see the shoals of herring which could be caught from Barra westwards going waste through our not having a processing plant provided for the herring industry. I do not like to see the failure to develop the fisheries experiment in the Minch area. That experiment has been highly successful, but I do not want it to be regarded for ever as an experiment. It should go forward now and we should not have to wait for years for consolidation, during which time the new generation of prospective local fishermen will have lost heart. A lot of people are not prepared to wait five or ten years merely to observe an experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to see more done in respect of afforestation and in the utilisation of forest by-products. A great deal of research has been done in this connection here and in other countries. I am not only thinking of the area around Fort William. There are other areas in which this could be done now in respect of local forests, which could still provide a certain amount additionally for Fort William. We should not only plan slowly towards the Islands from places where development from the start is easier. When mainland people go to the Islands and outlying areas they go, as a rule, only to temporary jobs in building and civil engineering, but it is most unlikely that they will stay on in the Islands. On the other hand, when the people from the Islands go to Fort William and elsewhere and they are housed and have started families, they never go back to the Isles. So there is an especially great danger that the Islands may become completely depopulated, even as development on the mainland takes place. The areas which require immediate attention are, therefore, those areas at the periphery of the region.

When the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) made his contribution to industrial development, I listened with amazement. The hon. Member stopped short at a single production, that of a public lavatory in Glenshee. If that is the limit of his ambition in Highland development, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>235</span>
do not expect much support for industrialisation from him. Flushed, as it were—if I may use that word—with his own perspective victory, the hon. Member left the subject. That was the end of his contribution to industrial development. I hope, however, that he will support the Amendment. I hope that he will think of two things, simultaneously, of growth points and also of the danger of some growth points. I hope he will think of the problems of over centralisation of growth points which is in itself a danger to the outlying areas, unless planned development is made to balance this in the Islands and other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fort William must draw from the periphery and as far out as the Islands. It is doing so now, permanently. We all want to see growth points developing but at the same time we want to see localised points of growth in the Islands too. We want that in areas like Lewis and Harris, the Uists and Barra as well as anywhere else. It is too easy to look at Inverness or Fort William only and say that the Highlands and islands are prosperous. It is annoying when, as I have known it to happen, Ministers have gone in the past to Inverness and taken a quick look and then come back and told everyone how prosperous the Highlands and Islands are. They should go to Shetland, or Barra or other parts of the Outer Hebrides where the depopulation problem has reached almost the point of no return. They should go to Lewis where the seasonal unemployment rate is 30 per cent. and one can see people hanging round for months for work, waiting for the chance to take any kind of job and ready to do anything to get employment. It makes one angry when Ministers or others refer to prosperous Inverness as reflecting the standard of general prosperity of the Islands and Highlands. There is a case for priorities for the Islands and for the other areas in the region which suffer most from depopulation and the lack of basic services to attract industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Committee that such areas can and do supply many of their own professional people; that is being done all the time. They come to the cities in the South as doctors, teachers and members of other professions. They go from island and mainland areas to all parts of the world. They have been born
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
and brought up in the areas to which I refer; they are interested in them and long to remain there if only jobs could be provided in which to apply their capacity and skills. The thing that we must have at this stage—and I hope and think it will be provided under the Bill—is priority treatment for those desperate areas. Otherwise, in a few years it will too late and nobody will want to bother with them at all. The people there are themselves saying that now. They know that is a growing official view. Therefore, there is, I repeat, a great risk of depopulation if at this stage all development priority goes to the greater conurbations, the Fort Williams and Invernesses and Kinlochlevens. I do not at all want to offend the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) because he also represents island areas, and it is important to give attention to all places. It is important to develop growth points and to increase them but it is important to create industry and establish new activities in existing communities, so far as that is at all possible and desirable, and to set up little growth points properly distributed instead of having centralisation for the convenience of industrialists or planners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there are these powers and duties in the Bill, with a Board determined to exercise them, in this case under the positive direction of the Secretary of State, the Bill will have very little meaning. I am not saying that it has little potential meaning;—it can be made to have a lot—but perhaps the Minister of State will be able to assure the Committee that this is the intention and that, as we want, he will have it written into the Bill. It is not necessarily the case that the present Minister will be in office for an uninterrupted period in the next long term of years. If that were so, I should be easier in my mind, because he would proceed, I am sure, in the right direction. I pay him that compliment as, I think, would most hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. But times may change. There may come a time when a Tory Government is in power. Then anything, or nothing, could happen. For these reasons I would like to see in the Bill something binding on any future Secretary of State to ensure that industrial development goes ahead. I would rather

see that provided for in the Measure than it being left at the mercy or whim of the political ideologies of any Secretary of State at a later date.

There is a well-known story about the Emperor Francis Joseph, who was shocked to find, on going to a certain Bohemian village, that there was no royal salute. The story came back to me the other day when thinking about Acts of Parliament without sufficient guts in them. It should be remembered that many Bills lack guts until Committee stages, when suggestions are made and real power is often incorporated into Measures. However, on this occasion, when the Emperor was visiting Bohemia, the mayor tried to explain away the lack of a royal salute by saying that there were five reasons why one could not be provided. The first, said the mayor, was that they had no gunpowder. The Emperor said, "Thanks", and sacked him and his companions on the spot. He did not wait to hear the other four reasons, for that first was the most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same thing applies to some development Bills which we discuss. Unless they have power and gunpowder and fire in their bellies, and unless in a case like, this Bill, they have industrial guts, all our talk about development is like the other four excuses on that occasion for not providing a royal salute. It does not matter. Any Bill which lacks these vital ingredients is like any other ineffective instrument. I therefore urge the Minister to accept the Amendment in the spirit in which I am moving it, in the spirit in which my right hon. Friend the late Hugh Gaitskell and the present Prime Minister spoke in Scotland about the need in some areas for direct industrial development by the State where private enterprise has failed. I urge the Minister to remember that a development Bill which is ineffective in respect of promotion and carrying on of industry, if need be by the Board itself, is like that silent royal salute or, in the modern idiom, is like a pub without beer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, if it is a narrow Amendment then I assure you, Mr. Steele, that my words will not range nearly as widely as those of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions I wish to put concern a subject I wished to raise the other day. One is in some difficulty when discussing a Clause to which there are a great many Amendments because one often finds that if one waits till the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, one is precluded from making those points, and finds, so to speak, that one's horse has been shot from under one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which the hon. Member for the Western Isles made about the Secretary of State's phraseology in regard to the powers possessed by him had not gone unseen by me. That phraseology had two interesting results in my mind. The first was to wonder if he was, in fact, the complete dictator which some newspapers, perhaps incorrectly, claimed he said he was and why it was that during the last 24 weeks we had not had any useful big new things for Scotland. The second, and rather minor one, was that his words completely support the Amendments which are down for later discussion and which are designed to remove the Treasury from any need for consultation with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also read that the Secretary of State, speaking about 10 days ago, told the audience at a gala Labour Party do that the plans which he had in mind for the Highlands were of tremendous importance and were going to change the whole picture. Since the Bill is merely a collection of words, it is time, if the Secretary of State really has these big plans—and if he has, I am certain he must have communicated them to the Minister of State—before we go any further and consider the rest of the duties of the Board and the powers in the remainder of the Bill, that the Minister of State should take the Committee into his confidence and say just what these ideas are, particularly in relation to industrial development in the Highlands.

If one looks at the Highland programme over the last 15 or 20 years one sees that there have been large sums of money put behind most of the primary industries. There have been subsidies for agriculture, which some of us consider to be more important than others. Since I see the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) in his place, I am sure he would make an admirable Secretary of State, so I do not know why my hon. Friends should be worried on this score! Forestry, an equally important primary industry, has had a great deal of money put behind it. A fair amount of public money has been spent on supporting the fishing industries, and the hon. Member for the Western Isles made some special points for which I had a great deal of sympathy, particularly in regard to the Minch now that it is a closed sea. Outside those, we have produced a considerable amount of money to build up the infrastructure of things like the Hydro-Electricity Board, things which are intended to bring new life to areas in the Highlands. I shall not go into the details of all this expenditure. Suffice to say that an enormous contribution has been made to the Highlands by the rest of the country in these respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing which the Minister must do when replying to the debate, if he really has been thinking seriously about this problem, is to tell the Committee—not in terms of an absolutely firm target, because I now know how difficult it is to arrive at firm targets—how many jobs it will be necessary to produce in the Highlands in the next 10 or 12 years if we are to hold the present population. I am not talking about going back to the population which existed 20, 50 or 100 years ago. I do not have adequate facilities for working out these statistics, but I would have guessed that it would be reasonable to think that in the next 10 or 12 years we shall need about 25,000 new jobs in the Highlands just to hold the present population. I am sure that the Minister has been working on these figures for some time and will correct me if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the setup of employment in the Highlands the following break down of figures may help the Committee. In the primary industries, in Scotland as a whole 4·3 per cent. of the popula-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
tion is employed. In the Highlands it is 17·3 per cent., four times as much, and the figure of 17·3 per cent. is down by about 3 per cent. compared with 25 years ago. I regret that these figures relate only to 1962. I have been unable to obtain more up to date ones. In the manufacturing industries, in Scotland as a whole 34·5 per cent. of the population is employed, and in the Highlands it is 9·9 per cent. That is 1·5 per cent. down on 1938. Thus we were losing manufacturing industries in the Highlands up to 1962, although I hope that the stimulation which has taken place during the last two years has resulted in the position being improved. However, in any case, it is a tiny percentage. In the construction industries, another important source of employment in the Highlands, in Scotland as a whole 8·4 per cent. of the population is employed. In the Highlands it is 15·7 per cent., again a high figure and representing the amount which has been spent on the infrastructure side; probably more than has been spent on the housing side. On services in general, in Scotland as a whole, 49 per cent. of the population is employed, while for the Highlands the figure is 56·4 per cent. This figure has increased by about 7½ per cent. since 1938.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers these figures in relation to the Amendment which the hon. Member for the Western Isles has moved one see the sort of problem facing the Secretary of State and which faced his predecessors. It is the problem for the solution of which the right hon. Gentleman has said he has great plans afoot. It is certainly true that in the primary industries there is probably not a great deal of scope for extra employment. In agriculture, for example—by far the biggest industry in the Highlands—the whole tendency, despite the large amount of money which the country has put into agriculture to make it viable—and the people in the area we are considering have a heck of a job on their hands to do that—more efficiency results generally mean, in order to make a profit, reducing the number of people employed. The present Government are committed by the policy in this year's Price Review of the amalgamation of smaller units in the agriculture industry. If that is so it is inevitable, whether or not we like it, that fewer people will be employed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
that industry. Thus there is not much hope there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider, next, the Forestry Commission and timber production. That is an industry which has literally been growing during the past 25 to 50 years. However, it is interesting to consider the number of people at present employed by the Forestry Commission. That figure has always seemed to me a comparatively low one, considering the enormous capital expenditure involved in forestry. Even if we are right, and even if the Minister says, as I hope he will, that employment in forestry is to continue, both in the hands of the Forestry Commission and private farmers and landlords, we must realise that even if this goes ahead it will not make much of a dent in the figure of 25,000 extra jobs which we need to see in the Highlands in the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fishing, too, there may be some scope for a slight increase in employment—I hope that there is—as inshore fishing becomes more profitable and as some schemes may be developed for using the vast resources of fish which lie off the western coast of Scotland in particular, and which to date have been only very slightly scatched. Recently the shell fish industry has begun to build up, but I believe that it has much further to go. Then there is the big question mark, which may well turn out to be a winner, of fish farming, which the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) and myself have very much in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the primary industries I cannot believe that on balance there is much scope for doing a great deal to create enough jobs to keep young people at home in the Highlands. If this is so, the Minister of State must tell the Committee frankly how he intends to achieve the sort of things which his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been saying in public, which sound very splendid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The normal average amount of money spent by the Treasury, through the Board of Trade, to attract industrial jobs to Scotland is of the order of £1,300 per job. I do not think it is a secret that if one tries to do the same in the Highlands in most cases one has to pay considerably over the average. The hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
the Western Isles worked out a figure of £16,000 per job for the pulp mill. I would have said that the true figure was probably about half that, but it is still a long way above the average of £1,200 to £1,400. This figure is calculated on the amount of support which the Government give to private enterprise, with private enterprise itself putting up 50 per cent. of the money, and in many cases much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if my figure of about 25,000 jobs is anywhere near correct and they are all to be provided by private enterprise, taking an average of £1,500 per job as being modest and reasonable, this would come to over £37 million just to do that single piece of work over the next 10 years. This, though not an enormous sum, is a considerable amount. This needs matching, at least perhaps more, by private enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister of State accepts the proposal, which is supported by many of his hon. Friends, that this is too big a task for private enterprise, even with considerable State help, he should now give the Committee at least some indication of the type of industries which he thinks the State should set up in the Highlands. This is only fair to the Highlands. He must not say now that he has not had any time to think about it, because there have been many months, and his right hon. Friend has been saying very clearly that he knows what he intends to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is fair to the Highlands. It is also fair to private enterprise operations which may want to start, because there are large areas in the Highlands wide open for development of one sort or another. Private enterprise would rightly feel resentful if, having spent a great deal of money on developing something in an area, the State were to say a month or two later, "We intend to put a State factory down beside you to compete with you".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one has suggested that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not be in the Secretary of State's mind, but as long as he keeps mum, says nothing about what is in his mind, sticks to the words of the Bill, which are no better and no worse than the words of any other Bill, and gives the Committee no idea of what is in his mind, it is very difficult for the Committee and for the Highlands to judge what his intentions are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
At this stage the Minister of State may well feel that he should give—I am certain that he has thought a great deal about it—his ideas on the question of growth points. I know the problem of industrial development and whether an attempt should be made to concentrate it in one or two areas and put all available money behind it and get those few areas to grow, or whether the money should be scattered round with a more liberal hand in the hope that in various places the money so scattered will create more jobs. In the last year or so we have seen, not by particular design, but because of the nature of the area, two things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is the pulp mill at Fort William. This cannot be called a growth point or, indeed, a growth area. It is one industry. We all hope that it will gather round it ancillary industries and the service industries which are directly employed by this plant. At the same time we have seen what looks like being a tourist growth centre in the Aviemore area. This is perhaps more a growth centre conception, because there are a number of different people all doing the same thing in the area. These two between them will probably employ over 5,000 people in total. This is a pleasant additional job potential and covers about two years of the growth we must get every year in the Highlands to hold our population. These are old ideas for which I know the Minister would not dream of trying to take credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What new ideas have the Government for trying to create that number of jobs? Will they try to do it in the industrial field in fairly large units? Will these units be private enterprise or State or a mixture of both? Or will the Government try to get it by creating 1,000 new small industries of 25 people each? These are the sorts of points on which the Board will at least want to know what the Minister's ideas are. I dare say the Minister has none, and will say to the Board, "You think out some ideas quickly, because I have not a clue what you are to do". However, if the words the Secretary of State used at the conference ten or twelve days ago meant anything at all, the Committee should be told what is in the Minister's mind for the increase in employment and development of the Highlands and particularly in industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support what my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said. I was very perturbed when once again he spoke of the article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> which said that there would be no industrial initiative in the Highlands; this statement evidently being made on the authority of some of the advisers of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. If this discussion is to be worth while, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will say something about that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say, in his absence, that I appreciated what the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said, but I thought that his thinking was not big enough. When he said that some of the things that we might be thinking of were too big for the Highlands, I thought that he went entirely off the rails. In my view, nothing is too big for the Highlands. Such talk seems to assume that the Highlands are a separate part of Scotland. They are not. They are Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to look at the Highlands in the same frame of mind as we look at the problem of unemployment in other parts of Scotland and also in England. I draw the Committee's attention to what we are trying to do. We are trying to establish
	<br><q><p>"a Highland Development Board … which shall have the general function of preparing, concerting, promoting, assisting and undertaking measures for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands".</p></q>
By our Amendment we seek to insert the word "industrial".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll wants to know exactly what is proposed. I will give the Committee my own ideas as to the kind of measures which should be proposed for the Highlands. We have two different types of industry. We have the supply industries. We have the breeder or nucleus industries. In my view, the chief trouble in the Highlands springs from the fact that they have mostly supply industries and very few, if any, nucleus industries. There are aluminium, hydroelectricity, agriculture, afforestation, the pulp mill, and the nuclear reactor, which is the only one that could have any claim to belong to the breeder type of industry. This situation has arisen because the Highlands missed the Industrial Revolution. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
have never recovered from that. If we do not think bigger about the Highlands, however, they may miss the scientific revolution through which we are now passing. It is our business to ensure that this misfortune does not befall them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a terrible waste that though some of the finest schools possessed by Scotland are in the Highlands and they educate boys and girls up to the fifth and sixth year, who are sent out with high qualifications in various sciences and in general education, yet there are practically no openings for them in the part of Scotland where they have been educated. This is a tremendous loss. It is part of the depopulation which is continuing, despite the fact that over the years millions of pounds have been devoted to stabilising population, if not increasing it, to prevent this demoralising waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I want to look at what we can do from the point of view of bringing the Highlands into the scientific revolution. I want to look at particular industries. Among the most widely used products today are the polythenes and similar derivatives of petroleum. Polythenes are widely used. Not only is polythene commonly used now. Its use will expand in the future. One has only to look at the fashion changes being advertised now to realise that polythene and its derivatives will meet a bigger market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to turn towards these types of industry—the scientific and the metallurgical—one thing is absolutely essential to progress in their production. That is cheap power. We have a supply industry in the Highlands which can give us cheap power. It has the authority of an Act of Parliament to do so. The Hydro-Electric Board can produce power at cost. It has that sanction. At present the cost of electricity at 0·975d. per kilowatt hour is too dear to attract any of the new scientific industries into the Highlands. While I would not suggest that the power should be sold at cost, I would ask my right hon. Friend to consider reducing the price to 0·5d. per kilowatt hour. If he provided such cheap power he would attract into the Highlands industries based on chemistry and metallurgy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested the polythenes. They are petroleum derivatives. If we are to have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
petroleum, we must bring crude petroleum into the country, and if we are to bring crude petroleum into Scotland for the Highlands, we must have a point at which to take it in. In my view, the point of intake is Cromarty. Thus, in this new industry we would create a great port at Cromarty along with a simple distillation plant for the purpose of refining the crude petroleum to provide derivatives such as polythenes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urea is another product of petroleum with a world-wide use. Compounded with phosphates and sulphates, it produces fertilisers. Natural fertiliser is decreasing all over the world today, with the result that there is not only a tremendous home demand for fertilisers—in the Highlands themselves, in the crofts and farms—but a world-wide demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, there are two points of progress which will give the Highlands confidence and employment for their children and adults which they so badly need in a world which is expanding along all those lines but leaving that part of Scotland completely behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may look at another development since we have been challenged about the type of industries that we are thinking of. I take the metallurgical industry. Here is an outlet for the power which already exists in the Highlands. Electricity is used for the refining of magnesium, nickel, aluminium and copper. One has only to go to any of the modern hotels being built in any part of Scotland to see the enormous part that aluminium is playing in their structure. All that aluminium has been made somewhere. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend can say how much of it has been made at Kinlochleven. I hope that Kinlochleven is sharing to some extent in the production of aluminium which is now being used as fitments in the hotels going up around us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of aluminium in the expanding aircraft industry is another growing outlet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It means more aluminium, and more jobs. I fail to see any reason why new industry should not be created in Scotland to help in bringing a new life and a new future to the Highlands. These are roads of advance. These are new industries which can be brought to the Highlands. I know that a good deal of money may be involved, but along these lines private industry will not withhold its support in working with the Government to try to bring about this development to the Highlands. I say that with a certain amount of authority and assurance. I do not think that there need be unnecessary worry about too big a strain being thrown on Government resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we are all in earnest about what the Bill should do for the Highlands, but I believe that it will not do much more than is now being done if we continue along the present road of expansion. That has been proved. The years behind us have shown that. If it is to provide lasting benefit to the Highlands we must look for new roads of expansion. I have tried to indicate two ways in which we can move ahead to the creation of the kind of Highlands that we want to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
subsection (1,	<i>b</i>), the word "industrial", so that the paragraph would read:
	<br><q><p>"prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for his approval proposals, whether general or specific in character, for the industrial, economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands".</p></q>
A great deal has been said about the importance of the Bill really meaning "industrial". By "industrial" we do not mean merely the continuation of agricultural support or merely the expansion of forestry, although those are things which we want to see. We mean "industry" in the commonly understood sense of the word. If this is not visualised in the Bill, I feel, with the hon. Member for the Western Isles, that the Development Board will fail.

I look forward with great interest to what the Minister has to say in response to the remarks about the article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> to which he referred on Second Reading. I can say from my contact with people, certainly in my constituency, that doubts are being expressed already about whether the Highland Development Board will have the fundamental effect which, at the beginning, everybody hoped it would. That will depend on the degree to which industry becomes a real task of the authority.

I think that, much as the hon. Member for the Western Isles has said, we must look to a redistribution of population and industry through Scotland. That is one of the basic tasks of the Highland Development Board and, I would hope, of the Scottish Economic Planning Committee. I would hope to see further proposals made by the Government as time goes on for the development of other neglected parts of Scotland.

The hon. Member for the Western Isles talked about the second job, the ancillary industry, the need to supplant the existing traditional industries of crofting, fishing and smallholding in the western areas. Equally important to ancillary industry would be the creation of primary industry. I was very interested to hear the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) speak about polythene. Switzerland has shown us how to site small factories very satisfactory so that they blend into the countryside and do not create a Kinlochleven, which the hon. Member for the

Western Isles rightly criticised. Kinlochleven was a type of late Industrial Revolution development, and we must revise our ideas about it.

I do not see the basic difference between making components for Linwood in Birmingham or Inverness—other than that Birmingham is more remote from Linwood than Inverness is. There seems to be a basic approach which says that, if one sets up industry in the north of Scotland, it is too far away from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
market. But I would give the example of A. I. Welders, a firm which has been in Inverness for a very long time and has been able to compete successfully not only in Europe but throughout the world in the construction of heavy machinery—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
