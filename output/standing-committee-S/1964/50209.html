	<p>That if the proceedings on the Education (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's Sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mrs. Hart.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will note that there is a Financial Resolution.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(AMENDMENT OF SCHEDULE 3 TO EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1962.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is very little I can add to what was said at Second Reading. The purpose of the Clause is to provide for the removal of the requirement in the Education (Scotland) Act that there must be a minimum of 10 years' service before there is entitlement of benefits under a widows' and dependants' pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position as laid down in paragraph 20 of Schedule 3 to the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, outlines the provisions which may be made for the payment of pensions for the widows, widowers, children and dependants of teachers. Lines 7 to 12 of the paragraph lay down a requirement of 10 years' service for entitlement to pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the last 18 months a working group of representatives of the Department, local authority associations and the teachers have been considering the details of a possible pensions scheme for the widows and dependants of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The normal pattern in public service pension schemes is to require a minimum of 10 years' service before there can be any entitlement to pension. The work-
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
ing group felt strongly that, with the trend for earlier marriage, a 10-year qualifying period was unduly long for teachers and stressed that there should be amending legislation to permit the payment of pensions for widowed mothers and children where a teacher dies before he has completed 10 years' service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision which may be made for the payment for the widows' and dependants' allowances in the present paragraph 20 enables pensions to be paid if the circumstances of the teacher at his death are one of the following. First, he must be in receipt of or eligible for a pension, given to a normal entrant after 30 years' service; secondly, he must have died in service in such circumstances that, if he had not died, he could have established a claim to a pension on the grounds of infirmity, normally after 10 years' service; or, thirdly, he must have been employed in service for not less than 10 years and have died within such period after ceasing to be employed as may be prescribed in any regulations which are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause amends paragraph 20 of Schedule 3 to the 1962 Act to read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provision may be made for the payment of pensions … for the benefit of the widows or widowers and the children (including children over school age) or other dependants of teachers who die after such date as may be prescribed and who when they die are in receipt of or eligible for an annual allowance or are employed in first class service, or, having been so employed, die within such period or in such circumstances after ceasing to be so employed as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
As amended, paragraph 20 has widened the scope of the provision which can be made by removing for teachers in first class service, which is service in Scotland, and teachers who are, or have been, in first class service, the requirement that they must have had at least 10 years' service before their widows and dependants can be given pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the draft regulations for a widows' and dependants' scheme, which were issued at the beginning of the month, it is proposed that pensions should be paid after at least three years' service to teachers' widows who have an eligible child; that is, a child under the age of 19. The widowed mother's pension will range from £58 to £106 per annum according to the number of years' service of the teacher and the children's pension will vary from £60, where there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
is only one child, to £210 per annum where there are four or more. Removal of the 10-year requirement will also make it possible for dependants' pensions to be paid where the teacher concerned dies after less than 10 years' service and it will be proposed in the draft regulations that these will also be paid after at least three years' service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point arising from the Clause concerns me and I am not sure whether or not my hon. Friend has dealt with it. What would be the position for a teacher's dependants in these circumstances? Would they be covered if the teacher had to retire some time after three years but before 10 years, if he retired through, say, infirmity or some other illness? Is there, in other words, any time limit? I would like to know what would be the position if, although the teacher retired, death did not occur for 15 or 20 years. In such circumstances—if the teacher did not die for, say, 15 years after that infirmity which caused him to retire—would his dependants qualify, or is there a time limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I have understood my hon. Friend aright. If I have, the answer is that they would be covered. If the teacher retired on health grounds he is covered till his child is 19 years old; that is, so long as the child is a dependant child within the terms of the regulations as they will be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, and while not wishing to dispute any of her remarks about the Clause, I am disappointed that she did not comment on a point I raised at Second Reading. I hope, for the sake of the record, that she will make the position clear. I pointed out that paragraph 20 of Schedule 3 to the 1962 Act refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"teachers who die after such date as may be prescribed and who when they die are in receipt of or eligible for an annual allowance or are employed in first class service and are in such circumstances that, if they had not died they could have established a claim to an annual allowance on the grounds of infirmity, or, having been employed for not less than ten years in first class service or in first class service and second class service, die within such period after ceasing to be so employed as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
Clause 1(2) however, states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In accordance with the foregoing subsection, in the first sentence of the said paragraph 20"—</p></blockquote>
from which I have quoted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the words from 'and are in such circumstances' to the end of the sentence there shall be substituted the words 'or, having been so employed, die within such period or in such circumstances after ceasing to be so employed as may be prescribed'."</p></blockquote>
Whereas first class and second class service are referred to in the 1962 Act, in the words which are proposed to be left out, according to my reading of the Bill, the new provision would appear to read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provision may be made for the payment of pensions … to … widows … or other dependants of teachers … who when they die are in receipt of or eligible for an annual allowance or are employed in first class service or, having been so employed, die within such period or in such circumstances after ceasing to be so employed as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
It would appear that the words "having been so employed" apply only to first class service and not to first class service or first class and second class service. I apologise for this rather awkward terminology, but while in Clause 1 (1) the intention is made quite clear, in subsection (2) it is not nearly as clear and, indeed, does not read to give effect to the purpose of subsection (1). I made this point at Second Reading and I had hoped that my hon. Friend would have looked into the matter between then and now. I would be obliged if she would comment on it and make the position clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no other hon. Members have points to raise, I will reply to my hon. Friend. I appreciate that he was concerned about this at Second Reading and I am glad to explain the position to him. He is right in thinking that it could easily be interpreted in the way he has done, but I wish to make it clear that the words "as may be prescribed" will enable teachers who die when in second class service—that is, service in England, which is what we mean by that phrase—to be covered, but they must first of all have been employed in Scotland. In other words, second class service on its own will not be sufficient unless first class service has preceded it—at some point there has been employment in Scotland. In that case, the teacher employed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
in England will be covered on the ground that, at some point, he has been employed in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
