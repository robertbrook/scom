	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [30th March],</i> In page 2, line 5, leave out subsection (1).—	<i>[Mr. G. Campbell.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Steele. Perhaps I might raise with you the position in which we found ourselves on Clause 1 at the end of the last Sitting. I am not trying to criticise or object to your absolute discretion in the question of whether or not the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, should be taken formally, or whether there should be a debate upon it, but I found myself, although I know that I should not have been, considerably surprised by your decision because, in the six or seven years in which I have been a Member of this Committee, that had never in fact happened when I was present, although I am informed that it has happened twice in these seven years, both times under the admirable guidance of an English Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I would like to put to you and on which I would like your guidance—which, I am certain, would help many hon. Members who have not had great experience yet of our work—is that in a debate of this sort, particularly on the question of Clause 1 as a whole, it has been the custom, perhaps, for the Chairman to allow discussion to range fairly widely because it has been our experience that Clause 1 often takes a good deal of time and that the time used during debate on it is often saved on later Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this particular occasion, there were a number of points which I wanted to raise with the Minister which were not directly relevant to any of the Amendments. I thought it right and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
proper to keep those points for the debate on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. I have since found that a number of my hon. Friends had, quite correctly, taken the same course, saving up points which they wished to ask the Minister during debate on that Question on the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would you consider it possible to give the Committee some guidance as to the sort of procedure—I know that there are Standing Orders on the matter—which you feel right and proper for debates of this sort?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What no one in the Committee would want—certainly not I, nor most of my hon. Friends and, I am sure, many hon. Members opposite—is a situation in which, in order to safeguard points we normally raise on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, and which are not directly related to any proposed Amendment, we have to put down probing Amendments, perhaps taking each subsection of each Clause so that one could have a debate on each. That would be time wasting and not of benefit to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I myself feel, as do my hon. Friends who also had points to raise, that perhaps we could be given some guidance as to whether it is possible, on certain occasions, for the Chair to indicate at some stage during discussion on Amendments that it looks likely that all the necessary points have been raised. The Committee would then have some warning that this form of operation would take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee, because a number of new Members have joined us, if I draw attention to Standing Order No. 47, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, during the consideration of a bill in a committee of the whole House, the chairman if of opinion that the principle of a clause or schedule and any matters arising thereon have been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendments proposed thereto, he may, after the last amendment to be selected has been disposed of, state that he is of this opinion and shall then forthwith put the question 'That the clause, (or, the clause as amended) stand part of the bill' …"</p></blockquote>
That is what happened last Tuesday. I used my judgment in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the point put by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) but I cannot at this stage give
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
any Ruling on anything which is likely to take place in the future; I can only deal with things as they come; but I would hope to have the assistance of the Committee in that, when we are dealing with Amendments, hon. Members stick closely to the subject of the Amendments and not have a wide-ranging debate. On Clause 1 we had a very wide-ranging debate in discussing the Amendments and while the right hon. Gentleman says, rightly I think, that he himself had decided to wait till the Question, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill, some of his hon. Friends did not do so. We therefore had a wide-ranging debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the right hon. Gentleman has said and I hope that the Committee will help and assist me by ensuring that the question of having a debate on a Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, is maintained by keeping strictly to the Amendments as they are discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say at once that I have great respect for, and that no one challenges, your discretion Mr. Steele, under Standing Order No. 47, which gives you complete discretion. What I think may cause us some difficulty—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am asking for guidance. All the time I have been in this Committee—eight years—I have known this to occur once, on a Bill last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we have perhaps really dealt with the subject. The fact of the matter is that, because there are a number of new Members of the Committee, I thought it better that I should allow to take place the discussion which has taken place for the guidance of new Members, but I would say to the hon. Member that this is completely out of order because we have now passed on to another Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Steele. May I call your attention to column 144 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of 30th March where there is the laconic statement, "Amendment negatived". The OFFICIAL REPORT does not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
record what actually did happen at that stage. You yourself put to the Committee the Question, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause." That, to the best of my recollection, was carried. Then you put the second half of the Amendment, which was not. Is it not proper that what you actually did do should be recorded rather than this very laconic record of two words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the hon. Member for raising this matter. I would like an opportunity to go into it, and perhaps indicate to the hon. Member what my researches discover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may now, for the convenience of the Committee, indicate the groupings which I suggest with regard to the Amendments before us. After the present Amendment has been disposed of, I suggest that we take Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14 in the name of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble):
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In page 2, line 5, after "may", insert "after consultation with the Board".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 7, after "functions", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to matters appearing to him to concern the public interest".</p></blockquote>
In line 7, leave out "give effect" and insert "have regard".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we will take Amendments Nos. 15 and 16, also in the name of the right hon. Gentleman:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 9, leave out "the Board" and insert "them".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 10, leave out "there shall be constituted" and insert "the Board shall constitute".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other Amendments will stand by themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the cases where we are taking the Amendments together may we, if we so desire, divide on them separately if it is appropriate so to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the attention of the Committee back to the Amendment before us and the situation as it was when we adjourned on Tuesday. The Amendment stands in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) who, as it happened, had just completed venting his spleen on certain hon. Members, had tottered from the Committee and was unfortunately not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
present, as indeed the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) were not present—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I was present, and the hon. Member has no right to say that I was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have misled the Committee and the hon. Member was present I apologise to hon. Gentlemen. However, the task of moving the Amendment fell on the luckless head of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in this because the Amendment seeks to delete subsection (1). I thought that this was perhaps a back bench Amendment and was consequently surprised to find a member of the Opposition Front Bench proposing it. I am surprised if it is official Conservative policy to object to the general supervision of a board of this kind by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member, with his tremendous knowledge of the procedure of the Committee, is being quite remarkably unfair—I dare say intentionally. A good many of my hon. Friends were not aware that the Question, That Clause 1 stand part of the Bill, would be taken formally. I think that the hon. Gentleman, with his tremendous knowledge, probably did know that it would be taken formally. As there were only two or three minutes to go before the adjournment of the Committee, it was perhaps not unnatural that some of my hon. Friends were not here, because they thought that the Question on Clause 1 would be discussed today. The hon. Gentleman is being unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already asked for the help and assistance of the Committee in confining ourselves to Amendments under discussion and I hope that they will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear to me that the vital sentence is that which the Minister of State uttered in reply to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn's proposal on Tuesday. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… this would probably be the only public or nationalised industry for which, if the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
Amendment were accepted, the Minister would not have power to give directions of a general character."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30th March, 1965; c. 147.]</p></blockquote>
While I certainly have grave reservations and doubts about the powers of the Secretary of State and the powers of the Board, it would appear that this is something which will come up for full and proper discussion under Clause 3 when we shall be examining the relative powers, general or specific, but I am surprised to find the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn proposing such a deletion without suggesting any substitution of any kind. I imagine that this is not a probing Amendment because the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has said that probing Amendments are a waste of time. Presumably therefore the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn is not endeavouring to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firstly, quite clearly in establishing regional development there will have to be some form of guidance from the central Government. It would appear to me, particularly in the circumstances of the setup by the present Government—I am not arguing for or against it; I am just talking about the circumstances of setting up the Scottish Economic Planning Committee—that this subsection is only common sense. The real argument will be come to under Clause 3, and I do not think there is anything further I can add to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear to me to be somewhat illogical for the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn to propose this Amendment, at the same time another which I think is a very sensible and reasonable one but which is not in reasonable accord with Amendment No. 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) I want to bring out the point that the words in the subsection with which we are concerned are
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall give effect to any such directions"</p></blockquote>
by the Secretary of State. We want to feel that this Board will confer and discuss amongst themselves and take some initiative, and not spend time being a rubber stamp for the Secretary of State. I hope it does not become like that well-known definition of a committee as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
group of men who individually can do nothing, but who can meet together and decide that nothing can be done. If, as I hope and expect, the Secretary of State will appoint able men to this Committee, we want them to spend their time in constructive thought and not spend the whole time in carrying out directives from the Secretary of State. We want them to use their initiative and to bring together their collective ideas throughout the Highlands, and not just to carry out the Secretary of State's views. For that reason we put down this Amendment, so that we could find out how much time this Board is going to spend carrying out directives from the Secretary of State, rather than using its time more profitably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) has, as usual, shown his tremendous experience of the ways of this Committee, and his tremendous knowledge of Parliamentary procedure and Parliamentary draftsmanship. He has made three points, and the first, with which I feel constrained to deal is his extraordinary point that the Secretary of State would otherwise have no power but for this offending subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from me to give a dissertation on the difference in meaning between "may" and "shall", but all that this subsection says, is that the Secretary of State may do something; and I think the Minister would be the first to agree with me, that in this case "may" means exactly "may", and it does not mean "shall". It is a permissive power to the Secretary of State to give directions, but, of course, the Secretary of State has a permissive power, as does any citizen, to give any directions or any instructions or any advice to anybody he thinks fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why the subsection seems to me to be completely unacceptable is because it imposes upon this Board to be set up an absolute duty to comply with these directions, which is a different thing altogether. So that so far as the permissive power of the Secretary of State to give directions or advice or anything else is concerned, this subsection in itself is completely and utterly unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point which the hon. Member for Inverness made was that this subsection does not give unusual powers to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
the Secretary of State. I suggest that the hon. Member reads the subsection and sees what it does say. It gives the most extraordinary powers to the Secretary of State when read in the context of the Bill, and I will come back to that, but it seems to me that the hon. Member for Inverness had better take himself off to the other side of the Committee, because he seems to find this Bill completely unexceptional in all respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point he makes is that there must be an overall pattern of guidance to this Board. Surely, if he reads the rest of the Bill he will see that there is an overall pattern of guidance or veto or whatever he likes to call it, in that the Secretary of State controls the purse strings, and, obviously, the man who pays the piper calls the tune. So that this subsection is quite unnecessary, no matter what the hon. Member for Inverness thinks about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to turn to the subsection itself. What do we find there? We find not only that the Secretary of State may give directions to this Board, but the subsection goes on to say that these directions will be as to the exercise by the Board of its powers. It seems to me that that means that this Board is to consist of a whole series of puppets of the Secretary of State, that the Secretary of State will pull the strings, and that the Board, like the puppet theatre, will have no initiative at all of its own. It will simply act in accordance with the strings which are pulled by the Secretary of State. There will be no freedom of action and all the actions of this Board in the exercise of its powers will be entirely at the behest of this 	<i>Eminence Grise</i> in the background in St. Andrew's House, the Secretary of State, who is not subject to control, so far as I can see, by anybody. He is not answerable to Parliament for these directions. In fact, the only control by Parliament that I can find in the whole Bill, is in the discussion very much later of the annual report of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection goes on to say that the directions will be as to the performance of the functions of the Board; in other words, the Board will do exactly what it is told. It will be a question of, "You perform in the way that I say, and as I have instructed you". Or else, presumably, the Secretary of State can invoke the extraordinary powers con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
tained in paragraph 4(	<i>d</i>) of the First Schedule which enables him, if he is of the opinion that a member of the Board is
	<br><blockquote><p>"unable or unfit to discharge the functions of a member of the Board, or is unsuitable to continue as a member"</p></blockquote>
of the Board, to terminate his appointment. That is a tremendous power given to the Secretary of State, and I cannot understand how the hon. Member for Inverness can come along here and say that this subsection does not confer any extraordinary powers on the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves what sort of directions the Secretary of State intends to give to this Board, because it seems to me that there is no limit of any sort to the directions which he could give. It seems to me that he could nationalise any industry at all, and that without the specific consent of Parliament, or without even answering to Parliament. It seems to me that the Secretary of State could give a general direction to this Board to nationalise the whisky industry, which, of course, is vital to the whole of the north of Scotland. There seems to be nothing in the Bill anywhere to prevent him from doing that, and it seems to me that if the Secretary of State decided that the whisky industry should be nationalised he would only have to give a general direction to the Board, which under this subsection is bound to carry out that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is much more serious than that. It is not only a question of nationalising the whisky industry in the Highlands, as they could nationalise the whole of the whisky industry and all its appendages in the Lowlands as well. Not only does this Bill at a later stage enable the Board, presumably on the directions of the Secretary of State, to require dismissals, but it gives it compulsory powers to acquire land in Edinburgh, Glasgow, or anywhere else. It seems to me that there is no restriction on the general directions which the Secretary of State could give to the Board. I should like to hear the Minister tell us if these general directions are going to be circumscribed in any way whatever, and what Parliamentary control there is to be on the Secretary of State if he does give directions of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Steele, I was so interested in a letter receievd from one of my constituents, enclosing a newspaper cutting with the information that the wills of three deceased farmers showed £31,000, £15,000 and £9,000, that I was momentarily shocked at their poverty-stricken state. I hope that the Committee will forgive me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we continue to speculate as to what the general directions are, we find ourselves in very deep water indeed. We had an agricultural Price Review the other day, when the Minister of Agriculture indicated that it was Government policy that non-viable farms were an undesirable thing. We are very well aware that in the Highlands there is a great number of non-viable farms, whether we call them non-viable farms or whether we call them crofts. That is a very important part of the way of life of the Highlands, and it may be that the Secretary of State will decide that, in accordance with his own policy or the policy of his Government, these non-viable farms or crofts are undesirable things, and that they should all be bought up and consolidated into larger farms and run either collectively, or by co-operatives, or given out to larger farms. It seems to me that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) should be extremely worried about this, because under the directions of the Secretary of State this Board could do just that, as powers are given to the Board in this Bill to acquire land, but the Bill does not say whether it is feud land, crofter's land or whatever it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out, on this matter of compulsory amalgamation, that my hon. Friends spent many days here trying to prevent the hon. Gentleman's Government from doing exactly this—the amalgamation of crofts by compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, we are discussing on a very narrow debate this particular subsection which empowers the Secretary of State to give directions to this Board, and compels this Board to give effect to the directions of the Secretary of State.

If the Secretary of State decided that these crofts were all to be bought in compulsorily and made into viable units, and run by co-operatives or run under a nationalised industry, or however he decided to do it, then he alone has power to direct this Board to do just that and to acquire the crofts compulsorily. I am perfectly certain that nobody would be more worried than the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles, who would have no power in Parliament or elsewhere effectively to question the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to tell the Committee whether that sort of thing is in his mind, or to what extent he is going to circumscribe the work of this Board in these ways. It seems to me that this subsection is not only completely unnecessary as such, but offers complete freedom to the Secretary of State at his whim to introduce the nationalisation of any industry whatever, in the Highlands, in the whole of Scotland or, indeed, in the whole of the United Kingdom, without any Parliamentary control whatever. I hope that the Minister will reassure us on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that this was a very narrow debate, but he managed to range over the nationalisation of Edinburgh and the whisky industry and various other parts of Scotland, which seemed to me to be rather illogical. I never cease to be surprised at the illogicality of the hon. Gentleman. I thought he had a trained legal mind, but I am bound to say that at times I find difficulty in discovering traces of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, at least it was relevant to the Amendment. I have been rather entertained this morning by the fact that hon. Gentlemen opposite do not know whether they are opposed to what is in the Bill, or whether they are opposed to the Liberal Party. There seems to be a rather touching awareness of the lone Liberal Member in the Committee this morning, and at least it is a change to have some arguments concerning this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked what kind of directions the Board would be given. It would be given directions of a general kind, in order to guide it in the framing of its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
policies, to enable these policies to be framed in accordance with the national interest. This is not unusual, as I said at the last meeting. For every body set up by the Government the Minister is in each case given these powers. If that were not done, then a nationalised industry, a statutory body, could pursue a policy quite contrary to the policy being pursued by a Government, and that would not make sense. Of course, hon. Gentlemen opposite know that. It would not make sense if a body which the Government had set up could pursue a policy quite contrary to the policy which the Government wished to pursue at that time, and that is really the heart of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But has the Secretary of State not got powers under several other Clauses of this Bill to control the Board's actions? Do not its recommendations have to be submitted to him? Does he not also control the purse strings? Is not (that sufficient control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but then, of course, in practice, that would mean that the Board could draw up schemes and, may be, spend a lot of time and energy and a fair amount of money in drawing up plans to be placed before the Secretary of State, which the Secretary of State, because of the national policy at that time, would have to refuse. Surely the Secretary of State should have power to give a general direction in view of the economic circumstances of the country or because of a policy which the Government were pursuing? I would have thought that that made for efficient administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) spoke as if the Secretary of State were some kind of dictator who would go around issuing directives irrespective of everybody. This is absurd, as the Secretary of State is a member of the Government and is responsible to the Government who have to accept responsibility for the Secretary of State. That is the first limitation, and one the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Michael Noble) will know. The Secretary of State cannot do what he likes, as he is responsible to his colleagues in the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
The other limitation is that the Government are responsible to the House of Commons, and in this case the Secretary of State would be responsible to the House of Commons. Are we to take it from what the hon. Member has said that the House of Commons is so ineffective a body that it would let the Secretary of State and the Government pursue every kind of abuse imaginable? I cannot accept this, no matter who the Secretary of State might be. I have some considerable experience of these matters and I do not think this happens. I never cease to be amazed by the hon. Gentleman who shows such an appalling ignorance of how Government works. He complains about the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) because he has been in the House of Commons for only a few months. The hon. Member has been here for five years and still he does not know how Government works. Before he makes another speech he should go to the Library and study the appropriate text books. His speeches might then be rather more valuable, although they are none the less entertaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple issue is whether the Secretary of State should have power to give general directions in order to ensure that the Board for which he is responsible will frame its policies or plans in accordance with the Government policy or national policy. It is necessary that the Secretary of State should have precisely these powers. I am amazed at the sudden reforming zeal of hon. Members opposite who are coming along with propositions now which, quite rightly, they did not tolerate for thirteen years. On reflection they will agree that the Secretary of State should be enabled to do his job and properly fulfil his obligations to the House of Commons and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support this Amendment for various reasons, primarily because the powers given in this subsection will hamstring the Board from the word "go". Going on that line of ham, the Board will, I suggest, be like a ham sandwich: on top will be the Secretary of State giving firm directions, and underneath, as it were, there will be the Advisory Council. In other words there will be directions from the top and advice from the bottom. I think this would be a grave disadvantage,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
because hon. Members of all parties are agreed that we must have the right men on the Board but we will not get them if they see they will have little power and room to manœuvre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the powers of the Board were not unusual and were based on other Acts of Parliament, but the Airways Corporations Act, says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each of the Corporations shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have power to provide air transport services and to carry out all other forms of aerial work …"</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… to exercise those powers so as to secure that the air services"</p></blockquote>
are provided by the Corporations at reasonable charges. Likewise when the National Coal Board was set up the Act stated that the functions of the Board
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include the carrying on of all such activities as it may appear to the Board to be requisite …"</p></blockquote>
That is the very reverse—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member must know from its history that the National Coal Board has been subject to Government direction for years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so, but my point is that it has been necessary to change certain things. I am comparing the Bill with previous Measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we let this subsection go through we are going to start off at half cock and we are not going to get the best men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will go off at full cock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we will go off at half cock. The Minister said that the Board must be subject to Government control from day to day. That may be fair from his point of view, but this means it will be a shuttlecock which pops to and fro. I do not know how long the present Government will stay in office but we on this side are not satisfied with the Bill as it is and if we do not get Amendments we shall take action to make the Bill more workable when we return to power. The way to get agreement on this Clause is to leave out subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first real contribution to these debates and I have no inclination to delay the Committee. The Highlands definitely want this Bill as quickly as possible and they want us

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
to get on with the job. These feelings have been expressed to me in many letters from friends in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, when we get the sort of debate we have had this morning it behoves anyone who is interested in the Highlands and desires some betterment for the Highland population to try to burst some of the balloons which are being thrown about by allegedly responsible Members of Parliament reflecting the views of constituencies, some of them in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) is labouring under a misapprehension when he talks about the Air Corporations and the Coal Board and reads out little snippets from their constitutions. Over and above all of them the Minister responsible in Parliament is free to give directions at any time no matter what party is in Government. This is what we are doing in this Clause. Hon. Members opposite want to remove these overall political directions because there is a Labour Government who have decided upon a new policy for the Highlands. The Secretary of State must have power to see that policy is carried out by whatever instrument he sets up and no matter how much niggling we get from the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is constantly surprised by the antics of the hon. Member. Sometimes I like his antics but on other occasions they rather get under my skin. Today he is playing a game and is not concerned with the Highlands but is filibustering because that gives him a little enjoyment. I deplore the fact that he is being aided by the Opposition Front Bench. I presume hon. Members opposite are going to test this by a Division, or is it merely all hot air and synthetic? This Amendment was moved from the Front Bench because all the supporters of it had run away as they thought the meeting had finished. The Opposition Front Bench Members deliberately did not put their names to the Amendment but they are aiding it by moving it. We must get this clear and I trust that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) will tell us where the Front Bench stands. His colleagues have flown and a great responsibility falls on his shoulders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
The hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) bemoans the fact that the Secretary of State is to have this power in the Highlands but if the Bill had included Bute he would have warmly welcomed it. Letters are already appearing in local newspapers asking the Committee to hurry its consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a lot of hot air in our discussions. We are not doing the job of analysing and improving the Bill in order to see that it is an effective instrument able to carry out the job we intend it to do. The Highland counties almost unanimously want these powers and want the general directions based upon political decisions. We are going to revive the economic life of the Highlands in a way that has not been done for thirteen years during which there has been nothing but disappointment. There has been a feeling that it was not worth hanging on. If the Amendment were carried, it would be a bad thing for the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), I am concerned that as much as possible should be done for the Highlands. As he said, I am concerned that the County of Bute should be included in that definition. I am also concerned that it should be done in the right way, and I made that clear last week when I urged that Bute should be included within the terms of the Bill. I said that what I wanted was that these benefits should be extended to Bute, provided that they were benefits and that we were satisfied with the Bill when it reached the Statute Book. We hoped that the Government would meet our objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not become the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire to talk about hot air. He is one of the most articulate of an extremely articulate group and, he has shown it over the years. He can have no objection to our asking that certain, what might appear to be controversial, powers to be given to the Secretary of State should be carefully scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friends, I am concerned with the potential dangers of these provisions. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) talked about the danger of a superman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disturb the hon. Gentleman in his correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will get some of this "correspondence" later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we are all concerned about. I do not say that the present incumbent of the office shows many signs of being a superman, but one never knows. The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) might become Secretary of State and then we should see something. For all these reasons, we want carefully to consider this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) used a very good simile about a hamstrung ham sandwich, or hamstrung ham in ham sandwiches. To be hamstrung ham in a ham sandwich is something which no reputable board would want to be. The members of this Board, whose talents and experience I am as anxious to see lavished on the Highlands as is the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire, will find themselves in a cross-fire. This Clause provides that the Secretary of State may give them directions of a general character, but the fact that their character is general does not imply that they need to be any the less drastic, and they may be all the more drastic, as to both the exercise and performance of the functions. I am not sure what the distinction between "exercise" and "performance" is. It may be just verbiage, but, on the contrary, it may be a means of tying down the Board still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and this is certainly not permissive—the Secretary of State has permissive powers and may do anything he likes—the Board
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall give effect to any such direction".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that he accepted this principle when on Clause 1 he said that he wanted the County of Bute to be included? Clause 1 says that if the Secretary of State gives a direction it shall be by means of a Statutory Instrument put before Parliament. The Board cannot do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were told, quite rightly, that in our discussion of Clause 1 it would be out of order to discuss the wider implications of the Bill. I am naturally anxious that the Secretary of State, not necessarily this Secretary of State, but my right hon. Friend in due course, should be given powers to make the Bill work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to this sandwich. The trouble is that on the one hand the Board will be told what to do, what recommendations it shall make, and on the other hand it has to submit those same recommendations and proposals back to the Secretary of State. This is all very fine, but I do not see why the Secretary of State could not do exactly the same thing, not with men of experience and talent knowing all about the Highlands, but with the perfectly competent civil servants, over whom he already has considerable power, in St. Andrew's House. I do not see the need to have a Bill in which the Secretary of State is mentioned 55 times and which makes him a superman, which the hon. Member for the Western Isles does not like, manipulating proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that he will be a superman, but he may become a superman. In the hands of some Secretaries of State, if not this, this could be a very dangerous Bill. Naturally, the Secretary of State must have some powers, but so must the Board, or we shall not get the people we want and the Board will not serve the useful purpose which we hope it will serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene very briefly to direct the Committee's attention to what has been the resolution of a very old problem. It has now been accepted throughout the entire argument that the Secretary of State may give directions and that "may" is permissive. He may or he may not. When the directions reach the Board, the Board "shall" give effect to them, and "shall" is imperative. We have now concluded, after many moons, the argument about "may" and "shall" and agreed that there is no interchanging of one for the other; that their meanings and applications are different. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has acceped that "may" means something different from "shall" and cannot be used in place of "shall" and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
that "shall" cannot be used in place of "may".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman making exactly the point which I have tried to make, which is that, whereas the Secretary of State may, if he chooses, give directions to the Board, and there is nothing to stop him, there is no question but that the Board "shall" give effect to any such directions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been referred to in this discussion several times; but I cannot see why I should have been accused by the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire of doing my correspondence while he was speaking. In fact, I was taking notes of the speech of the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean), as I always respectfully do when he contributes to the Committee's discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we may as well start being frank with each other. Both Front Benches must be well aware of what the "Mother" of this Bill is to a large extent. We know that the Bill is largely based on the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts from 1948—ground nuts—straight through to 1959. The Amendments being moved are straight out of those Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act of 1959, the latest, was produced by a Government in which the predecessor of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was Secretary of State for Scotland. They produced and blessed the working which is now proposed in this Bill, and yet hon. Members opposite are now arguing powerfully against something which they themselves approved and inserted and insisted upon writing into the draft and the actual final wording of the Overseas Resources Development Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant sections of the 1959 edition of those Acts largely correspond with the appropriate Clauses of the Bill and there is very little that hon. Members opposite can say to criticise the present Government without criticising themselves for having set the precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the wording of that Act relating to the powers of the Secretary of State—it comes under a slightly different heading actually as, "Powers of the Secretary of State" is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Corporation"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
that phrase is the origin of one of the first Amendments before us here—
	<br><blockquote><p>"give to it directions of general character as to the exercise and performance of its functions in relation to matters appearing to him to concern the public interest"—</p></blockquote>
another Amendment today from hon. Members opposite uses almost these very words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the Corporation shall give effect"—</p></blockquote>
another Amendment from across the floor is based on these words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to any such directions"</p></blockquote>
I wish that hon. Members opposite would not be quite so self-righteous about redrafting the phrasing of the Bill now before us. They themselves produced a Bill and forced it through—they did not need to force it through, because it was generally agreed—put it through, containing exactly these provisions in almost identical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand this sort of humbug. We have already had quite a lot of humbug on earlier Amendments. A certain amount of harmless humbug is allowed, like reasonable exaggeration in advertising, but we should not have as much as we have had from the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and certain others today and on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In later Amendments, by contrast with his arguments this morning, the right hon. Member for Argyll wants to extend and strengthen the powers of the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 23 in Clause 4, page 3, line 9, is concerned with the ensuring approval of the Secretary of State. In Amendment No. 89, in Clause 4, page 3, line 25, the right hon. Gentleman suggests that the Secretary of State should interfere more and should give directions to the Board as to the disposal of land. Of course, in that instance we are on a very tender Tory spot, as we are with all questions relating to land owning interest. The right hon. Gentleman wants the powers of the Secretary of State to be extended for the protection of the personal land interests with which he and his hon. Friends are most sensitively concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I cannot understand is why the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West is so terribly worried about putting into this Bill the very powers, though greatly modified in many respects, given to the Development Corporation under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
Overseas Resources Development Acts. Why has it suddenly become for him a matter for alarm that everything is going to be nationalised—to use his wild phrases—under this Bill, when similar and some more expensive provisions to these were incorporated in legislation for which the hon. Gentleman's party and the former Government were responsible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one goes through the 1959 Act, and many other Acts prior to that, one finds nearly all these powers there. I know that there are other things which we might have borrowed from the Overseas Development Acts for the purpose of this Bill; but, on the other hand, there are things in it which the hon. Gentleman, to be consistent in his criticisms of this Bill, would also have had to criticise had the Government written them into the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks about the Secretary of State taking immense new powers. He is doing nothing of the kind. The hon. Gentleman assumes that the Secretary of State can, for example, tell the Board to go and scrap all the legislation dealing with crofting. That suggestion by the hon. Member is abject nonsense. Any such proposal, even if it can be conceived, would have to be referred to Parliament for that relevant legislation to be repealed. The hon. Gentleman would have a voice in supporting, or in his case obstructing—as many of us would do—the repeal of such legislation, and Parliament would have the final say in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, Parliament really has the final responsibility here, and there is no question of any Secretary of State or Board ignoring or repealing such legislation. No Secretary of State would be so daft as to do that and this situation is one which can be conjured up only in the hon. Gentleman's fevered imagination. The Secretary of State simply will not have power to go to the Board and tell it to set aside and, in effect, wipe out legislation. It is noteworthy, again, if the hon. Gentleman was not concerned about nationalising anything or everything in the Colonies under the 1959 Overseas Resources Development Act, and his views today are strangely inconsistent with his attitude when that Measure was going through the House, with Tory backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
The hon. Gentleman talked about the power which the Secretary of State might give to the Board to direct the compulsory amalgamation of non-viable farms, crofts, and holdings generally. We have been through all that in debate yesterday. We had a lot of interviews yesterday also with lobbying farmers about Government aid to farming. One delegation of farmers approached one of my hon. Friends who is a farmer. Their main criticism of the Government began by a spokesman saying that politicians were all right because they had increased their own salaries. My hon. Friend pointed out that Members of Parliament like farmers had many expenses to meet out of their salaries. The delegation spokesman's next comment was, "Yes but you can add to your salary all the profits from your farms." My hon. Friend, who in fact, has 2 farms, replied, "I thought your argument was that farmers like myself were only making losses, not profits", which rather helped the delegation to destroy their own case about non-viable farming. When the hon. Gentleman talks about amalgamating non-viable farms under a general direction of the Secretary of State to the Board to do so, he is largely talking nonsense. There are very limited provisions elsewhere for certain action to be taken regarding crofts under the Crofters Acts, but the hon. Gentleman should not worry himself quite so much about the fear of any imaginary dictatorship, which we would all resist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my part, I am only worried that that Secretary of State may not exercise his full authority to give sweeping vigorous general directions to the Board, in line with the Government's policy, to ensure that the Highlands and Islands come within the full scope of national economic planning and development I have always been afraid, indeed, that the Highlands and Islands will be left at the end of the queue, as they have been tin the past. I hope that the Secretary of State will be a very busy man in Highland and Island development from now on; but in practice he will frequently consult the Board. For no Secretary of State will risk a clash every few days, weeks, or months, with a Board which he has appointed. He will in practice consult the Board for his own sake, apart from anything else, because if he does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
do so and he and the Board fail on their job, he will be under constant attack in the House of Commons and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West was so anxious to make purely political capital of the occasion that he contradicted almost everything that his Party found acceptable when framing the Acts on which this Bill is so largely based. I think that if there is a good model, there is, of course, no objection to basing other legislation on it. But, at the end of the day, we must be satisfied here; and it is not yet a complete fiction that Parliament has ultimate overall responsibility and control. If that were not the case, the hon. Gentleman might as well give up all hope of achieving or preserving the Parliamentary democracy about which he talked so much on Tuesday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there should be consultation on all important issues on which the Board will be instructed, or invited, to act. Consultation will take place in practice and in advance of any directions being issued, and I for my part have no objection to it being said in the Bill. I think it is highly desirable that there should be provision for consultation; and as in practice consultation will normally take place, I do not see a great deal of strength in the argument against previous consultation with the Board being written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

discuss Amendments 13 and 14 at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of a series of Amendments, the purpose of which is to strengthen the position and independence of this Board. Some of these Amendments are crucial, and others vary in their significance. I attach some significance particularly to Amendments No. 12 and 13 because, without elaborating or going back on what has been discussed, particularly during the Second Reading debate, it seems to me that there are far too many restrictions imposed on the freedom of action by the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in any legislation of this nature there must be a reserve power in the Secretary of State, and I accept what has been said about the numerous examples of that reserve power which are to be found in other legislation, but I criticise the wording of this subsection because it seems to me to provide for the possibility of a great deal of interference by the Secretary of State. Although one must assume, and one is entitled to assume, that the Secretary of State always uses statutory powers with discretion, on the face of it the wording of this subsection is capable of reducing the Board to the status of an agency of the Secretary of State, and it seems to me from what the Minister of State said that that is not the kind of intervention which the Government have in mind, and that what they propose is not intended to reduce the status of the Board in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments No. 12 and 13—my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) will deal with Amendment No. 14—seek to impose a limitation on the scope of the Secretary of State's interference in two ways, and it seems to me that neither of the two ways is such as to invite exception. I am glad that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has already anticipated one of the points which I am about to make by communicating in advance that he agrees with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first restriction—quite apart from the question of courtesy—which it seems desirable to write into a Clause of this nature is that before the Secretary of State gives directions to the Board he should consult it. I do not like the tone of this Clause, particularly when read in the context of the rest of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
Bill. I regard it as vitally important that there should be written into the Clause a statutory obligation on the part of the Secretary of State to consult a Board which has the responsibilities given it by the Bill and which the Secretary of State himself has set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not anticipate any objection to this from the Minister, because he has referred to a number of precedents which exist for this kind of thing. I have not been able to find any example of a power of direction in a situation of this nature being given to the Secretary of State without the concurrent obligation on the part of the Secretary of State to consult the stautory body beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt quite flattered that the hon. Member for the Western Isles took to heart something that I recollect telling him a short time ago. It is true that the Clause is based substantially on the wording of the Overseas Development Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was discussed by the Western Isles Labour Party nine years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When discussing this in a friendly manner with the hon. Gentleman he did not give me the impression that he had this at his fingertips, but perhaps I was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to look at the Clause to realise that similar provisions are to be found in a whole variety of Statutes, and for all I know this may go back further than 1948. I ask the Minister of State to accept the proposal that there should be written into the Bill an obligation to consult. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee by referring to other examples of this obligation to consult, but it is to be found in the New Towns Act, 1946, Section 2(3), the Harbours Act, 1964, Section 3(2), and in the Airport Authorities Bill now going through Parliament. I therefore urge the Minister to accept the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Amendment No. 13 is to restrict the intervention of the Secretary of State to matters affecting the public interest. It gives him a wide discretion, and from what the Minister of State said, both this morning and on Tuesday, it seems that it is not the intention of the Government that the Secre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
tary of Sate should intervene regularly in the working of the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the other interest in which he might interfere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite follow that. The way the Clause is worded means that the Secretary of State could give directions of a general character as to the exercise and performance of the Board's functions. On that view, he could intervene and give general directions on any matter he thought fit. The purpose of the Amendment is to restrict his intervention to broad matters of policy, which is surely the kind of thing the Secretary of State has in mind in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably that is why the type of wording we suggest has been incorporated into other provisions of this nature. Section 2(6) of the Airports Authority Bill, although the terminology is slightly different, embodies both the propositions I am most concerned about in this case. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, give to the Authority directions of a general character as to the exercise and performance by the Authority of its functions in relation to matters which appear to him to affect the national interest, and it shall be the duty of the Authority to give effect to any such directions."</p></blockquote>
The Government have quite properly seen fit to incorporate those obligations in the Airports Authority Bill just as, word for word, they incorporated such a provision in Section 9 of the Overseas Development Act, 1948. Both Amendments No. 12 and No. 13 should be accepted. My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll will say something about Amendment No. 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Member sits down, would he be kind enough to make clear precisely what he means in Amendment No. 13? Precisely what area of the Secretary of State's powers as outlined in the subsection as drafted does he wish to exclude? I have been following the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument with great interest, and I should like him to give a specific example of what difference the Amendment would make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must proceed on the assumption that, where one finds qualifying words in a Section of an Act, they are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
not there for no reason. When one sees a provision in the 1948 Act and in the Airports Authority Bill and other legislation of the type, one asks what the purpose is. It seems to me that the purpose is to preclude the intervention of the Minister concerned in the actions of a public board except where there is a clear issue of public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has still not answered the point as to when the Secretary of State interferes in a manner which is not in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By subsection (1) the Secretary of State could interfere in any circumstances he wished. That is what we complain of. He has the power under subsection (1) to give the Board directions of a general character on anything at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill about that. Some of the examples given earlier may appear to be unlikely in the event that no Secretary of State would say to the Board that it should take over the distillery industry or the hotels in the Highlands. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State has power to do so under this subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might or might not be. I want the Secretary of State's intervention in the Board's activities to be restricted to matters of public interest and to give the Board freedom to get on with the job it has to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Member sits down, could he say whether the Secretary of State could take these actions without coming to Parliament for the necessary authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The Secretary of State is given power under subsection (1) to give the Board general directions on any matter he wishes providing it relates to the functions of the Board, which are so wide that they are all embracing. The Committee should hesitate to leave the wording of the subsection in such unqualified terms, particularly when there is ample and recent precedent for qualifying them in the way I have indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 13 begs the question. The public interest will be in all cases in any event determined by the Secretary of State of the day. What my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State believes to be in the public interest will not, I am sure, be deemed to be in the public interest by hon. Members opposite. I can think of many things to be done in the Highlands which would be, in my view, in the public interest but which would be violently opposed by hon. Members opposite. This matter does not depend entirely on the views of the Secretary of State of the day and the Amendment would not advance the position any further. It would not safeguard it. If hon. Members opposite are suspicious of the Secretary of State, this is not the way to allay those suspicions. They might think of another form of words, but this wording is not suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie) had himself sat down on no fewer than three occasions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary to move it. An Amendment has been moved. No. 14 being discussed at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words of Amendment No. 14 will have a familiar ring to those who sat through the consideration of the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill recently. This group of Amendments raises a serious point and one which the Committee will want to consider carefully. Under Clause 1 there was a certain amount of discussion—perhaps not as much as we would have liked—on the question of the numbers and type and qualities of members of the Board. The Minister of State was unable to tell us much about it except, of course, that he wanted to find a certain number of people who were men of quality though not perhaps necessarily supermen, or teachers or members of the W.R.I., as he said, although not all these people would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
necessarily be excluded. He also said that probably, although there was some dispute about this, the Board would have full time members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind that the advice the Secretary of State gives to a Board of this sort and the way in which it is to interpret that advice are very relevant to the type of person one will be able to get on such a Board. We want the best, and we want full-time people. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has said, in the wording of this Clause there is more than a slight implication that the drafters thought of the Board as a sort of extra department of St. Andrew's House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also—perhaps unfairly—in the minds of some hon. Gentlemen a feeling that the Board may be chosen for other reasons than pure merit. The Minister of State has not been able—and I understand the difficulty—to say who the chairman or any of the members are to be or, indeed, what qualifications the Government are seeking and how they see the thing being set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the Minister is not prepared to accept this sensible Amendment about consultation and in addition is not prepared to accept Amendment No. 13, relating to the public interest. I am always a little doubtful about speaking on these sometimes complicated legal issues but I do not agree with the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) that Amendment No. 13 begs the issue. What we in this Committee do is to lay down what is the law of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State might give some general direction to the Board and he has, under the subsection, arbitrary powers in this respect. It would then be open to a member of the public who felt that he was aggrieved by the direction to challenge it in the courts and the courts might then say that the direction was not in the public interest even though the Secretary of State himself had given it and believed that it was so. There is more than a purely verbal quibble in this and that is why the precise words we propose have been used in many other Acts of the sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister, therefore, does not feel able to accept the first two Amendments
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
we should put in some safeguard so that if the Board disapproved of a general direction by the Secretary of State it would not be forced to put it into effect. If the Government choose good, independent and honest people with their own ideas and they disapprove of an instruction of the Secretary of State, given without consultation on something which the Board has decided is not in the public interest, they would have only one possible way out—to resign in a body. That would be undesirable. I hope that the Minister of State will be able to accept Amendments No. 12 and No. 13. If he does I shall not press Amendment No. 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is customary in a situation such as we are envisaging for the Secretary of State to consult with the chairman of the board concerned and we are therefore prepared to accept Amendment No. 12. I shall not waste any more time on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that Amendment No. 13 would make no difference because the Secretary of State does, or one presumes that he does, act in the public interest. The Amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to matters appearing to him to concern the public interest".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State judges this himself. These words, therefore, do not seem to add anything, for the subsection would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the exercise and performance of their functions in relation to matters appearing to him to concern the public interest …"</p></blockquote>
Therefore, if the words are included they do not seem to limit the Secretary of State any more than the existing wording. He would continue himself judge whether a matter was in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can hardly imagine any Secretary of State taking any action that he does not judge to be in the public interest. That is why I interrupted the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie) to ask him in what circumstances the Secretary of State would act in this matter. In his own mind, any Secretary of State acts in the public interest all the time. No Secretary of State will start giving directions of a general character while knowing that in his own view they are against the public interest. It would not matter what kind of political creature the Secretary of State

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
happened to be, whether Tory or Labour. In his own mind he would believe that this was in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Amendment which I have suggested is so harmless, then will the hon. Gentleman just accept it and then we can all get on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only putting the point that it seems rather unnecessary. I have always advocated in the past that we should never clutter up Bills with words which are unnecessary. I have made very lengthy speeches on this subject. Therefore, I am being perfectly consistent in suggesting that we should not put them in at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the advice I have indicates that these words do not make any difference at all, and I understand that the practice in legislation is that sometimes they are included and sometimes they are not. It is nothing about which I would go to the barricades, but we ought to avoid cluttering up Bills with quite a large number of words which really do not mean anything at all, and do not add to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the last of these three Amendments, that would completely vitiate the power intended to be given to the Secretary of State by this Clause. There would not be much point in the Secretary of State giving directions of a general character, if the Board only had to have regard to them. It need not pay any attention to any of them and it could say, "Of course, we have given regard to them, but we still think that we should go on and do this". So far as we have been able to discover, there is no board which does not have placed upon it an obligation to give effect to directions which are given to it. The New Towns Act, 1946, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… requiring them to exercise those powers in any manner specified in the directions".</p></blockquote>
The Electricity Act, 1947, and the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Authority shall give effect to any such directions".</p></blockquote>
The Crofters (Scotland) Act, 1955—which is one of the Acts of the hon. Gentleman's Government—and the Deer (Scotland) Act, 1959, another of the last Administration's Acts, say:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission shall carry out their functions in accordance with such directions" directions given".</p></blockquote>
The Housing Act, 1964, another of the hon. Gentleman's Government's Acts says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Corporation shall comply with any directions given".</p></blockquote>
The Airports Authority Bill, which has been quoted a very great deal in these proceedings, says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be the duty of the Authority to give effect to any such directions."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) will be very much aware of what is in the Cereals Marketing Bill. I am sure that that is uppermost in his mind at the present moment. That says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be the duty of the Authority to comply with any such directions".</p></blockquote>
I do not think the Opposition had any Amendment down to delete those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a large difference between the Measures to which the hon. Gentleman is referring, and the Bill which is in front of us, in that all of those Measures were, in a sense, narrow—devoted to individual specific purposes? This Clause of this Bill gives the Secretary of State powers to give directions about anything whatsoever. It is enormously broad, without any of the limitations of purpose which were involved in the Measures to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made precisely this point during the Second Reading debate, when I said that there was nothing unprecedented about any of the powers in this Bill. I said that it was rather unusual—I forget the exact words—that they were all being given to one authority, but it is in the nature of this authority that it must have these powers. We must give them all to one authority, as that is in the nature of the Board itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, then, is our attitude to these Amendments. We are quite willing to accept the first Amendment. The second one we do not really think does anything at all, and it just clutters up the Bill with words, but if the Committee were to insist, we would, of course, accept it. I am afraid that we cannot accept the last Amendment, because of the fact that it would vitiate the whole subsection in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three very brief points. First, I am very pleased that the Minister is accepting the first Amendment. Perhaps I may be permitted to make a small drafting comment. If the Minister indeed accepts this Amendment the subsection will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may after consultation with the Board give to the Board directions …"</p></blockquote>
I should have thought, particularly in view of Amendment 15 and knowing that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) is certainly grammatically consistent, that he would have suggested the insertion there of the word "them".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am afraid that the argument about the public interest leaves me still a bit baffled. I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands, would produce some sort of legal definition of "the public interest", in the sense that this did limit the Secretary of State's powers, and that is why I made the intervention. I was not seeking to be difficult. I wanted to be clear, and I am afraid that I am no clearer in my mind as yet. But to me all politics are about the public interest. We are different parties with different concepts of what the public interest is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not for or against the Amendment. It does not seem to make a great deal of difference. I should certainly have opposed the last Amendment, but I am pleased to see that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) does not intend to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the resurrection of this Amendment, which came before us during the period when London, Stansted, Prestwick and Gat-wick Airports were leaving the Ministry to go into the hands of a Board, over which some of us felt we might not, or would not, have the power which we formerly had when the Minister and the Ministry were in charge. In earlier days we could put any question to the Minister about the four airports concerned, as they were Government property. The Minister was resigning his powers in that case, but this present case is one where the Minister is acquiring powers. One Minister was moving out but now another Minister is moving in, and one would imagine that, on the basis of Parliamen-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
tary democracy and Ministerial purpose in giving effect to that purpose, the public interest will be considered. If the public interest were not being preserved, then the Minister and the Government would not remain long in charge of it. That is inherent in the whole matter. With regard to the British Airports Authority, we welcomed the desire of the Tory Opposition to retain some form of Ministerial interest in the airports. They wanted to cling to the shreds of public ownership which has been so much condemned by them in other spheres, and even in this Committee today through the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). They did not want to give up anything, and the Committee, in my view wisely, accepted the Amendment. Obviously, there is a crowd of busy bees in the background at the moment. The Opposition say, "We have discovered this Amendment", and they are carrying it around all the Committees on which they are represented, and serving it up. It suited a purpose with regard to the British Airports Authority, and now they have discovered that it could serve a purpose in the present Committee. Of course, I welcome their efforts, but at one point they want to cling to a departing Ministerial control; at another point they are trying to preserve "the public interest", though it were in conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend has accepted the first Amendment. It is a good one, and I thought it was a good one in the debate on the British Airports Authority. I thought it was a good thing that the Board should be consulted before any conclusions were come to, or before it was given directions, but I cannot see the validity of the comparison. Yet I welcome it, despite the reason that in the case of airports we were concerned with only one single project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill before us we are not concerned with one single project; we are concerned with farming, we are concerned with industry, we are concerned with new industries, we are concerned with a multitude of things, and the application is infinitely wider in this case. One might say that, as the comparison does not exist, the application might not exist. But I believe that the present subsection is too narrow and, therefore, I agree with my hon. Friend in accepting the words "after consultation with the Board".

I believe, as be said, that Amendment 13 is a challenge to something for which every Secretary of State, within his limits, will have regard. Therefore I do not think that the Opposition would be wise to press either of the other two Amendments, because they are inherent in the system of Government which we have today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that, While I am grateful to the hon.

In passing, let me say that I am relieved at the Liberal Party's pleasure in joining with us in having achieved this little dent in the Bill so far, after having said on the Second Reading that they accepted all the powers just like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does cause me personally a little concern—and I do not think we should underrate this—is that when one is talking about functions—and the hon. Gentleman is perfectly aware of this—the functions of the Board are almost unlimited, as my hon. and learned Friend has said. When one reads that they consist of
	<br><blockquote><p>"preparing, concerting, promoting, assisting and undertaking measures for the economic and social development of the Highlands"</p></blockquote>
one perceives they cover absolutely anything which the Board might wish to do. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not deny this. There is no limit at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Last night I heard the Minister say to one of his hon. Friends in the middle of a Prayer that I obviously had been an apt pupil of his for finding my way along the various sections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
But I remember his saying on many occasions that firstly the wording of Bills must be taken fairly literally and secondly we do not legislate for individual Secretaries of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are legislating here and placing powers in the hands of all future holders of that great office. I would not for a moment suggest that, if the Minister aspires to that office, he would wish to take some of the powers which would be available, as I think his bark on the whole has been very much worse than his bite, but the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) is a man of very strong views, and only this morning he said his interpretation of the public interest might be very different from that of his hon. Friends. We know he has taken the trouble to attempt to introduce legislation to enable public undertakings to be set up in Scotland. He regards this as in the public interest. He also has strong views on agricultural subsidies, and support prices might well concern the Board. Last night my hon. Friend quoted some words of the hon. Member for Fife, West, who had asked "Why waste time on these people and on supporting an industry when politically we do not get much out of it?" He was referring to farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What Amendments are we on now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) and other hon. Members may ask why waste time stretching our imaginations into thinking that the hon. Member for Fife, West will ever be Secretary of State for Scotland. It is a remote possibility, but we should not ignore it altogether as stranger things have happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Syndicate may take over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore I strongly urge the Minister to recall some words he spoke on an earlier Measure:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think there is something to be said for having second thoughts. There is nothing wrong with having second thoughts about a thing."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30th January, 1962; c. 39.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore I ask him to have second thoughts about Amendment No. 14 and allow the Board this amount of responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 12 is being accepted and therefore should not be discussed further. Amendment No. 13 is merely concerned with interpretation of words. Hon. Members on both sides feel it would not make a great deal of difference if it were approved or not. I shall concentrate on Amendment No. 14 which is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be discussed more fully as the arguments against it so far have been concerned not with its merits but with a comparison of the powers of the Board with those for colonial development. In the last Parliament, if any Member on this side had suggested that circumstances in Scotland were in any way relevant to an undeveloped Colony there would have been objections. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) related this Bill to the Airports Authority Bill, but that was specialist legislation. We should consider the circumstances of the Board if this Clause is not amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give this power to the Board it would not make an enormous difference to the Board. The Minister suggested that if the Amendment were approved there would be a danger of the Board's running away on its own course and carrying out its own policies without essential Parliamentary control. I do not think that would follow. The powers in Clause 3(1,	<i>c</i>) are of an advisory nature and even this is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. If we accept this Amendment it would not affect the powers in Clause 3(1,	<i>c</i>). Clause 4 deals with the acquisition of land and even if this Amendment were accepted the Board could not acquire land without the approval of the Secretary of State. Clause 6 deals with carrying on a business, and similarly, if the Amendment were accepted, the Board still could not carry out business unless it were approved by the Secretary of State. Under Clause 8 the Board would still not have power to give grants or loans without approval of the Secretary of State and the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment is accepted it will not make any fundamental difference. However, it will make a difference in the drawing up of plans and proposals. We hope to appoint the right men to the Board and we should give them power to lay down their own master plan based
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
on their own knowledge. The Board may decide that future developments should either be based on growth areas or comprehensive development piecemeal, but the Secretary of State may give a general direction with which it disagreed. It would be criminal if we were to appoint a board of independent men with specialist knowledge and then give them directions as to how they should operate. It should be appreciated that if this Amendment is approved we are in no way derogating from the Secretary of State the power to control finances or broad issues of policy or principle. If this Amendment is approved we are giving the right to the Board to lay down its own plans for the Highlands and not simply to carry out the detailed administration after receiving directions from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give the Board this freedom if it is to carry out these functions efficiently. If this Amendment is not approved the Board will become another small department of St. Andrew's House. Neither we nor the Government want this. If this Amendment is approved we give the Board the right to think for itself, decide what policies should be pursued, and decide what policy it wishes to present to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In present circumstances I would not wish to see the Board given power to carry out its own policy of spending money and setting up industry. This should not be done till we have established regional government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless this Amendment is approved a situation could arise in which the Secretary of State would give general directions contrary to what the Board knew was right. This is a serious Amendment, and unless it is accepted the Board will not be as successful as we desire, nor will it attract men of the right calibre who want to assist the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope hon. Members opposite do not think we put down this Amendment just to bring this Bill into line with previous Statutes. I am perfectly satisfied that the interpretation of the words in Amendment No. 13 does make a difference to the provisions of this subsection. In the last resort it is a question of judicial interpretation. There could be two views. As the Clause stands, the Secretary of State is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
given the widest possible power of interference, subject to the one qualification that his directions must be of a general character. He is empowered to make directions of a general character and the Board must give effect to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way to illustrate this is to give an example. It would, presumably, be within the competence of the Secretary of State to give a general direction which had the effect of restricting the power of the Board and its freedom of action. As long as it were a general direction, then it would be within the ambit of subsection (1). The Secretary of State may give general directions, laying down the manner in which the Board's powers will be exercised, and, as the subsection is now worded, this would be perfectly competent, but I doubt whether a court would hold that directions, general in terms but limited in scope, could be regarded on any view as directions involving matters of the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am trying to make is that if the Secretary of State has power to give general directions on a narrow front, as it were, it is at least arguable, and I put it no higher than that, that directions of that nature could not be said to apply to matters appearing to him to concern the public interest. I accept that the illustrations already given, about taking over hotels and the distillery industry and so on, would not on any view be regarded as affecting the public interest. But of necessity a wide discretion is left to the Secretary of State and he has power to restrict the freedom and action of the Board, a power which, without the Amendment relating to the public interest, could not be challenged. If the Amendment were accepted, those powers could be challenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have supported the Amendments with a view to giving the Board more freedom of action. In other words, while I accept, contrary to what some have already said, that the Secretary of State must have a residual power—and I appreciate that my right hon. friend said that if the first two Amendments were not accepted we would certainly want to press the third—and accepting that it would only be on broad issues affecting the public interest that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
the issue would be likely to arise, without an Amendment on the lines of Amendment No. 13 it would not be open to the court to say that it was not enough for the Secretary of State to say, "I think this is in the public interest".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is what the Amendment says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it must be judicially interpreted. The Secretary of State has not arbitrary, but discretionary, powers and there is a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this issue is important. I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman prefaced his remarks by saying that there could well be two views. We can deal only with hypothetical cases, but let us suppose that the Secretary of State thought that there were great possibilities in a certain area, part of a county or a whole county, and gave a general direction to the Board to take what action it thought fit in any direction it thought fit to make the economy of that area viable: that would be a general direction, but the Board could exercise its initiative in carrying it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prefacing my whole argument by saying that I think that the Secretary of State must have these general powers and must have powers to make general directions affecting the public interest. I am concerned with whether, as the subsection is worded, it would be possible for the Secretary of State to give a general direction of a general nature saying that it appeared to him to affect the public interest, but covering only a very narrow field on no view of which could it be said to raise broad issues of policy affecting the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is missing the point. If the Amendment is accepted, the subsection will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may give to the Board directions of a general character as to the exercise and performance of their functions in relation to matters appearing to him to concern the public interest. …"</p></blockquote>
He cannot be taken to court for a decision on that, because he would have decided what was in the public interest and his answer to any charge would be, "I think this is in the public interest".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman very well knows, there is ample authority for the proposition that statutory powers given to a Minister of the Crown are not discretionary powers. There are circumstances in which the exercise of powers of this nature can be challenged in the court—for example, on whether it was a 	<i>bona fide</i> exercise of the powers. The only way in which to challenge whether it is a 	<i>bona fide</i> exercise of the powers is to ask on what possible view it could ever be said by any man in his senses to be in the public interest. If the hon. Gentleman is worried about that, it would be possible to word the Amendment to take out the reference to "appearing to him". That would meet the argument which is put against me, but that would strengthen my position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, it would. The whole argument has been that these words add nothing, because the Secretary of State can say that he thinks that it is in the public interest. But that is not the end of the matter and it is not as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am saying is that I do not believe that these words are meaningless. If they are as meaningless as the hon. Gentleman suggests, I am suspicious that he should be fighting so hard to keep them out of the Bill. They are to be found in other Statutes and in similar circumstances, in legislation affecting the scope of powers and so on. I strongly advise the Committee to accept the Amendment, either as we have worded it, or in some other form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we have the Ministers' reaction to this? I said that if he were prepared to accept Amendments No. 12 and No. 13, and he might feel that a manuscript Amendment would help him to do so, I would not want to press Amendment No. 14. My hon. and learned Friend has made the position very clear. We are in some slight difficulty because, through no fault of Members opposite, they do not have a Law Officer in the Committee to give what may be the opposite point of view. My hon. and learned Friend very fairly said that there could be two points of view. On the other hand, the Minister himself said, and this must be on the advice of his own Law Officers, that he had no objection to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
the Amendment except that he thought it added more words to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me correct the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) first. I said in my first speech that this was not something that I would fight for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry: I missed that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I was not anxious to fight to the last ditch about these words, but I tried to point out in the course of interventions that I regarded these words as meaningless. That was my whole case. We are now asked to accept words which we have not seen. I know that you would not allow that in any case, Mr. Steele, but we are now asked to regard the proposition in the light of what the hon. Member could have put down, but what he has not put down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no. They are not meaningless. What I said about the altering of the wording of the Amendment was to meet the point made against me by saying that that could be met by the deletion of those words. My primary proposition was that the wording as it stood was significant and not meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All our advice is that it does not mean very much for precisely the reason I put to the hon. and learned Gentleman. If he wants to amend it and is saying that there ought to be a possibility of adjudicating on whether the Secretary of State is acting in accordance with the public interest, this raises a rather different issue as to whether something which the Secretary of State did in the interests of the Highlands was in the national interest, whether the two interests would clash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a situation which we ought to avoid. This is another reason, in addition to what I have said about the wording, why it would be a bad thing to create this sense of argument as between the interests of the Highlands and the public interest. I cannot visualise a Secretary of State being so potty as not to act in the national interest. Even if he were potty, he would probably think that he was acting in the public interest. I cannot imagine a Secretary of State acting in a manner not considered by him to be in the public interest.

However, I am prepared to look at this again before Report to see whether it would be necessary or desirable to make an Amendment, but my present view, and that of those advising me, certainly is that these words are not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was interested in what my hon. Friend had to say about the need to cut out superfluous words from Bills. I know my hon. Friend's reputation in this respect, and the whole purpose of my Amendment is to cut out superfluous words. I hope that he will not use the argument which we sometimes hear against these Amendments—that this is common form and has always been done. This sets me very nearly screaming. It is the Conservative argument for the 	<i>status quo,</i> and I am sure that my hon. Friend would not like to be accused of being in any way Conservative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I willingly accept your suggestion, Mr. Steele.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the deepest sympathy with the Minister of State because by abandoning, in a moment of quite reasonable feeling, the normal routine of common form, and if not showing himself to be Conservative, but perhaps being Liberal in this respect, he has quite unintentionally done the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan)
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
out of making a particular point that he wanted to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee can see, Amendment No. 15 is purely grammatical, and the gist of what I and some of my hon. Friends want to speak to is contained in Amendment No. 16. In the Highland areas we have in the past had the help and advice of the Highland Panel. Over the years, under a variety of able and hard-working Chairmen, of whom the hon. Member for the Western Isles was one, it has done a great deal of good work. It is true, of course, that the Panel was appointed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the rather small, but helpful, Amendments which the Minister of State accepted earlier to the Clause, it is still my view that under the various Clauses of the Bill the Board is given practically no powers whatever, and that the Secretary of State holds everything in his own hands. I know that the Secretary of State has to have reserve powers in some respects, and I know that he has to keep a careful eye, either personally or through his watchdogs at St. Andrew's House, on the way in which all these operations take place, but I seriously suggest to the Committee that once the Secretary of State has been able to make up his mind, out of—I dare say it is now several thousand applicants to be members of the Board—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not quite reached that figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seemed to me to be going up at the rate of about 200 a week, and I thought that it had got to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, once the Secretary of State has made up his mind and picked the sort of people whom he wants, then, as happens in many other similar boards of this sort, there is some point in allowing the Board to select, naturally, of course, in consultation with people from St. Andrew's House, its own consultative committee. The Board will have a fairly good idea of the sort of tasks which these people are to undertake. Because of their individual interests and capacities, they will, if they are reasonable and humble people, have a good deal of knowledge of local conditions. I think, therefore, that the Board should decide whom to have on the Consultative Council, and if the selec-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
tion is made in this way, I think that the link between the Board and the Council will be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One knows, having seen many of these cases, that when the Secretary of State has to appoint people he does not himself know all the people, and that his staff do their best, looking at the whole of Scotland, to select people who can serve, and generally do serve, with great distinction on these bodies. I do not think that in the past there has been any great cause for complaint, nor do I think there is likely to be any cause for complaint if the Board is given power to select its own Consultative Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board has been given little enough power in the Bill, in fact practically none at all, and I think that the power to select the Consultative Council would improve the status and dignity of the Board itself. This is done fairly often with boards of this sort, and I think that this is a good opportunity to improve the Bill by accepting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is vitally important that there should be the best possible relationship between the Board and the Consultative Council, but I am not sure that the right hon.

First, he says that the Secretary of State may not necessarily know intimately the people most suitable to serve on this Council, and he may not know the people who have the best knowledge of local problems in the various areas or know the actual areas. I regard it as vital that we should have representation of the various and diverse areas and, as far as possible, of the interests of the areas. Later on we shall discuss an Amendment to the Schedule, and I apologise to the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) for anticipating it in part but it is unavoidable here.

I suggest that it is not necessarily the case that all the members of the Board will be intimately acquainted with the local people in the various areas. What is important is that the Secretary of State should have some obligation to ensure that the Consultative Council—this is different from considerations governing the appointment of the Board—should have regard to, and thorough
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
knowledge of, the interests of areas which might not be well known to the members of the Board themselves. It has been agreed that the members of the Board may not necessarily all be Highlanders or Islanders. I am not suggesting that we cannot go to the Highlands and Islands and find seven wise and suitable men and, even, if the hon. Member for Inverness really insists, seven technically equipped men. All the seven men are not necessarily to come from the Highlands and Islands; and, therefore, it is not necessarily the case that the seven members of the Board or even the majority of them, will know the areas intimately. The problems which they have to consider may come completely fresh to some of them, and, therefore, they may not necessarily be intimately connected or familiar with the local people and interests and the areas with which they are concerned in their task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make is that whoever nominally appoints the people, they may not personally know all the people with whom they are working, at least in the early days. As this is so both of the Secretary of State and on the Board, I am certain that the Board will discuss with my friends in St. Andrew's House who are suitable people, and I would rather see this power given to the Board than to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has taken astute debating advantage of my, perhaps, rather equivocal balance of arguments; but I was making much the same point as he has now made, I think, more clearly. Nevertheless, on balance, as the Secretary to State has all the machinery of consultation in his own Department, I would rather that he were given this power. He has available for consultation, inside and outside his Departments, people who have knowledge of Highland and Island development problems. Many of his civil servants have worked hard with the Highlands and Islands Panel for many years, and there are some people in St. Andrew's House who know more about the Highlands and Islands than most Highlanders do, for the simple reason that they have long made an almost full-time study of the problems there. Indeed, I would not hesitate to draw on the resources of St. Andrew's House wherever possible, even

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
for the selection of some members of the Board. I would not rule out the possibility of selecting civil servants from St. Andrew's House, with special Highland experience and knowledge and I may make suggestions to that effect, but the consultative committee is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has a wide range of knowledge available in his Department, especially among those who Slave served with the Highlands and Islands Advisory Panel over the years. There is also available any number of other people who can advise the Secretary of State on the matter of selecting suitable people for advisory work and consultation; but it certainly is not desirable that the Board should appoint its own Consultative Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
