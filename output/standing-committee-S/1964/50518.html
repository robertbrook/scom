	<p>	<i>Question proposed [13th May],</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned last week I was on the point, which, I think, the Minister conceded, that although it may well be true that for other legislative reasons the Board has not the power to ask for the formal accounts of any company or undertaking, the Board can, under the Clause, obtain by a different route all the information which would be in the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State was arguing that we on this side of the Committee did not want to give to the Board any information. I think I have already demolished that argument. If it is necessary for the Board to have the extremely wide ranging powers given under this Clause, why have such powers not been given—perhaps the Government intend to give them—to the regional economic planning boards? Because, surely, they have a much greater task, if we are to believe what Ministers have been telling us, in trying to plan the whole economic development of Scotland, and yet they have no need for powers of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) has said, Parliament has for centuries been the place where the liberty of the subject is very carefully watched over. I was very glad to hear from the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) that he wishes to say a word or two about this Clause because Liberals do have a long tradition of trying to preserve the liberty of the individual subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fairly easy, in a comparatively short debate of this sort for hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
men opposite to give the impression that they want these powers in order to obtain information from the wicked landlords as to whether they own 553 or 557 acres. This may or may not be a useful operation. In most cases it certainly would not be, but if it were the Clause should have been drawn in that way, but the Clause has been drawn in the widest possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true that in some of our industrial developments in the Highlands, and particularly in, for example, agriculture, in forestry and in fishing operations there is very wide co-operation between the people engaged in them in passing on useful new ideas, new techniques and new methods. There is very little "I have got a new idea and I am going to stick to it myself" in this type of industry. The same cannot be said with anything like the same certainty in the industrial and commercial fields as a whole. There are specialist methods of operation which are of great economic benefit to the firms using them, and if they gave them to their competitors they would get a great deal less in return for the skill and hard work of their workers and shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has not given the Committee one single example to show why this type of information is wanted or what sort of information is likely to be asked for under this Clause. It is difficult for the Opposition, not knowing in the least what is in the mind of the Minister of State, or indeed of the Secretary of State, to try to show to the Committee the possible dangers which may lie in the proposals in the Clause. I have chosen three examples which may give the Committee a not unfair picture of the sort of problem which may well arise. It is simple for the Minister to say that they will not happen, but he is taking powers so that they can happen if he wants them to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first example is the new industry which I hope will grow very fast once it gets established in the Highlands, fish farming. This is a completely new enterprise and a number of firms are actively interested in it. They want to carry out research for growing many different sorts of fish, and some firms are thinking of putting many millions of pounds into the operation. They certainly will not want
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
to give to their competitors information about their skills and the results of their researches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is the drink industry as a whole. On Drambuie the Minister said there may be reasons why information should not be given to anyone else. Almost every firm which distills whisky or brews beer has its own special process, guarded with a great deal of care. The information should not be demanded and given to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third industry which I have looked at from this point of view is one which is very well known to the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), the textile industry. I had a certain amount of interest in it in the old days. It was extremely valuable and important to know what one's competitors were doing—about colour, about design. It is no secret that one's agents in New York or Montreal, or somewhere of that sort, were watching, trying to get the best information about what one's competitors were doing. That sort of information should not be made available to the Board and to its members and to its officers, just for the sake of knowing what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one turns to the business of hotel keepers, crofters and the smaller people, it is very unlikely that the Board will want to question them in detail about what they are doing, what their receipts are and whether they had two or four people bed and breakfasting; but the powers to do it are in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must realise that, and must pay attention to it. I think it was during the Second Reading debate that I said that the Clause gives to the Highland Development Board and to its officers powers which the police, the Inspectors of Taxes, and the Board of Trade do not possess for any purpose, except that when a firm goes bankrupt or is involved in fraud there is, very properly, a public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last period of Socialist Government became famous for two things: snoek and snoopers. It as undoubtedly true that if Parliament passes this Clause it will be licensing snoopers of every sort and description. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, no."] It is true. The Minister says we propose no alternative. Our alternative is to leave
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
the Clause out altogether. The Bill is adequate for the purposes of the Highland Development Board; almost all the information it will require is available from the returns from agriculture, fishing, the Board of Trade, the tourist association, and other sources of that sort. The Board will get much better co-operation, and possibly, in the long run, more accurate returns of the information it really needs, by going to the people and getting it from them willingly and cheerfully. Highlanders are not a non-co-operative race by nature. They are only non-co-operative when the Government are trying to force them to do something which they know they should not and need not do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the Clause should be opposed. There is no need to put anything else in its place. If there is such a need, we have had absolutely no indication of it whatever from the Minister of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important and wide-ranging Clause and it is all the more surprising that the debate has been, so far, rather a damp squib. I expected that when the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) released his hordes and
	<br><blockquote><p>"oot the hellish legion sallied"</p></blockquote>
we would hear some very powerful dialectic indeed, but we have not had it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only argument of substance was that advanced by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell), that the gathering of information by inquiries of this sort may well require the expenditure of a great amount of money which may place an unfair burden upon individual firms and owners. In dealing with that point, the Minister of State did not, I felt, go far enough, for it was a valid point. When we had the example of setting up competitive Drambuie plants all over the Highlands instanced by the former Secretary of State I was really astounded. Any example so far fetched inevitably devalues the general argument adduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be special circumstances in which the Board would require information to enable it to go ahead with its work, which it might otherwise not be able to do. I think that is accepted by a number of hon. Members on this side of the Committee. Where we have concern is at the possibility of the misuse of the powers,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
and it was on that aspect of the matter that the right hon. Member for Argyll concentrated and gave various examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many Governmental powers which could be grossly misused, but that is prevented by the existence of Parliament, by the fact that we are a democratic society, and also by the fact that Government, however large or small their majority, particularly in special circumstances of this kind where the work of a board so largely depends upon the co-operation of the people, would not think of embarking upon the sort of thing which the right hon. Member for Argyll spoke of. It is theoretically possible, but theory has to be modified by what is practical and what is likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I was concerned at the possibility of misuse. In this respect, I was greatly assured by the fact that the Minister of State accepted, in principle at any rate, my Amendment, which would give an opportunity for an appeal when people felt that this was a gross misuse and an unfair use. Some hon. Members said that they thought that the courts would give a very wide interpretation of the provision that the Board must reasonably exercise its powers. I am sure that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) would be a fair guide here. I have not heard him say anything thus far which is unfair or unreasonable. If the Board proposed to set up a Drambuie plant in Skye and for the purposes of doing so requested the necessary information, and if in those circumstances the firm of Drambuie appealed, I cannot see that a court could possibly uphold the Board, because this would be so against the purpose and intent of the whole exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which must always be borne in mind is that this is a very special Board, set up to meet very special circumstances. It has been set up to tackle a problem which has bedevilled Scotland for a very long time. In those circumstances, it is inevitable that it is being given powers in excess of those to which I, as a Liberal, would normally be willing to accede. Special circumstances inevitably breed special solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to what the hon. Member is saying. If I may say so, he is failing into exactly
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
the same type of argument as that followed by the Minister of State, who said that the Government will probably not want to use any of the powers and that they have not got any idea of what they will use them for. It would help the Committee if the hon. Gentleman, apart from talking in wide generalities, would say what sort of things he imagines these powers would be needed for. I have tried exceedingly hard, but I have not found guidance from anyone in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said in the course of his speech that Highlanders are not unco-operative. He said that he would not normally expect a Clause of this sort to be necessary, because Highlanders in the main are cooperative, particularly when they recognise that something is designed for the advantage of the area. However, there are many people living in the Highlands who are not at all co-operative. I can well visualise a situation in which a landowner could put obstacles in the path of the Board. Indeed, in the past landowners have frequently put obstacles in the path of people who wanted to set up enterprises in various places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing to do with the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has. I can think of an example where the Board would be in difficulty. I do not want to quote it, because the gentleman I spoke about at the time threatened me with a libel action once before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman need not worry about that here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of an example where the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was making borings with a view to the setting up of a hydro scheme in an area in my constituency. The argument was adduced by the landowner in public that this scheme would have very serious detrimental effects on tourism in the area. How is the Board to establish whether an argument such as this is valid? I said at the time that I thought that the landlord was a hypocrite because in fact there was virtually no tourism in the area and tourism was strongly discouraged in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
I should have thought that it would be necessary here to get some statistical information to find out whether an argument such as this is valid. In that case one would either accept what the landlord said as true or one would have to get information from somewhere. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman to the extent that I would certainly welcome a little more information from the Minister of State as to the precise kind of situations in which he would visualise the power being used. I, for my part, regrettably, but very certainly in the situation of the Highlands now, am prepared to accept that this is necessary. Consequently, I am prepared to support the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). As the Clause stands, there is nothing to stop the Board from demanding and getting secret processes from a firm. The Minister of State said that this was not so, but I would like him to explain a little more why it is not so, because it is far from clear in this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is this. If a group of people or an industry wanted to set up in the Highland area and sought advice, I, for one, would be bound to tell them that they might be in competition against the Board which has these enormous powers and that they would be better advised to go elsewhere where competition is more level and fair. This would have to be pointed out to any new group of people coming to the area, whether they were Scottish, English or foreign. It is a very big factor. If people really understood the position, they could be put off from coming to this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court will not have powers to say whether or not the Board should indulge in a particular undertaking. What it will have power to do, as the provision stands at the moment, is to say, if the Board demands special information from an undertaking, whether that is reasonable or not. The court will not have power to say that the whole matter is unreasonable or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee realises that we are breaking new ground here. We are giving more power to a statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
body than is to be found anywhere in our legislative history. As the Minister of State pointed out both on Second Reading and last Thursday, there are examples of statutory powers to acquire certain information. As I understand it and from my researches into this over the last few weeks, these powers seem to fall into two broad categories. First, a number of Statutes, some of which have been referred to, confer the power to ascertain the name and address of persons with an interest in land. That is quite common and quite understandable in matters relating to the acquisition of land and the development of land. There are numerous examples of power to obtain that type of information being granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category is where the statutory body is given more general powers linked to the functions of the statutory body itself. In all those cases it will be found that the main function of the statutory body is as a source of subsidy or a source of provision of grants. In all those cases, where the main function of the statutory body is to provide grants and subsidies, there is an understandable power to acquire general information on which the basis of those grants and subsidies can be calculated. It is an application of the principle of a means test, in a way, the kind of thing one gets in the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act where, before legal aid is granted, power is given to the National Assistance Board to ascertain the whole means and circumstances of the applicant. In all those cases the power has been granted as a means of enabling the statutory authority to fulfil its rather limited functions. I appreciate that Clause 8 gives powers to this statutory body to give financial assistance by way of grants or loans, but there is a whole host of other functions pertaining to this statutory body which takes this development out of a proper field of comparison with the other examples which the Minister of State has given from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will look briefly at some of the examples the Minister of State gave last Thursday. He mentioned, first, the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947. Under Section 106 of that Act the Secretary of State and other statutory bodies, including local authorities, may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
have power to serve notice on the occupier of premises requiring the occupier to state in writing the nature of his interest in the premises and the name and address of any other person known to him as having any interest in the premises. That is an example of the first type of information which a statutory body may acquire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the Minister of State gave as his second example—he founded strongly on this—the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, Section 11(1) of which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person engaged in the white fish industry shall keep such books and records as may be prescribed, and the Authority may"</p></blockquote>
give a notice on such a person requiring the production of such books and records and the provision of information along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of the other type of power. One realises from Section 4 of that Act that the primary function of the Authority is to provide grants and loans to enable the individual to play his part in that industry. That is the type of information which the Authority requires to have before it can properly assess the kind of assistance it is to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State mentioned the Crofters (Scotland) Act, 1955. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, but I could not find an example of this power in that Act. I may be wrong. I looked at it rather quickly. Such a power certainly is contained in the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1931.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the Minister of State quoted the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act, 1958. This, again, is an example of the type of power I was speaking of earlier. Section 10 provides that the Secretary of State may require the owner or occupier—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Section 15 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. I have not got the Act here. I looked through it quickly. I overlooked that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 10 of the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act, 1958, provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may require the owner or occupier … to state … the nature of his own interest in such land and the name and address of any other person known to him as having an interest therein and to furnish …"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
a description of the land. I concede that it goes on to give the Secretary of State more general powers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such information as he may specify, being information which in his opinion is necessary"</p></blockquote>
to enable him to fulfil his functions under that Act. Under this Act the primary function of the Minister is to provide grants in respect of improvement orders under Section 9, these orders having been applied for by the owner or occupier under Section 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act, 1961, Section 9(1) provides the earlier example. It provides for giving the name of the occupier or owner of land, whether in the area or not, and the name and address of any other person known to the owner or occupier as having an interest in that land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then he quoted two further examples in 1964—the Industrial Training Act and the Harbours Act. Again, these are special examples because the function of the body acquiring the information is exceedingly narrowly based in both cases and the kind of information sought is specified and restricted to the narrow function of both statutory bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even supposing that no precedents could be quoted for the Government deciding to give these powers, would that be an argument against the Government deciding in their wisdom that these powers were now necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not suggest for one moment that because a thing has never been done in the past it cannot be done now. My point is that we are breaking new ground and that the examples which have been put forward as precedents are not precedents at all. We are thrown back on the argument that this is a new body with new functions. The argument is that this is a novel proposition and that a new body of this nature cannot proceed on precedent but must have new powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us remember what the Board must do and its functions. When we remember this, we realise how distinct this development is. Its functions are stated in the widest possible terms in Clause 1—the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands. Then we go to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
the powers. I accept that other examples of these powers are to be found piecemeal in other legislation. I suggest that we are now in a unique field because the powers are all rolled together. Under Clause 4 there is power to acquire land by agreement or compulsion. There is power under Clause 10 to obtain entry on to land. There is power under Clause 5 to develop land which has been acquired. There is power under Clause 6 to carry on any business or undertaking, whether of a commercial nature or not. It is against this background that the broad terms of Clause 11 must be viewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is: to enable the Board to fulfil these functions is it necessary that it should have these broadly based powers? I read with interest what the Minister said about the powers to recover accounts, and reference was made to the Income Tax Act, 1952. It is true that the Clause does not require the production of accounts, but, as the Minister knows, the kind of information which the Board is empowered to seek could satisfactorily be obtained or revealed only by the production of accounts. It is rather special pleading to say that we are interested not in the accounts but in the information contained in the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a vastly different thing. The hon. and learned Gentleman should know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that is a vastly different thing. I am not so sure about that. If what is wanted is the information contained in the accounts, it can be obtained in a variety of ways. One of the easiest ways is for the person on whom the notice is served to produce the accounts. But these powers certainly are exceedingly wide.

Something was said the other day to the effect that everything must be reasonably done and that the word "reasonably" appears in the Clause. This is a totally different approach from the approach of the Minister to the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Bill. It has been said that under the 1951 legislation the word "reasonable" appears throughout the Act but that it is missing from the Bill. I confess that I supported the Government view, because I do not think that it was necessary to put the word
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
"reasonable" in that Act and it adds nothing to the Bill. All statutory powers must be exercised in a 	<i>bona fide</i> manner and the courts will always interfere on application if there is any suggestion of those powers not being exercised in a 	<i>bona fide</i> manner. How is a court to decide whether a statutory body may reasonably acquire information having regard to the wide functions of this statutory body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I quote what the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State said in another place when he was discussing the rivers purification Bill. The question was whether "reasonable" should go in the Bill. I agree with what he said, which was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… at the moment I believe that what is in the Bill will give as much protection as before and, in fact, may well give more, because, after all, the words 'reasonable' and 'unreasonable' are very difficult to define. What one man thinks is unreasonable another thinks is completely justified".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>House of Lords,</i> 25th February, 1965; Vol. 263, c. 953.]</p></blockquote>
If we set up a statutory body and give it wide powers of this nature, they must be discretionary powers, and a court will not readily interfere with the exercise of those powers. It would interfere only if it could be shown that the use made of those powers was so wide of the mark and so unrelated to any purpose which the Board could possibly have in mind that it could be said that they were being exercised in 	<i>mala fides.</i> Only in that extreme case would a court interfere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) gave the manufacture of Drambuie as an example. He said that if the Board decided to set up a plant to manufacture Drambuie, no court would support that. I disagree with him. If a witness from the Board says, "In our view, the erection of a plant of this nature in this part of the country is necessary for the social and economic development of the Highlands and Islands" that satisfies the test. There is no other test applied. Otherwise, the court would be taking over the functions of the statutory body. We cannot trim a statutory board's wings in this way. No court would ever agree to it. If we give a statutory body wide powers, only 	<i>in extremis</i> would a court interfere. That is why we must always be careful about giving these powers.

I fully appreciate the argument that this is a new development and that it is no use looking at the past and quoting precedents. I do not necessarily wholly disagree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause only gives power to obtain information. It does not give power to undertake or to operate anything or to set up a Drambuie development board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are looking at the nature of the powers. I am not concerned about whether the Board would do this or whether the Secretary of State would consent to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) made the point that a tremendous amount of information already comes under other legislation. He is much better informed on that matter than I am. If the Government feel that something in addition to that is required, why not let us try to specify it? Why take the easy way out and give a broad power which will be quoted as a precedent for evermore? If this goes through, it will be applied in Bill after Bill. People will say, "You set up a board with the widest possible functions and gave it the widest possible powers". No one brought up in the tradition of the Common Law could look on this kind of thing other than with the greatest alarm. I ask the Government to think carefully about this matter to see whether it is possible to achieve what they want to achieve in a more specific way without giving the exceptional and unique powers embodied in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

have already said a great deal about that matter and I do not propose to say any more because we could argue about the precedents for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) came to the nub of the case in the latter part of his speech when he said that we have to ask ourselves whether these powers were necessary. He agreed that we were giving the Board very wide powers and a specific job which covered a large number of activities. I take it that it is agreed that if the Board is to do its job it will have to have certain information and, therefore, the type of information which it will require, because of the wide nature of its functions, will be of a rather wide character. The Board must have certain powers. We do not propose to give powers which it does not require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is giving the Board full powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. and learned Gentleman has read the subsection. I do not like clashes with legal authorities on legal matters, but we must enter the lists and see what we can do about the matter. I propose to do that in a moment. We must first consider this subsection in the light of the safeguards in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first safeguard is that the information must be required by the Board for the execution of any of its functions. It seems to me that this is right. If we set up a Board to perform certain functions and the Committee agrees about the nature of these functions, we cannot say that it must not have the information which will enable it to carry out those functions. This would not be logical. The Board cannot ask for information simply because it thinks that it would be fun to get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second safeguard is that it must be able to show that the information is not only required for the execution of its functions, but is "reasonably" required. The hon. and learned Member said that this does not mean anything. I should not mind betting a pound to a penny that if I had tabled an Amendment to delete the word "reasonable" hon. Members opposite would have opposed it and I should have listened to all sorts of arguments about why "reasonable" should be in the Bill. I am informed that while
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
the court would interfere in case of 	<i>mala fides</i>—I love this language—it would also interfere if it thought that the action was 	<i>ultra vires</i> and not reasonably required in relation to all the circumstances, including those of the business affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was 	<i>mala fides</i> it would also be 	<i>ultra vires,</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, but it could be 	<i>ultra vires</i> without being 	<i>mala fides.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is relevant to the point the hon. Gentleman was trying to make, namely that the Court would not take action simply because an action was 	<i>ultra vires.</i> We disagree and therefore we think that the word "reasonably" is something of a safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third safeguard—this is where I cannot help feeling that hon. Gentlemen opposite have not read the subsection is that the information must be reasonably required by the Board for the execution of its functions in relation to the business or undertaking. I ask hon. Members to read the last, part of subsection (1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"… therein require him to furnish them with such information as may be specified in the notice with regard to the land, business or undertaking and with regard to such other matters relating thereto, as the Board may reasonably require for the execution of any of their functions under this Act in relation to the land, business or undertaking."</p></blockquote>
I draw particular attention to the final words. These are very limiting words. Although the Board may think that it would like to set up a Drambuie factory, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested, it has not the power to ask for information from distillers producing Drambuie—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is how I am advised. The Board has no power to do so because it is not carrying out its function in relation to the factory from which it is asking for the secret recipe. This is the advice. I have gone into it very care fully—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is now agreeing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask one other question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but that is not what the right hon. Gentleman said. That is not what has been said by hon. Members opposite. My understanding of this from reading the Clause—I am no lawyer—is that the words I have referred to tighten it up. In fact the Board cannot ask for that information because it is not doing something in relation to the undertaking from which it is seeking the information. It is limited to the business affected by what it is doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does that tie up with the power compulsorily to acquire land? If it is land upon which a distillery operates, although the business cannot be acquired compulsorily, the land could be, and the business taken over in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One cannot take over a business. One takes over buildings, and that is altogether a different matter. It is being done every day, not by the Highland Development Board. Edinburgh Corporation has bought up hundreds of acres; taken over all sorts of businesses; put people out of business and paid compensation for them to be able to start elesewhere. But it does not take over the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain a little further? Surely the critical word is "functions". The Clause reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"… as the Board may reasonably require for the execution of any of their functions under this Act in relation to the land, business or undertaking."</p></blockquote>
The nature of the functions could largely be determined by the instructions given to the Board under the provisions in Clause 2 by the Secretary of State. Surely this is the broad horizon of uncertainty which troubles many of my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the word "functions" has a meaning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but the "functions" of the Board in that subsection relate not to all the businesses and concerns in an area, but to the land, business or undertaking with regard to which the Board is exercising these functions. As I understand it, that is what is meant by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
last four or five lines of that subsection. That has not been the basis of the arguments advanced by hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we see this operating? Let us take an actual case. I understand a suggestion has been made by the Shetland County Council that a spinning mill be established in the Shetlands. That is a project which has been under examination by various people over the years. If such a proposition is to be effectively considered by the Board, obviously it would require some information about production, the existing outlets for wool and information about the various aspects of marketing generally. These would be items of information required for the exercise by the Board of its functions, which in the case we are considering would be the provision of marketing services to this and similar businesses in the area. In other words, the Board would be helping the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought about this matter a great deal. I visualise that it would be useful and helpful to the people from whom the information is sought for them to give it. Let us consider an area suitable for tourism where there was a request that the Board should establish accommodation. Surely, to prevent the Board from doing something which would be foolish, or likely to damage the natural interests of the area, it would be useful for the Board to have information about the demand for accommodation. In most cases, I suppose, it would seek the information from an existing hotel owner. We expect that the Board would go to the hotel owner and say, "There is here a demand for accommodation. It is not being met by the existing accommodation and there is a demand that the Board supply it. We think it would be better if you extended your premises." The hotel owner might say, "I have not the capital to do so", and the Board could assist him. The Board would be in a position to do that. Surely that would be much better than if the Board, not knowing and not having access to information, set about building another hotel or doing something on its own. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is trying desperately hard to find some method to justify this ridiculous
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
Clause. Even so, the point is perfectly clear. If the hotel keeper was in the position described by the hon. Gentleman he could at the moment go to the Board of Trade and give information to the Board of Trade and obtain help. This is not something which is new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Incidentally, if the hotel keeper went to the Board of Trade he would have to give precisely all the detailed information—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And that is why it is not necessary here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—about which hon. Members opposite have been objecting, and that, incidentally, is one of the answers to the right hon. Gentleman when he talks about our not giving information to the Scottish Planning Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible under the provisions of this Clause to visualise the Board being given power to go to every boarding house in Scotland, and count the number of beds and the number of lodgers and levy sixpence per night for each lodger and similar powers of that kind. Surely my hon. Friend does not—I hope he does not—visualise the provision of snooping powers of that kind, which is the sort of power the right hon. Member visualised himself for the Scottish Tourist Board in his Scottish Tourist Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These were powers which would have been sanctioned without much quarrel by the right hon. Gentleman in his Bill relating to tourists, whatever it was called, which he had to withdraw. I do not wish to enter into a discussion about that. I am suggesting that in most, if not all cases, the Board is asking for information—I have already indicated the safeguards about this sort of information for which it could ask—will be operating in the interests of the people in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Hitler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says it is like Hitler. That is nonsense.

I do not wish to continue the argument but it seems to me that the Board has to have powers to enable it to carry out its functions. To the best of our ability we have ensured that these functions are limited by the provisions in the Clause to the actual requirements of the Board. We have put safeguards into the Bill. I wish to point out also that we have the safeguard that the proposals have to be approved by the Secretary of State. Hon. Members opposite have tried to remove the powers of the Secretary of State but they should remember that this is an additional safeguard. There is also the safeguard of the need for Treasury approval. It seems to me that with all these safeguards there is no likelihood of there being any abuse of the powers. By magnifying this matter and by drawing a picture which bears no comparison to the realities of the situation, hon. Members opposite are doing great damage to the Highland area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>which was said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). In neither the first nor the second series of his remarks, about this being related to the functions of the Board and the same being 	<i>ultra vires,</i> has the Minister understood that it is almost impossible to be outside the functions of this Board in terms or the powers written into earlier Clauses. The Minister referred to the best advice he could get—and I give him credit for having at long last tried to get some good advice. Personally, I do not believe that advice. I can say no more, because I am not legally qualified. I also have received advice and I do not believe the view of the Minister of State.</p>
	<p>All the most ridiculous things which have occurred in this world have been done by people who stood up and said, "Of course, it is for the good of the general public in the area. They do not know what they want, poor things." This is the most lamentable type or argument. When we question the powers the Government search about and say that this action is precedented and perfectly normal. Then their spokesman is driven to say that the powers are unprecedented—</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and he changes his argument and says they are not unprecedented but are good for the people in the area.

	<div class='title'>Clause 12.—(RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee. My hon. Friends and I tabled an Amendment to delete Clause 12. That was done in case the Committee decided not to accept Clause 11, when this Clause 12 would have had no particular function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two small points I wish to put to the Minister of State about the Clause. If the Board is to obtain the sort of information we have been discussing—and some of it must be confidential; some of it may be highly confidential—it is right that there should be safeguards to prevent that information from being improperly spread around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a genuine problem in the Highlands in matters of this sort, because information tends to pass by various means, not always connected with the Postmaster-General. The tomtom system is probably a quicker system of disseminating information in the Highlands than it is elsewhere, and information of a confidential type could be spread rapidly, causing damage and worry to the people who had, perhaps, willingly given information to the Board. I hope that the Board and its officers will be aware of the damage that could be done to their good name if confidential information were circulated. We are also setting up a Consultative Council, and no doubt, a great deal of this information will go to that committee; otherwise its advice will not be worth having; obviously the committee will not be able to advise on any problem if it does not know the background to it. It will be seen, therefore, that some of this information may be very widespread, and I hope that the Board, the Secretary of State and the Department will take a good deal of trouble to impress the importance of confidentiality in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I have in mind is in subsection (2) and concerns the fine of £100. Is that sufficient? I believe that the phrase in that subsection
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any person discloses any information…."</p></blockquote>
would cover the case not only of the man telling people about the information but
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
the sort of chap who might leave papers lying around. In the last day or two we have had a rather remarkable example of how even a Cabinet Minister now tends to leave confidential papers lying around in a restaurant. In this era, when people are paid a great deal of money and can afford to work in the most expensive restaurants in London and leave their papers there, £100 is probably equivalent to 10 meals, so I am not altogether certain that it is a big enough fine. I am certain that if the right hon. Gentleman concerned were to be imprisoned for two months that would be a grave embarrassment, but that would not happen because he did not mean to leave his papers lying in the restaurant: he just left them there. This shows that the Minister of State might be wise to consider whether a fine of £100 is enough, considering the rather extraordinary way in which some people seem to live these days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think that the penalties are fairly substantial and that they meet the requirements of the Clause. After all, a man can be given imprisonment of up to two years plus a fine of £100. That is not an insubstantial penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be on indictment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would, but it is a substantial penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then asked about the extent to which confidential information might be used or distributed and what safeguards would be taken. As he knows, confidential information is distributed to various bodies at various times for specific purposes. The Highland Advisory Panel, for example, has been provided with confidential information from time to time for the purposes of its discussions. I am informed that there has been no indication of the Panel having abused the confidentiality of the information and that invariably it has honoured the trust put in it. That has been the practice of the Panel and I think that that replies to the right hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If experience showed that the use of the powers in Clause 11 was not turning out as expected, it would be open to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to give a general direction to the Board
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
further safeguarding the confidentiality of the information. In other words, if my right hon. Friend thought that the arrangements being worked were not satisfactory, he could give a general direction to the Board perhaps limiting distribution still further and making sure that a much tighter hold was kept on the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to people leaving documents lying about, I do not know how one could do much about that. One is unable to safeguard against that sort of thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a simple drafting Amendment which we thought would commend itself to the Minister of State as being an improvement on the wording of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first saw the Amendment, I did not quite understand the reason for it, since the Clause as drafted seemed to make good sense. Subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall keep proper accounts and other records in relation to the accounts and prepare in respect of each of their financial years a statement of account in such form as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine."</p></blockquote>
That seemed to me to be good and intelligible English, and I was, therefore, rather puzzled by the Amendment. The hon. Gentleman thinks that its inclusion would make the subsection clearer. If the Committee thinks likewise I do not mind accepting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"being a form which shall conform with the best commercial standards".</p></blockquote>
We now come to the first of a number of Amendments all of which have the main object of bringing the Clause into line with similar provisions where corporate bodies have been set up under other Acts of Parliament. The wording of the Amendment is in the standard form which has been used on other occasions. In particular, I draw attention to the fact that these words appear in the Airports Authority Bill and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Member care to suggest, in view of his remarks, that some other Amendments be discussed at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not sure, Mr. Steele, whether that would be convenient to the Committee. Perhaps Amendment No. 125, standing in the names of some of my hon. Friends, might be taken with this one, if my hon. Friends are agreeable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I myself had thought that Amendment No. 125 and Amendment No. 40 might be taken together.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be convenient to take Amendment No. 39 by itself, and, if you have it in mind, Mr. Steele, to take some of the other Amendments together later.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the general principle, to which I have drawn attention. I was then turning to the wording of the Amendment and was pointing out that that wording appears in Clause 8 of the Airports Authority Bill. That Measure was presented by this Government and in Clause 8(1) of it we find the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… being a form which shall conform with the best commercial standards".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends and I do not see why in this Bill the Government should be, as we see it, treating the Highland Development Board as if it were a Department of the Government—in fact, a Department of the Scottish Office. That is what the present way of dealing with the accounts and auditing of the Board's financial affairs amounts to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have complained on past Clauses that the Board appears to be becoming too much under the thumb of the Secretary of State and the accounting procedure seems to be another facet of the same thing. I will develop this theme on later Amendments. The Board is being treated like a Department of the Government, and we would have hoped that it could have had more independence and discretion and be treated in these matters like the new Airports Authority and other bodies, which have been given a different system for the auditing of their accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, the purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that the accounts of the Board will be in
	<br><blockquote><p>"a form which shall conform with the best commercial standards".</p></blockquote>
By which, I assume, is meant the best outside commercial standards. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the fact that there are precedents for this and he quoted the Airports Authority Bill. We also have precedents in the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Act and dealing with other nationalised boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not valid precedents for the Highland Development Board. Here, we are not concerned with a Board with activities of a kind from which a reasonable return is expected or required. That is the case with many other boards which have been mentioned. We are
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
concerned with a Board which will be fully Government-financed; the activities of the Board will necessarily be of a kind from which the Board cannot expect a reasonable return. There will be schemes of development which will mean breaking new ground or pioneering in new ways. That is what the Board is being established to do. For that reason we propose to finance the Board in the way we have chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, the projects will be designed to secure amenities and social facilities; quite clearly these are not things for which commercial accounting methods or standards would be appropriate. The accounting methods and arrangements of the Board are, therefore, to be related to those appropriate to development through the Government. The channel of control and audit is accordingly the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does not mean that the standard of accounting will be any less stringent or that the form in which the Board's activities are presented in accounts will be any less informative than if they were made up in the way hon. Members opposite have in mind. The best Government or public standards are every bit as high as the best commercial standards, in form and substance of accounting. East has its place and function. We are in no doubt that what we have provided for the Highland Development Board is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can quote precedents. What we are now suggesting accords with the provision made in the Sea Fish Industry Act for the White Fish Authority, in the Housing Act for the Housing Corporation and in the Harbours Act for the National Ports Council. It should be noted that subsection (1) of the Clause provides for the statement of accounts to be in such form as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine. The need for high standards in presentation and informativeness of the accounts will be kept very much in view. After this explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find it possible to withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not satisfied with the Clause in its present form. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
think I may be able to develop this argument again on a later Amendment. We would prefer to have the wording as we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Committee prefer that Amendment 125 should be treated by itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 8, line 16, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Separate statements of account shall be kept in relation to any business or undertaking carried on by the Board, whether directly or through an agent, by virtue of the powers contained in section 6 of this Act.</p></blockquote>
This Amendment was placed on the Paper rather later in the day than most of the other Amendments, namely after the Committee had agreed to Clause 6. It will be appreciated that as we on this side of the Committee were opposing Clause 6 it would have been unwise to put down an Amendment relating to its detailed application before the Clause had been ordered to stand part of the Bill. In the circumstances, I hope that the Minister of State will accept this as a constructive Amendment to deal with some of the loopholes arising out of applications of the Clause. The Minister of State has not shown much flexibility in considering Amendments. He has, indeed, referred to some of them as wrecking, destructive, misleading or unhelpful. I hope that he will consider my Amendment in a different light, and as a sensible one intended to deal with dangers arising out of Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unwise and out of order for me to discuss in any way or to reargue the merits of Clause 6. Let us remember that that Clause gives the Board the right to set up businesses and start undertakings in the Highlands and elsewhere, and that this will involve the expenditure of a great deal of public money. In the discussion on Clause 6 we received a number of assurances from the Minister that the Board would not use its power as a means of replacing private enterprise with public enterprise, or as a means of achieving back door nationalisation. An assurance which was helpful was that the Government do not intend to use these powers to an enormous extent. Nevertheless, the Clause has been passed, and we have to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
sure that public money is used sensibly and wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to do that is to get full information of how the money is being used. In the initial stages things might be going wrong and money might be wasted, and if so, the House and the public in general should know something about it. Despite all the arguments about nationalisation, our experience has been that public enterprise tends to stagnation, inefficiency and extravagance. Few of us would not accept that those weaknesses can arise and that we have seen many examples of them in Government, nationalised, and even in municipal affairs. We must find a way to prevent these dangers from arising, and my Amendment suggests that there should be separate accounts for each undertaking and each business carried on under Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several ways in which we can control this development. We could have a categorical assurance that the activities of the Board would be looked over by some other and independent organisation, but I have not put forward this idea. All we are suggesting is that we should find a means of providing the maximum of information. Although we put forward this suggestion, I have listened to several speeches from the Government benches, including those by the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), suggesting that the way to stop inefficiency and the danger of power being misused is to provide the maximum information and means of criticism. For that reason, and because I feel that public enterprise can lead to waste and extravagance unless it is carefully scrutinised, I suggest separate and detailed accounts for each undertaking. Such information should be provided for us and for the public at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be more careful about public money which has been entrusted to us by the people than about our own money. In view of the possibility of disastrous projects being undertaken and a great deal of public money being lost, it is important that we should have specific provision for separate accounts because of the danger of the losses being hidden in larger accounts covering a wider field of activity. One disastrous project could involve great losses, perhaps because of administrative incompetence and inefficiency, and there is the danger of these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
things being hidden in large accounts covering a whole field of activity. I do not expect that each activity will have a profit straight away, but let us have the facts and the information so that, if there is disaster and enormous loss, we shall know about it and be able to ask questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second reason arises out of a point raised by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). He referred to certain private bodies and enterprises being of the opinion that MacBrayne's were operating in an unfair way in competition with other companies, by using Government subsidies to undercut private industry. It is because of possibilities like this that it is essential that the maximum information should be provided. If it is not provided, and if there is a Government factory, or a publicly supported factory, which is paying wages of a certain order, and perhaps employing quite a large number of people, private enterprise may say, rightly or wrongly, that the factory is being wrongly run on taxpayers' money. We should have no idea of how to judge the truth of wild rumours unless we were provided with the maximum of information. That is what we are asking for. The public is entitled to know what is being done with its money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are new developments, and we should ensure that the public have detailed information of the activities. Over the last few years we have seen a large sector of public spending out-with our normal scrutiny. We must provide protection. The protection which the Minister suggests through the Secretary of State and the Treasury scrutinising the affairs of the Board is not adequate. We want to provide information for Members of Parliament and the public, and the best way of doing this is to have separate and detailed accounts year by year of each activity. I hope that the Minister will accept this as a constructive Amendment which will help the Board with its activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would reinforce the points which have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). I am particularly concerned with his point
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
about the possibility of severe losses on enterprises started by the Highland Board being covered up in larger accounts. I am thinking of a case in my district where we have State management of hotels and public houses. The accounts of two districts are lumped together, and nobody has any idea whether or not the profits of one hotel are covering losses on the other 16. This is particularly relevant, because the Highland Board may contemplate an extension of the Cromarty State management business, despite the wishes of another place, which has put forward a Scottish licensing Bill to allow free competition in State management districts, but the Government are not allowing time for its discussion. It is of great importance that we should not have profitable industries carrying the unprofitable ones along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our discussion on Clause 11 much was made of the Drambuie firm and perhaps it was an exceptional case, but just as the secrets of that firm are important to it, so just as important to them are the special knowhow of a hotel keeper who knows how to run his own hotel, or of the salmon net fisher who may have a particular skill in catching salmon in estuaries. It would be equally wrong if those skills were taken over and the profits made from them used to cover up other activities which are not profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment, so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart is a constructive one which I hope the Minister of State will accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I believe that it would be a great advantage to the Bill if a Clause to this effect could be written into it. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) has drawn attention to some of the dangers which may arise if there is not separate accounting of the Board's individual activities. There is the problem of what might be called loss leader activities being swamped in more profitable activities. If separate accounts are not produced, there is the danger that, even if the industrial operations of the Board, the entrepreneurial operations of the Board, are being carried on in a businesslike manner without excessive subsidy, this will not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
thought to be the case by businesses or industries which may find themselves in competition with the operations of the Board. There should be separate accounts as a check on the precise entrepreneurial operations of the Board under Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed this matter on Second Reading I was accused by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) of having no faith in the people of the Highlands, because I suggested that there were many aspects of the Bill which might make it difficult for businesses to continue in the Highlands in the face of unfair competition from the operations of the Board. It was not the people of the Highlands in whom I had no faith. It was hon. Members opposite and members of the Government. I have considerable fears that they may tolerate the Board's carrying on operations which are neither profitable nor likely to become so, but which would be in competition in the Highland area with private enterprise operations which do not have the backing of Government subsidy. This is precisely what the Amendment is designed to control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The nightmares from which hon. Members opposite suffer are absurd. Of course the Board cannot set up in competition with private enterprise, unless it is in the social interest of the Highlands. Even then, it must be approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Secretary of State and the Treasury must approve these operations, but I do not entirely trust the Secretary of State and the Treasury, when they come from the opposite side of the Committee, as a reliable authority to ensure that the Board is not indulging in unsuitable competitive activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State may say that this is an exaggerated example, but I would not be so sure. The type of thing I have in mind is that an my constituency, in the area edging the Highland area, we have recently developed pony trekking operations which have been very successful in attracting tourists. It is possible that at some stage in the future this is the sort of activity which the Board might feel that it wished to get involved in. We make the reasonable request that, if the Board wishes to undertake such an activity,
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
specific accounts should be produced so that we can see that the operation is being conducted on a reasonable, business basis. I cannot see that this is an unreasonable request to make. I therefore hope that the Minister of State will see his way to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one aspect of this matter which is important and which was mentioned in passing by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). I refer to the case where an enterprise run by the Board is running at a commercial loss. This is most important. The type of undertaking which I see the Board carrying on is the kind which private enterprise is unlikely to take on; it is not economic commercially for a private person to do it; but for social reasons it may be in the interests of the area that it should be taken on. When private industry is unable to take it on, and the Board does, and when it is obvious that it may run at a loss, it will require an element of subsidy to keep it going. Unless the Board's operations are to come into disrepute, it is most important that the Board should be able to justify why it is undertaking such an operation and show exactly how the loss is incurred. Having separate accounts for such undertakings would materially assist the Board's work, in that it could justify its undertaking a particular activity. We have one example of this already in the Highlands in the operations of B.E.A. in the Highland Air Services. Although B.E.A. runs at a commercial loss in the Highland and Island areas, I do not think that anyone in the Committee would condemn B.E.A. for incurring this loss. These services have a social nature and they are not altogether commercial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must know the cost of the Board's undertakings and what they are costing the taxpayer in subsidies. It is of great assistance to know what the costs of these things are. For this reason, it is important that separate accounts are produced for the different undertakings, in the same way as B.E.A. in its accounts separates its activities in the Highlands from its activities in other areas. There is, therefore, precedent for this, and I hope that the Minister of State will be prepared to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot accept the Amendment. First, subsection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
(1) gives the Secretary of State and the Treasury ample power to determine the form of the accounts. The Secretary of State will certainly have regard to the need for lucidity and informativeness in the statement of accounts. If Parliament is not satisfied with this, it has means of bringing pressure to bear on the Secretary of State to ensure that it gets the information it requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Amendment would result in the compulsory, obligatory publication of accounts which might, in many cases, be very detailed and very small in nature. Every single little business would have to be accounted for separately, whereas the sensible course might well be to group a number of small businesses forming a fairly homogenous activity. That might be the best way of giving the information required about what is being done by the Board in relation to a number of small undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Amendment is based on the assumption that the Board's activities will be mainly on a profit making basis. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) put the opposite view. He said that the Board's activities would in most cases be on a non-profit making basis, which was all the more reason why we should get this information. In many cases, this would be rather more appropriate for inclusion in the Board's annual reports if it was something of a special character to which public attention should be drawn. The activities of the Board will be mainly of a pioneering, development or rescue nature. Such activities would lend themselves more appropriately to specific mention in the annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, even if these businesses supplied the information asked for in the Amendment, it could well be inaccurate and incomplete, because of the difficulties of sharing the expenditure arising from the central administration of the Board itself. We have had practical experience of this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is so difficult to make the apportionment between the overhead expenses of the Board itself how shall we have any accurate account from the Board of its various branches of activity? The Minister of State has assured us that we shall have accounts related to the different branches of its own business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly they can be got on a larger scale. Some of the industries which the Board might run will be very small indeed. The smaller they are, the more the accounts can be rendered inaccurate by failure to achieve an accurate allocation of central office expenditure. I understand that Highland Home Industries experimented a good deal with trying to allocate central office expenditure. It never did it very successfully. If this operation is not done successfully, it distorts the whole picture which may be given by these very small individual accounts. For all these reasons, the Committee would be advised to reject the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As events turn out, the form of the statement of accounts which the Secretary of State determines will in practice include some of the information, possibly a good deal of the information, which hon. Members opposite seek to make a statutory obligation upon the Board. Much of this information—we think all the necessary information—will be provided in the form determined by the Secretary of State. If it is not, Parliament has ways and means of bringing pressure to bear to see that it is provided. We do not think that we ought to start by putting the Secretary of State and the Board in a straitjacket in this manner by making it compulsory to include the information in the detail suggested by the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of State will reconsider his attitude. The reasons he advanced were not terribly convincing. He did not speak in his normal convincing way. I believe that if he reconsiders the matter he might agree to the Amendment. He presented us with four objections to the Amendment. One was that there would be a great deal of work in preparing detailed accounts, with detailed information. Surely the hon. Gentleman cannot argue that seriously. Surely he does not suggest that the accounts will not be prepared. They will be prepared. They will go to the Board. Some of them might even go to the Minister of State. If the Board is to operate in a sensible way, it will have details of the expenditure, of income and development charges of each separate activity. The information will be there. Why should not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
Members of Parliament have it? Why should not the public be advised of it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason advanced by the Minister of State was that any information given in this way could be misleading. This argument has been used many times to cover up what in many cases amounted to a major scandal. There is a real danger of some runaway losses taking place in one activity and of Members of Parliament and the public not being told about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman will allow that in a case of this kind, where the Board is given wide experimental powers, which I do not think that anybody objects to, it is desirable that it be given a free run for a few years in respect of certain undertakings and that the accounts be considered, taking one year with another over a number of years, rather than that we should encourage every sort of little scandalmonger seeking to expose minor difficulties of the Board in the first year or the second year because the undertakings which it has sponsored do not happen to be showing a profit or even balancing from the very start?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be a serious argument if I had not heard the hon. Gentleman and several of his hon. Friends putting forward exactly the opposite argument at other times.

	<p>A third argument which was advanced was that if Parliament specially wanted it Parliament could demand the information. This is a silly argument. On what basis can we ask for detailed information about projects?

Must we go round prying and snooping, picking up information here and there, and then ask for detailed information? I see no reason why this information should not be published. Certainly the Minister has not given one.</p>
	<p>Another reason was given by the Minister when he intervened in the speech of one of my hon. Friends. He said that it would not be a case of competition with private enterprise. Any body such as this which is set up will be in competition in two respects. First, it will compete with similar industries perhaps in other areas, and to that extent the public interest will be involved. It will also compete for labour in the labour market. This is not our money for us to do what we want with. It is public money entrusted to us. Surely there is a duty on us to make sure that members of the public are advised about how their money is being used and to convince them that it is being used wisely. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this minor Amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That those words be there inserted:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>(3) The accounts of the Board shall be audited by auditors appointed annually by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p>(4) So soon as the accounts of the Board for any financial year have been audited the auditors shall send a copy of the statement of accounts prepared in respect of that year to the Secretary of State, together with a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
copy of any report made by them thereon, and the Secretary of State shall forthwith lay a copy of such statement and report before Parliament.</p>
	<p>This is the Amendment on which our main complaint about the Clause is based. Our complaint is that no independent audit is provided for the Board in this Clause. Under the Bill, the Board is to be treated as if it were a Government Department. This is the kind of audit, to be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which a Department of the Secretary of State would be expected to undergo. The Bill appears to treat the Board as if it were a Department of the Scottish Office. I ask the Minister of State to explain this. It is not normal for a corporate body to be treated in this way. Can he explain why it is proposed to treat it in this way in this Clause?</p>
	<p>I mentioned earlier the example of the Airports Authority Bill. I would also mention the Industrial Training Act, 1964, and, if the Minister wants an example of previous Labour Government administration, the Colonial Development Corporation Act, 1948. The corporate bodies in those Measures are not dealt with as Government Departments, and all have independent audits. I am sure that there are many other examples.</p>
	<p>By subsection (2) of our Amendment, we propose to provide for separate accounts of the Board's main activities. This is similar to the last Amendment which we discussed. It does not go into as much detail as the last Amendment. I therefore hope that our proposed subsection (2) commends itself to the Government and is more acceptable. I listened carefully to the remarks of the Minister of State when he rejected the previous Amendment. I hope that our proposed subsection is in a form which he can accept.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment has a twofold purpose. In subsection (2), it proposes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The form of the accounts and of the statement shall be such as to secure the provision of separate information as respects each of the main activities of the Board."</p></blockquote>
The second purpose is to change the system of auditing of the Board's accounts. Subsection (2) proposes to group together the main activities of the Board. It is not always necessarily advantageous to do this, because the main activities of the Board may change from
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
year to year. One year the main activity might be reclamation; next year, it might be something else. Also, this proposal is not necessarily as meaningful as the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) would seem to indicate. The range of possible activities of the Board is so wide that it might be involved in a multiplicity of developments of a differing character which would not present themselves as "main activities". We must approach the question of grouping with a certain amount of caution. I assume that the hon. Gentleman wants these groupings to be meaningful and not to be misleading. I do not say that it would not be possible to do what he suggests, but it would present difficulties and it probably would not be as simple as he thinks to carry out his suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) of the Clause now says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall keep proper accounts and other records in relation to the accounts and shall prepare in respect of each of their financial years a statement of account in such form as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine."</p></blockquote>
That is pretty flexible. It gives the Secretary of State power to determine the form in which the statement of account is to be prepared and submitted. This enables him to ensure that the accounts are in such a form as to provide, within reasonable limits, an informative and meaningful picture of the Board's activities. I take it that that is what any Secretary of State would desire to do. We should get a much more meaningful picture by leaving it to the Secretary of State to use the powers in subsection (1) than we would by adopting subsection (2) of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that if Parliament wanted certain things made clear in the accounts it would soon demonstrate that to the Secretary of State through the usual Parliamentary channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not that I do not accept the purpose of the Amendment. I am not sure that it would achieve what the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn wishes to achieve. It would probably be better achieved by subsection (1) of the Clause.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
We cannot possibly accept subsections (3) and (4) of the Amendment because they are contrary to the whole basis of accounting appropriate to the Board. The Board is wholly and directly Government financed. It is financed by grants-in-aid which appear in the annual Estimates in the usual manner. As the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn knows, it is not customary to apply the form of audit to grants-in-aid which is applied in the case of the various corporate bodies which he mentioned. The manner in which we propose to handle the auditing of these accounts is in accordance with the general practice relating to grants-in-aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board will, in the main, be wholly and directly Government financed. It will report to the Secretary of State and will have its development proposals approved by him. It will be concerned, in large part, with projects for development, economic and social, and only marginally with the kind of operations for which the accounting arrangements which the hon. Gentleman mentioned would be appropriate. There will be effective Parliamentary control under the Clause, with the Comptroller and Auditor General laying before Parliament copies of accounts, together with reports on them. This is in accordance with the usual procedures of the House. I cannot possibly accept the proposed subsections (3) and (4). Also, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the proposed subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the reason is that this is wholly Government financed, and subject to anything the Minister may say, there are other examples of wholly Government-financed boards having independent audits in this way.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 8, line 29, after "activities", to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or proposed activities, or the activities or proposed activities of other bodies by whom such activities are carried on or are proposed to be carried on on behalf of the Board".</p></blockquote>
There are two points about this Amendment. We suggest that not only the activities but the proposed activities should be included in the information provided under subsection (5) from time to time to the Secretary of State, if he seeks it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that we think the proposed activities of other bodies should also be included. The Government have made a concession in this respect because in Amendment No. 92, in the name of the Minister of State, there is provision for one other body, the Industrial Estates Management Corporation for Scotland, to have its accounts, on matters in which it is working as an agent for the Board, audited under the terms of this Clause. We propose that other bodies, when they are working as agents of the Board, should be included in the terms of subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine that the Minister of State can have any objection to this proposal, which should prove helpful to the Secretary of State. It suggests that the scope of the information should be slightly widened, so I confidently expect that the hon. Gentleman will be able to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment raises two points. The first relates to the proposal that the Secretary of State should have power to obtain from the Board information about its proposed activities as well as its activities. The second refers to the proposal to extend this power to require information of the activities or proposed activities of other bodies undertaking work on behalf of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not certain about the first part of the Amendment being necessary in view of the fact that the Secretary of State will approve proposals by the Board and will have advanced knowledge of the activities. I am prepared to look at the point before Report to see whether anything is necessary or desirable in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
light of what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned Amendment No. 92 in which there is a reference to the Industrial Estates Management Corporation. It is true that the Board will, from time to time, use the services of various bodies, both statutory and non-statutory, as agents. It will be for the Board to work out and agree with such bodies the basis on which services will be given and a proper contractual relationship will be established accordingly. By the nature of things, this will involve the submission to the Board of an accounting by the agent. If the Secretary of State requires information relating to such agency activities, he will require it of the Board which will be under an obligation to provide information regarding its agency work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Amendment is unnecessary. It is difficult to see the point of requiring information about the proposed activities of bodies which will be acting as agencies under the instruction of the Board. We cannot see any reason for that. Obviously they would do so in furtherance of proposals and activities on which they were engaged and which had been approved by the Secretary of State. As I have indicated, however, I am prepared to look at the first point in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, that he will consider the point and look into the matter before Report—I am sorry that his undertaking does not extend to the second part of the Amendment—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 8, line 30, to leave out from "require" to the end of line 34.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause provides that the Board will give to the Secretary of State information relating to activities which he may from time to time require. That is understandable, but it goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…. and for that purpose shall permit any person authorised in that behalf by the Secretary of State to inspect and make copies of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
their accounts, books, documents or papers and shall afford to that person such explanation thereof as he may reasonable require."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Amendment is partly probing, to see what lies behind this. It appears on the face of it as if the Secretary of State is receiving power to check up on the reports made by the Board. If that is to be taken as a reflection either on the integrity or capacity of the Board it would be better left out. If the Board has a statutory obligation to provide reports as the Secretary of State from time to time may require it seems unnecessary to take the further step and to say, "What is more, once we have these reports, or while they are in the course of preparation, I may send someone along to check up on what is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bewildered by the activities of hon. Members opposite during our discussions on this Bill. I never know which side of the fence they are on. At one moment they demand that we must have the most meticulous financial details provided in the statement of accounts. In the next they say, "We do not need to bother about this. You ask for a report, and that is that. You do not need to check it." I am still bewildered. I do not say that in an acrimonious or debating manner but because I am genuinely bewildered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot accept this Amendment. It would remove from the subsection the power given to the Secretary of State to send an authorised officer to inspect and extract from the Board's accounts and other records information relating to its activities. We believe it essential that the Secretary of State should be in a position to check by inspection and audit—I should have thought it would appeal to the hon. Gentleman, who made a forceful speech on the subject a short time ago—on the financial activities of the Board and matters relating thereto. We feel that this is only proper with regard to a Board which is wholely Government financed and in respect of whose activities the Secretary of State is responsible to the House of Commons. For these reasons I hope the Committee will reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our attitude may be explained quite simply. It is one thing
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
to require a Board, which we hope will be a highly responsible body, to provide accounts and, within the accounts, to provide information of its activities. It is quite another for the Secretary of State to give himself the right to send people to make copies of the accounts and inspect the affairs of the Board. It would appear that the Secretary of State has no confidence that the Board will supply the information required. We do not think the Board would withhold, or be dilatory in supplying, information sought under the terms of the Bill, and, therefore, it should not be necessary to have what can only be described as snoopers—I will not say crawling about, because that would be using the Minister's own words—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not refer to snoopers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but making copies. That was our point.

	<li>(6) The provisions of section 10 of the Local Employment Act 1960 (which relates to accounts of Management Corporations) shall not apply to any receipts of or payments by the Industrial Estates Management Corporation for Scotland on behalf of the Board when acting as agent for the Board under section 5(5) of this Act, but the provisions of subsections (7) and (8) of this section shall apply to such receipts or payments.</li>
	<li>(7) The said Corporation shall, in respect of such receipts or payments, keep proper accounts and other records in relation to the accounts and prepare in respect of each financial year and send to the Board a statement of account in such form as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine.</li>
	<li>(8) The provisions of subsections (2) to (4) of this section shall apply to the accounts mentioned in the last foregoing subsection as they apply to the accounts of the Board.</li></div> <!-- ul -->
This Amendment is largely of a technical nature, consequential upon the provision in Clause 5(5) providing that the Board may use the Industrial Estates Management Corporation for Scotland as its agent for the erection of buildings and other operations in regard to land.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
Clause 5(5,	<i>b</i>) ensures that the finances of the Management Corporation, so far as its activities on behalf of the Board are concerned, are kept separate from those relating to activities of the Corporation on behalf of the Board of Trade under the Local Employment Act, 1960. The intention is that the Corporation's activities for the Development Board will be brought within the ambit of accounting and auditing provided in respect of the Development Board under the Bill, and the Amendment gives effect to that intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment does this by making the appropriate adjustments to the provision as to the accounts and audits of the Management Corporation. The new subsection (6) effects separation of the accounting by the Corporation in respect of its Development Board agency activities from the main accounting required of it under Section 10 of the Local Employment Act, 1960. That Section provides for the form of accounts to be determined by the Board of Trade with the consent of the Treasury, and for the channelling of the accounts of all the Management Corporations to the Board of Trade, which thereafter transmits a co-ordinated statement of accounts in respect of activities under the 1960 Act to the Comptroller and Auditor General for examination, certification and presentation to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subsection (7) requires the Corporation to keep proper accounts and other records in relation to the accounts and to prepare an annual statement of account in such form as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine. This is in line with the requirements laid on the Development Board by Clause 13(1). The statement of account is then sent to the Development Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subsection (8) provides that the accounting procedures in subsections (2) to (4) of Clause 13 will apply to the Corporation's accounts, so far AS relating to its activities on behalf of the Development Board. This means that the accounts submitted to the Board by the Corporation in the prescribed form for each financial year will, thereafter, be submitted to the Secretary of State and passed by him to the Comptroller and Auditor General who will be responsible for examining and certifying the accounts

The purpose of these two Amendments, which go together, is to ensure that category approvals can be given not only in respect of matters for which the Secretary of State's approval or consent is required but also in respect of items requiring the approval or consent of,the Secretary of State and the Treasury.

We have already discussed the subject raised by these Amendments when debating earlier Clauses and I assume that by now my hon. Friend the Minister of State has reached certain conclusions about the composition of the Board. I do not, therefore, propose to go over the arguments again in any detail in relation to its composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has spoken about flexibility in the composition of the Board. To assist him in gaining this flexibility my Amendment, No. 115, suggests that one member of the Board should be part-time while all the rest should be full-time. The case regarding the vast tasks ahead of the Development Board has already been deployed. The majority of hon. Members agree that appointments to the Board should be on a full-time basis and that the Board's work should be the responsibility of full-time people. However, some of us are prepared to consider the argument that there should be a little flexibility and that one member of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
Board—someone with, say, exceptional capabilities who may not be able to serve in a full-time capacity—should be able to be appointed. However, there would be only one part-time member and the remaining members would be on a full-time basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to add much to what my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said. Amendment No. 66, which stands in my name, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All Members of the Board shall be full-time."</p></blockquote>
If we are in real earnest about this we must adopt a professional approach and ensure that all the people who are serving on the Board devote all of their time to the task in hand. As an earnest of the intention of the Government to solve, after centuries of neglect, the problems we have been discussing, they should say, "All members of the Board will be full-time, without exception". I appreciate the difficulties which might face the Secretary of State in getting the required number of top-class personnel who would be prepared to do this full-time job unless they were given a guarantee of a specific time period. Obviously they do not want to give up all their business connections unless and until they receive a guarantee of a number of years in this job. That is why I tabled Amendment No. 84—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member consider it convenient to discuss Amendment No. 84, which stands in his name, with the Amendments under discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection, since Amendment No. 84, to page 11, line 15, is to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"4. All appointments to the Board shall be for a maximum initial period of 5 years, renewable at the discretion of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
It might be convenient to have a comprehensive debate on this matter. Since I believe that all the members of the Board should be full-time, five years as an initial period of service would enable the Secretary of State to renew their contracts if they did a good job, in precisely the same way as the Chairman of the National Coal Board is appointed.

I hold strong views on this subject and while the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles provides that the majority of the members of the Board should be full time, I hope that he will agree that his Amendment does not go far enough. I hope, therefore, that he will be prepared to go a little further and agree with me that all the members of the Board should be full-time members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree with the remarks of the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) and I have a similar Amendment on the Paper. I also have Amendment No. 48 on the Notice Paper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Does the hon. Member wish to take Amendment No. 48 at this point as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be convenient, Mr. Steele, because that Amendment is to insert at the end of line 37, on page 11, the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(a)</i> shall pay to the Chairman such remuneration and such allowances, being not less than £10,000 per annum, as the Secretary of State may determine.</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to prolong the discussion because we have debated these matters at considerable length earlier.

The Minister has spoken about the need for flexibility, and the hon. Member for Fife, West remarked that there might be difficulty in finding seven persons of the requisite calibre to serve on the Board. Hon. Members will remember an earlier Amendment of mine which had the object of reducing the number. Despite what the Minister said, I hope that he will realise that the Board will be engaged in a full-time job and will require full-time people to perform it.

I have become increasingly worried, as the Committee has proceeded, about the scale of operations which the Government visualise for the Board. They appear now to be a great deal smaller than one was given the impression they would be before the last Election. This may affect the force of Amendment No. 48. The fact that the Board will not be as large in scope and intention appears to mean—and I do not know what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) seems puzzled about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman proceeds, may I point out that while he is suggesting that the powers of the Board are not as wide or as large as one might have assumed before the Election, that does not altogether seem to be the, case? His views on this alarm me, because I have been lea to believe by my hon. Friend the Minister of State that the Board's powers will be even larger and wider than I had hoped they would be—and I had hoped that they would be very large and wide indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan made any point there. He merely said what he thought. I think that the Board was visualised in the first place as being a body with a great deal more money in its hands than it now appears it will have. If it were visualised as an important body then, clearly, full-time members operating it would be absolutely necessary, but now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
