	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(ESTABLISHMENT OF HIGHLAND DEVELOPMENT BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [25th March],</i> In page 1, line 25, leave out subsection (4) and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) The Board shall consist of not more than seven members elected by the local government electors for the said area in accordance with rules to be made by the Secretary of State and in making such rules the Secretary of State shall have regard to the population, the distribution and pursuits of the population, the geographical character and the local government boundaries of the several parts of the area, and such other circumstances which appear to him to affect the matter.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Such rules shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be of no effect unless it is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament, and the power to make such rules includes power to vary or revoke them by a subsequent statutory instrument.—	<i>[Mr. Hendry.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call on the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) I would say that it would be advisable to discuss now also the Government Amendment to the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that remains for me to say is that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) deservedly had a bad Press for the absurd and time-wasting Amendment which he moved at our last meeting. I have nothing more to say on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Amendment by which it is sought to allow the Board to appoint its own deputy chairman, I have no very strong feelings, but I believe it deserves consideration, but the Secretary of State should appoint the deputy chairman for the reason that I stated on Thursday
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
morning, which is to ensure that both the chairman and the deputy chairman represent the balancing interests, as it were, on the Board. To ensure this being done I would prefer the position to be in the hands of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it might be convenient if I were now to answer the Amendments which have been moved. The first of them is in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). I do not know whether the hon. Member intended the Amendment seriously or whether he put it down simply as a peg on which to hang a few of the phrases which he used on Thursday morning. If he moved it seriously, it indicates that he completely misunderstands the purpose and the function of the proposed Highland Development Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board has a job of work to do. It will be a full-time body and will be given specific executive responsibility. The type of person we want is, therefore, one capable of doing this work. By electing these persons, we would not ensure that we got the right type. We might get seven schoolmasters—not that there is anything wrong with schoolteachers. We might get seven members of the women's rural institutes—not that there is anything wrong with them. They do a very fine job of work in their own sphere, but this is not their sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman does in the Amendment is to propose a new form of regional government. If he wants that, the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill is not the Bill by which he should introduce it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will, no doubt, appreciate that teachers do a full-time job of work and that a teacher will be in control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very true at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am suggesting is that we might get people who are admirable in their professions and who might not be admirable at performing this job. We need people on the Board who, we think, can do the job, and that must not be left to the process of election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
The second Amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). I accept his argument that his wording is probably better than the wording of the Bill. I would be prepared to accept the wording of his Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not prepared to accept his limitation on the number of members of the Board, apart from the chairman, to four. What I am now saying will serve as an answer to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). The Clause says that the Board shall consist of a chairman plus not more than six other members. In our discussions we felt that the right number would be four or five members, which is what is suggested by the hon. Member for Inverness, but we also realised that, although we want all the members of the Board to be full-time, this might not be possible. It might be that we would get the part-time services of somebody who could do a very fine job. If those services were more than half-time, that person might be a very useful member to appoint to the Board. We want full-time members; that is our aim and object; but we might have to take somebody part-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet canvassed the field for membership properly and we are not yet fully cognizant of its possibilities. We ought to have flexibility. If we get full-time members, we would expect the Board to have four or five members. If we get the services of part-time members we might want to go up to seven. It would depend on the kind of services. We want the Secretary of State to have a certain amount of room in which to move. My right hon. Friend pointed this out in his Second Reading speech, when he said that he wanted elbow room. For these reasons it is better to keep the number seven, as it is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These arguments will apply to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles. He would compel us to appoint seven members to the Board but we do not want to have to do so unless that is necessary. If we can get the job done with five, we would prefer to appoint five full-time members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the full-time membership of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
the Board. How can my hon. Friend argue for five members? Is he saying that the five will definitely be full-time members? Will that be written into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. Out of the five there might be four full-time members and one part-time. It might be possible to have three or four full-time members. Suppose we are faced with a choice between two men, one who is very good but cannot give us all of his time, and another, who is nowhere near as good but who can give us the whole of his time. That is the kind of situation which might face the Secretary of State when appointing the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's argument very fully, but I have had experience in the Highlands with boards of this kind. The great difficulty about part-time members is that their other commitments take priority and the business of the board becomes secondary. We shall try to appoint full-time people who will devote the whole of their intelligence and capabilities to this one job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We appreciate the strength of that argument, but we appreciate also that we might have somebody who can do a first-class job of work but might not be able to give us the whole of his time. We would expect him to give us well over half his time. His main job would be the work of the Board in terms of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we suggested seven members, to allow the Secretary of State a choice, and to enable us to select what we think to be the best Board possible. We appreciate the necessity of as much full-time employment as possible. We are in earnest about this, and it is symbolic of our earnestness that we want to appoint full-time people; but we want a degree of flexibility left in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last Amendment, in the name of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) would mean that the Board would select its deputy chairman. It is not the usual practice to put this into a Statute. It is nearly always done by the Secretary of State, for the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for West Fife (Mr. William Hamilton), namely, that at the end of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
the day, the Secretary of State is responsible to Parliament for the Board and its activities. That is the point of responsibility between the Board and, if you like, the electorate, through the House of Commons. Quite clearly, the Secretary of State ought to have some say on the appointment of the chairman and the deputy chairman because, at some period of time, the deputy chairman might be called upon to fulfil the chairman's duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully. The Secretary of State will have appointed the Board, and he will have fulfilled his responsibility to Parliament, I would have thought, in seeing that the Board consisted of suitable people. I do not quite see how the Secretary of State increases his effective action in Parliament by choosing the deputy chairman as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This applies to the chairman too, of course. He is the link between the Board and the Secretary of State. The chairman of a board has dual responsibility—to his board and to the Secretary of State. That is the responsibility in boards already set up and how it is defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State is to accept responsibility for what is being done by the board, then he is the point of responsibility to the House of Commons. It seems reasonable, and previous Governments of all parties have taken the same line. If that is so, then the Secretary of State should appoint the chairman and, I should think, the deputy-chairman. This is well precedented. I understand that the general rule has been that the Secretary of State appoints the vice-chairman as well in consultation with the chairman. That is general practice. Even in appointments to the board the Secretary of State will probably consult the chairman about the suitability of certain members. Of course, the Secretary of State has the final say, but, in practice, he does it in consultation with the chairman because the chairman must work with the vice-chairman and is able to say whether or not a particular person is acceptable to the board in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the process. We would prefer to leave this degree of responsibility with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
the Secretary of State, as has been done in the case of almost every other board, with one exception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. A. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman give particulars? Which is the exception?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as we can find out, there is only one case in which an exception has been made. There are a number of precedents for the Secretary of State making the appointment. One of those precedents is the Cereals Marketing Board which we are now setting up. The hon. Member sat on the Standing Committee considering the Cereals Marketing Bill but did not raise this point then. The Cereals Marketing, Sea Fish, Industrial Training and Harbours Boards all have vice-chairmen whose appointments are made by the Ministers responsible. The exception is the Airports Authority. The Minister there appoints the Vice-Chairman after consultation with the Chairman. We prefer to maintain the generally accepted principle operated by both Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. When an Amendment is good and it is difficult to find a logical argument against it, it is customary here and elsewhere to suggest that it should not be taken seriously. That cannot be the case with this Amendment, however, as can be seen from the fact that out of over 70 Amendments on the Notice Paper this is one of the few attracting no fewer than four names. If proof were needed that this is a serious Amendment, it is found in the names of the sponsors. What is significant is the rather unusual criticism voiced against it. I wondered if my ears deceived me when I heard the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) saying that he regretted the Amendment as time wasting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not say anything to the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) at the time, but I do not want this kind of criticism to continue, because it is criticism of the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully support you in that contention, Mr. Steele. That is why I voiced the suggestion. If there is one person who should not make such a criticism, it is the hon. Member for Fife, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
Another criticism by the Minister of State was his suggestion that democracy would not be able to choose as good a Board as the Secretary of State. This is a trend becoming wider. The Government seem to have lost faith in democracy in almost all their activities. We have had boards, commissions and councils set up to consider many subjects and almost all have been appointed by the Government. That is not the right way to achieve efficiency in democracy. Democracy is the best way of choosing the best people to do a job in the best way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look at the kind of people normally chosen to serve on a commission or board. The Government are not choosing from a wide range of people with a diversity of talent. A new class is being established—those who serve on boards, commissions and councils. They generally tend to be university lecturers of radical opinions, business executives who have not very much time to devote to the work, and retired trade union officials. We are not getting for this work the broad range of talent we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way of getting the right people is by the normal process of democracy. The need for people with knowledge of special subjects is covered by the constitution of the Board. Not only is the Board to be appointed by the Secretary of State but he will also appoint the Consultative Council. The best way to preserve the influence of the experts is to have an elected Board served by a Council nominated by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is putting an interesting case for democratic election. I presume that he knows about the Highlands and the social conditions there. I know something about them. I am aware of the feeling in the area that they would not like this work to be circumscribed in the way the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. Perhaps, however, the hon. Gentleman has his own information about the Highlands. If he has, he should say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the usual arguments against democracy is that people are not perhaps in a position to use the democratic process and are not in a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
position to select the right people available. I agree that recent election results in the Highlands might make one tend to lose faith in democracy, but this should not destroy our feeling that democracy is the best way to get the best results and the right men to do the right job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) for the kind welcome he gave me when I attended the Committee for the first time last week. As he is aware, I am serving on another Committee as well, and I am anxious to do my duty there and put the radical view, as no Liberal Member is present there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Bence </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go to that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —confine his remarks to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, Mr. Steele. I am convinced that, once he considers the Amendment, every hon. Member will feel that we should accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment refers only to the Board itself. It does not refer to the Council also to be appointed by the Secretary of State. The right way to ensure that the democratic element is maintained while ensuring that sufficient so-called experts are available to the Board is to have the Board elected by the people and guided by an appointed body of experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first and obvious argument for the Amendment is that of democracy. An authority not elected by the people and whose authority does not stem from them tends to get out of touch with the interests of the people. Time and again, appointed boards tend to get out of touch with the interests of the people. They have an enormous job to do and spend their time in committee rooms looking at maps instead of keeping in touch with the people. The strength of the democratic system is that, from time to time, elected representatives must report their doings and set out lines of future policy. If we do not have even certain members of the new Board elected, there will be a danger of the Board getting off to a flying start but ending in stagnation, like so many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
Another factor is the kind of person we want on such a Board. We must have men of independent minds and who are prepared to stand up for their views. If members are appointed by the Secretary of State, are given general directions on policy by him and are subject to dismissal by him, we shall not have any hope of getting independent-minded men and new policies. We want the Board to be successful. If its members are to be so completely subject to the Secretary of State the job will not be done as well as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board will have to work closely with local government and other elected bodies in the Highlands. Unless it has elected members who are fully aware of the scope and nature of local government the Board cannot hope to be successful. What will happen in the event of a clash between the two interests? What if the Board wants to follow a policy which is opposed by local government? Is the Secretary of State to stand up for the Board against democratic local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what body of the community is the hon. Member to draw his candidates for the Board? Would anyone be able to stand? How will they be sponsored? Would members be elected every two, three or five years? Would a candidate have to put up £150 deposit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into this. Once the Committee agrees with the general principle it can get down to detail. I should be glad to go into detail when the principle is agreed. People should be glad to stand for election to the Board as individuals if they wish. I am sure there are sufficient people who would do work of this sort but who cannot do the normal local government work because of the financial circumstances. There are many people in the country of the right calibre for the position of chair man who would only be too glad to serve on this body so long as—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be preferable if we were to allow this debate to proceed in an orderly manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just exercise the normal rights of an hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
through you, Mr. Steele, and ask the hon. Gentleman to elucidate what is the vital point in the whole of his argument? Does he really mean that this is to be a free for all, that anyone can stand, that there are no conditions, that 1,000 candidates can come along for seven posts? Is that the meaning of what he is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. Obviously there will be the normal restraints preventing cranks from standing. We should only have people putting themselves forward if they were prepared to stand and had a chance of being elected. I do not see why the hon. Gentleman is finding disadvantages in democracy. I believe the way I am suggesting is the best way to get the right people to do the job, although I am not prepared to say that in no circumstances would an appointed board not better serve a purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) may have been inadvertently diverting me from the fundamental point. What happens if the appointed Board clashes with the interests and objectives of the democratically elected local government? There would be a storm and the Secretary of State would have to step in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order: I think we should confine ourselves to the Amendment. We have sufficient scope in that without dealing with hypothetical matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest, Mr. Steele, that this is a fundamental argument in favour of the Amendment in that it deals with the circumstances—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is arguing that it should be an elected Board. I think he ought to confine himself to that, not to the possibilities of what might happen after they are elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly argue from that direction. If we had an elected body whose interests conflicted in some way with those of the elected local government, and their policies were dissimilar, the Secretary of State would be quite entitled to step in. No one would object, as his authority stems from the elective principle. This could not happen unless we were prepared to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
accept the Amendment and its consequences. However, if the Board were appointed, he would have to intervene between a locally elected body and his own appointed body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested by certain hon. Members and particularly by the hon. Member for Fife, West, that in doing this we are making or appearing to make a step towards elected regional government. I do not have a closed mind on this subject and the functions which we are to give to the Board may be functions which could more properly be carried by an elected regional government instead of the proliferation of town councils and county councils and the like. This is a first step in what might be an interesting experiment. This is not the establishment of regional government, but it indicates that we are interested in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to consider the essential point of how we can get the best men to do the job. To get the best men we must ensure they have the right authority, and that stems not simply from the appointment of people who are interested in the subject. How is one individual to decide who is the right person and what is the right policy to be pursued in the long term? The only principle we can reasonably adopt is the electoral system. We should not concern ourselves with getting the correct balance of experts, as we shall have that balance on the Consultative Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with 99 per cent. of the Minister's remarks in reply, but there is one point on which I would like to press him further and it concerns the Amendment with which I am associated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to pursue the argument from which the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has fled. I noticed the smile on the face of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) as he felt he could not sustain the argument further and therefore decided to leave the Committee. There was a smile on his face as he went through the door. We may not pursue the remark which the hon. Gentleman made earlier and which the Chairman in his wisdom has refused to accept as one fit to be used in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
The issue is whether or not we are going to elect or select a body of men for a particular purpose. If the Board is created by individuals who submit themselves for chance election a chance creation will result. In deciding whether it should be an election or selection we have to think about what this body has to do for the Highlands. As this aspect of its work is in Clause 3 I cannot address myself to it. In that Clause is buried the Highlands which I hope will be unearthed and whose future we shall know more about when we come to its conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The type of Highlands I visualise cannot be created by the chance election of the Board. I agree with the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) when he said that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board must be composed of highly skilled and professional experts who know about industry, agriculture, transport and administration …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25th March, 1965; c. 92.]</p></blockquote>
These men can only be selected, and one individual must make the choice. That individual would be subject to criticism if he made the wrong choice. Should he make the wrong choice he can rectify the error, but if the wrong choice is made by election no rectification is possible till the next election. This is the sort of fatalistic aura which clings to elections in these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) said that if the Secretary of State had power to select he could also dismiss. That argument operates also with the election principle. Everyone elected or selected is subject to dismissal. Dismissal is not something which disappears by adopting the elective principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore as we must select, the method we adopt has become important. My Amendment suggests that the Board should not be more than six plus the chairman although the Minister has rejected this. He argues that there must be flexibility of choice because, I assume, the Secretary of State believes that in the whole of Scotland he could not find more than four possible members for this Board, and he will go ahead with four members and a chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
I hope the difficulty which might reside in getting a board of four will not reside in getting a chairman. If he cannot find a chairman in the whole of Scotland he will have much greater difficulty in finding six members for the Board. I do not think the Minister really accepts that argument, as Scotland is sufficiently rich in men who know about agriculture, administration, transport and industry. Scotland is sufficiently rich in qualitative people to ensure that the Secretary of State would have no difficulty in getting six members for the Board. A continual complaint in Scotland is that here is insufficient scope for Scottish talent which is steadily filtering South and abroad where whole industries are directed and administered by Scottish people, trained and educated in Scottish educational institutions. Yearly we are losing these men from Scotland and from among them could easily be found the six necessary peole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Secretary of State can argue that if he cannot get six people but only four he can go ahead. In fact he can go ahead with only three. It would be unwise to proceed with the minimum number and allow others to come in later. It is important that the Board should start as a fully completed body so that from the beginning it operates as a fully constituted body, dealing with all the problems associated with the development of the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend to think again about this, and not to reject the idea of a Board consisting of a chairman and six members; not more and not less than that number. I press on him that he should not reach a final conclusion, but should give the matter further thought. When he has done so, I hope he will conclude that the number of the Board should be fixed from the beginning and that he will not handicap himself by delaying the creation of the complete Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue this subject a little further, because I am always anxious to do my best to strike a blow for democracy. Prejudice against democracy is not confined to political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), when he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
implied that it was the chancey nature of elections which made it far better to select than to elect members of the Board to do this important work, was questionable. It is a strange argument when we, Members of Parliament, have been elected to run the country. What is the difference between running the country as elected Members of Parliament and having elected members of a Board to develop and expand a part of the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not make a general argument out of a particular case. We are dealing with a Board which has certain jobs to do. Parliament's job is entirely different, and the method of electing Members of Parliament is absolutely justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that; but if Members of Parliament can be elected for such responsible jobs for the good of the country it is at least arguable that we should consider the same principle of choice of men for running part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many people who are increasingly disappointed about Government-appointed boards for definite industries or definite jobs. We all know examples of that. If a board is elected, at least the people directly concerned have a chance of having some say in the sort of people they want to have on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman apply that principle to the election of the headmaster of a secondary school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought to deal with Government boards, because that is the subject under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can go too far with the idea that there are just a few high-powered people who know best what to do for the sake of others, how to run their businesses, how to develop their industries and how to develop their communities, not taking enough account of the feelings of those concerned. One great advantage of the principle of an elected board as opposed to an appointed board, appointed over the heads of the people, is that by the former we ensure from the start the involvement of the people in the board's work, and one of the necessities in the Highlands is the involvement of people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
in the work of the Board, for without that involvement the Board will never really succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been astonished by the arguments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon). They are suggesting a third degree of democratically elected bodies. In other words, they say that in addition to locally elected and nationally elected representatives we ought to have a body which is regionally elected. It is rather strange that, although hon. Members opposite have been the Government for thirteen years and have appointed all sorts of boards in that time, they have never suggested that one should be democratically elected in this way. I do not know what sudden change there has been since last October. My belief is that they are trying to cash in on what they believe to have happened in the recent by-election in the Borders and are suggesting handing back power to people who in fact already have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart made another of his statements which do not bear examination. He said that boards of this type were composed almost entirely of trade union organisers, businessmen without executive responsibility, and university people with radical ideas. I have been a member of a number of boards of this type and I can honestly say that by no stretch of the imagination could they be said to be composed of groups like that. For the most part they are composed of ex-members of local authorities, for example, ex-Lord Provosts of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and so on, retired civil servants, and civil servants who have not retired, local authority officers retired and still serving. Invariably when there are businessmen they have executive responsibility. The hon. Gentleman was well off the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt have observed, as I did, that the Minister of State said that in his view the great majority of this small Board would probably be full-time. How does that fit in with his suggestion about the composition of the Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On quite a number of these boards the chairman is full-time while the members are part-time. I do not see that that makes the slightest difference. The point is that when the hon. Gentleman's own party was in power it felt that the kind of people I have mentioned were those best fitted for these jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Member for Cathcart really believe that if a body of this kind were democratically elected the ex-Lord Provost of Edinburgh, for example, would permit his name to go forward for election to the Board, that he would go canvassing for a job of this kind? Would a retired civil servant? Without exception the sort of people required for the Board would not allow their names to go forward for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another and more important issue is, who supplies the finance? Is there anybody who supplies the finance for a project and then relinquishes all control over how the money is spent? This is what would happen and there should be no mistake about it. If we were to have a regionally elected body to run the Highlands the money would be supplied by the Government and that would be the last that the Government would have to do with it. It would have to be left to the Board to spend the money as it liked—otherwise there would be no point in electing the members of the Board. If the Secretary of State had to approve every decision taken by the Board there would be no point in having elections. The board suggested by hon. Members opposite bears no relation to any body, privately or publicly run, for there is nobody who would finance a board of this kind and then hand over the spending of the money to someone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East said that the public would be disappointed with the Board. However, as I said last Thursday, we have a board of this kind already operating in the Highlands—the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board which has done more for the Highlands than any publicly elected body. If hon. Members want proof of this let me recall that I attended a meeting in Perth when an attempt was made to do away with the Hydro-Electric Board, and when it was suggested that the two Scottish electricity Boards should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
amalgamated, and when there was an outcry from every member of the Highlands who was present demanding that in no circumstances should the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board be done away with because it was the only body which had ever done anything for the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I completely agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said about the work of the Hydro-Electric Board, I should point out that only three of its Highland members come from the Highland area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be, but that does not affect whether we should allow the Board to be elected and then to spend the money provided by the Government, or whether the Board should be appointed by someone who is under the control of Parliament whose Members have been elected. The Secretary of State may not always select the best people and might not select enough from a particular area, but what we are discussing now is not the individual members of the Board but how the Board is to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have a third kind of democracy, regional as well as local and national, we shall find ourselves in a very sad way. It will not be long before other regions demand the same thing, and it will not be long after that before they say that the money provided must be divided among them according to population. When that happens, we can say goodbye to any development in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members must face the logical sequence of events which would follow from what they suggest. Taking into account the initial difficulties of drawing up electoral boundaries and electoral rolls and running elections, and the waste of time which all those things entail, at the end of the day we should find that the Highlands would not be developed for a very long time. We want to get on with the job, and experience has proved that the best way to do that is to have a Board of the kind which the Government have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not certain whether it was the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart or the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East who took up the argument that the best means of representing people was through a representative election. It was suggested that the best kind of board one could have was a board which was representative. I personally do not regard myself as the best vehicle to undertake a technical job of development and I certainly do not believe that the best means of staffing a board which is bound to be involved in highly technical work is to elect the members of it. This argument does not hold water. I am surprised that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart has not suggested that we should democratise everything, including local government, by electing the county planning officer, the development officer, the county clerk and everybody else. That would be the logical follow through of his argument and, as I say, it does not hold water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for having accepted my Amendment, although I am rather sorry that he has refused to reduce the number involved. I listened to him carefully when he adduced the argument about flexibility and the need to have a degree of come and go one way and the other. I am not altogether sure that I completely accept his argument, for suppose that, as he said, one wanted to obtain the services of a certain person who was unable to give his full time and full attention to this work. I should have thought that there could be some method devised whereby such a person could be seconded from and could work through, say, one of the existing bodies within the Highland area. The Minister appeared to me to be envisaging circumstances in which a person with specialised knowledge might be wanted. I suggest that it would be better to have him operating through the Crofters Commission or the Department of Agriculture or any of the other existing bodies so that his services would be available in that way. As to the argument of the Board being comprised of full-time members, consider, for example, the Tennessee Valley Authority. It was a three man body and has proven to be extremely successful in its work. It was extremely small, but perhaps its smallness was its strength in certain respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
I am, therefore, not altogether happy with the argument adduced by the Minister on this score and I hope that he will make clear what he meant when he referred to wanting five full-time members. I am not certain I accept the need for two more places for part-time people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever else my Amendment has done it has certainly caused a great deal of interest. In fact, I would almost say that it has disturbed a wasps' nest. Anyone who disturbs a wasps' nest is likely to be stung, and as an hon. Member opposite said, I have probably been stung as a result of my Amendment, but I do not regret that because if one has a wasps' nest in one's garden it must be eradicated. That is what I have tried to do, even at the risk of being stung.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do believe hon. Members opposite distrust democracy. We have had a strong protest from hon. Gentlemen opposite, who I do not believe have done justice to their argument about democracy. We are all elected Members of Parliament. We are sent here as a result of democratic elections, but I feel that the hostility towards the Amendment on the part of hon. Gentlemen opposite is partly due to a fear of democracy and partly because this country has been brought to a frame of mind in which we rather tend to forget our democratic principles and set out to set up super boards and so on to rule us. That is an extremely serious situation. We are faced here with a serious situation indeed when the democracy of this country is being eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister should suggest that I was not serious when moving my Amendment. I was deadly serious because we are faced with a deadly serious situation, and it is our duty to warn the House of Commons, the Committee and the country of what we are likely to run up against if we go in for much more of this sort of thing, especially if the Bill is, as we have been given to understand, the prototype for the establishment of other boards in other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the boards which have been set up in great numbers in recent years are a new-fangled convention. We got on very well for many centuries, particularly during the last

century, with elected bodies, whether at national or local level. I defy any hon. Member to say that our county and town councils have not done a good job in looking alter local interests. The members of our town and county councils have been elected by the people and, from the point of view of technicalities, they have been guided by specialised officials who advise and carry out the executive decisions made by the members of our town and county councils. Bearing this in mind, it is beyond me to see why a board such as that proposed under the Bill should not be established in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past we have had various commercial enterprises conducted by local authorities, some of which have been mentioned and some of which have not. The gas industry is now run by a nationalised board appointed by the Government, but for many years, for almost a century, that industry was, by and large, run by local authorities. I do not believe that any hon. Member will suggest that, for example, Glasgow Corporation did not run a highly successful gas undertaking or that it would have been better run by some sort of 	<i>ad hoc</i> authority which—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman appears not to have heard of it. I thought that since he had mentioned Glasgow he would know about it because it is only eight miles from Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman any information about that. The point of my argument is that Glasgow Corporation, a locally elected authority, ran a very successful gas industry for many years, as did many other local authorities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then consider electricity. That industry was run and developed by local authorities and I suggest—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—that since Aberdeen and other corporations ran electricity industries in their localities with the greatest efficiency known at that time—and I am not denying that, because of developments, it was desirable to nationalise the industry—we should remember that properly elected authorities are able to do this sort of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will realise that this is not quite fair. Why is it, Mr. Steele, that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was listening very carefully to what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was showing that proper elected bodies are quite capable of running industries of this sort.

Since electricity, water, gas and so on require technical assistance and advice from officials and officers, people with such qualifications have been employed by these bodies and that is how I envisage the operations of the Highland Development Board. Whether its members are appointed or elected this body will, in the course of time, form a corps of highly skilled technical officials. We see what has happened in the new town corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately—and I advisedly use the word "unfortunately"—they have been nominated by the Secretary of State, although it has always been understood that the new town corporations should, as soon as possible, hand over their responsibilities to a town council. This has taken place in one place in Scotland. These corporations do not deal with the day to day details which arise. They appoint a general manager and I envisage

the Board we are considering doing the same, whether its members are appointed or elected. It does not seem to me to have any relevance to the final ability of the Board whether it is elected or nominated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seriously concerned about this matter. Reference has been made to the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, which is another nominated board, and I am surprised that the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), who has so little faith in the Highlands and the people of the Highlands, should boast of the fact that only three members of that Board live in the Highland area. Does he distrust the Highlanders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite wrong. I did not boast about it, but was merely pointing out to the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), who was at the time adducing an argument about the Hydro-Electric Board, that only three members of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board live in the Highland area. However, I regretted that fact. It is a criticism of mine and I was certainly not boasting about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman therefore agrees that it would be a very good thing if the Hydro-Electric Board were elected by Highlanders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the hon. Member's Amendment. The hon. Member accused me, at the last meeting of this Committee, of blethering. It seems to be characteristic of fledgling hon. Members of these Committees to come in and talk like that about other hon. Members. That has happened before. By the time he has been here a little longer I hope he will not be behaving in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, he is here as a democrat and I think he will agree with me that the collective wisdom of the Committee is greater than the wisdom of any individual member of it. In his two speeches he seemed to me completely to have forgotten his Liberal principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member now putting forward the theory that the total is not greater than the sum of its parts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That surely is endemic in democracy, that the collective wisdom

of the Committee is greater than the wisdom of any individual member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Member account, then, for the act of the Gadarene swine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the speeches of the hon. Member for Inverness, it seems to me that he has forgotten his Liberal principles. He has forgotten the principles laid down by the great architects of the Liberal Party in the past. They must be squirming in their graves at his criticism of democracy. Mr. Gladstone, and other leaders of the Liberal Party, if they could hear the negation of democracy that passes for Liberalism in this day and age—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Gladstone was not likely to have been a Member of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Steele, but these are the people who laid down the basis of democracy and they would be completely horrified to hear some of the views that have come from the hon. Gentleman. I suggest that he reads up the history of the Liberal Party and then tries to act as a true Liberal and not as a pseudo-Liberal who has completely forgotten his Liberal principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) was critical of me. I regard it as a very great compliment that he regards me as only rather stupid. His views and opinions and mine are completely different. He is so estranged from democracy and its ideals that his ideas and mine have nothing in common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) made a speech which showed his complete lack of understanding of the position. He spoke about the County Councils Association, the Convention of Royal Burghs and other such bodies. He does not seem to realise that these are not local authorities but are local authority organisations. They are not nominated or elected bodies but merely federations or trade unions of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister of State has a great deal of sympathy with what I have been saying, because he has always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
been a true democrat at heart. The only argument he used against my Amendment was that it was not serious. I regard it as a very serious Amendment, and I now ask the Minister of State a very direct question. If the Secretary of State or he appoints this Board, consisting of supermen, who are these to be? Where will the Secretary of State find these supermen who will serve on the Board? We do not know what we are to get. These people are to be appointed to the Board by the Secretary of State and at the will of the Secretary of State. They can be sacked from the Board by the Secretary of State if he does not consider them suitable. We are entitled to know where these people are to come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are they to be Highlanders? If not, has the Minister of State any faith in the Highlanders? If he has, why does he not allow Highlanders to elect their representatives? They would be representative of the people to be governed, and if they do not produce what the Highlands want they would have opportunity at a later stage of putting the matter right by electing other people. Are the Highlanders to get this opportunity of looking themselves or are they not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the full-time members of this Board to do the actual day-to-day work? Is the Secretary of State proposing to allow them to appoint staff to do it? If so, will the members of the Board be fulfilling their function? Why does the Secretary of State think that the nominees will do better than democratically elected members? We are entitled to know. We want the collective voice of democracy, which we believe will be wiser than any individual voice of any individual member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Secretary of State for Scotland frightened that elected members might be Liberals? Does he envisage that the members of the Board will be trade union officials as on other Scottish Boards? If not, who are they to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will give me a very much fuller answer than merely to suggest that my Amendment was not to be taken seriously. I have never been more serious in my life because the foundations of democracy in this country are being eroded slowly day by day and month by month. In the past
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
twenty years we have seen a multiplicity of these boards appointed by Governments, consisting of supermen. We are in danger of losing our democratic system. I, for one, will never lie down under the threat of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not, like some hon. Members, going to call that hon. Member stupid. He has now made that unnecessary. The hon. Member has again given us his reasons for his Amendment and has referred frequently to democracy. His arguments, however, appear to have even less substance than those he employed when he first moved his Amendment. He suggested that only Highlanders should be elected to the proposed Board, but I would point out that the Highlanders have not asked for it; they certainly have not asked for what he proposes in this Amendment. I am quite sure that the Highlanders generally are not asking for anything remotely like this. The hon. Member is not speaking for the Highlanders or for anybody that I know in the Highlands. It is not necessary for the Highlanders to be asked to elect this Board. It is true that sufficient people of suitable capacity are available in the Highlands to do the work of the Board, and there is no reason why the Secretary of State should not be able to find them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member, and his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) have both spoken very fervently in favour of the Amendment and in favour of a Board, democratically elected by local government electors only: but for them to talk in this way is humbug. Half the Tory Party's strength is in the wholly unelected House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely they are aware also that the Tory Party in Scotland have only recently appointed regional organisers. The party membership did not elect them; the party chiefs appointed them. Above all, they showed what real democrats they are by the way they appointed the present Parliamentary Leader of their party. They did not, of course, elect him in any sense: he descended upon them from another place. And what a wallop hit them when he did land. Yet they come here and talk about elections and true grass-roots and democracy. They really were talking an awful lot of tommyrot this morning.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
I am not by any means underrating the value of local government or local electors; but this is not their job and it is not a job that they would do well. They are not the right people to do it at all and would not claim to be. If the Secretary of State will look around very carefully and take his time about it I am sure that he will be able to get the right numbers and quality of full-time people in the Highlands to do this job. My hon. Friend the Minister of State said that he wanted full-time people. I hope that he and the Secretary of State will make clear and firm decisions on this point and make sure they are to be seven full-time members; and make this clear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that seven is the better number because it has certain advantages as being likely to be more representative. When I heard the figure five, and even a possible four—some, perhaps, part-time members—I began to worry. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will put away any thought either of having part-time members or of having only four or five members on the Board. For example, to have three part-time members sitting as a quorum— which could happen as the Bill reads now—would be wholly undesirable, and in time the situation would become unworkable if repeated too often. Yet it could happen under the arrangements contemplated on the strict reading of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Secretary of State will appoint all full-time members to the Board and that the number chosen will be seven. I am almost sure that is the mind of this Committee as well. I do not think that there will be any fundamental difference in the Committee in this respect. I hope that he will choose his seven people in due course and that they will get on full-time with the job. This is what the Highland people are waiting for. They want members with the right qualification to give their full time to the job, a vast job in a vast area. Of course, the Board will need a lot of help; but there will be any amount of advice; and that advice should be available at its own request as needed, and should not be passed down to it more or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
less as the instructions of an outside body. That problem arises in Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not lay the same emphasis as some other hon. Members on the importance of "supermen". I want a good Board. I do not want a Board dominated by a superman, whether he be the Secretary of State in Edinburgh, the Board's own chairman, or anyone else. I hope, however, that my right hon. Friend will not be afraid to appoint men who are not afraid of him, men of vision and challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that, for the Board, the right people must be picked without considerations of political party. I hope, however, that there will be fair representation in the Consultative Council of all interests including, as far as is practicable, representation of the Labour and Conservative and Liberal Parties in the Highlands. We must also have regard to territorial selection on the Consultative body. But, on the Board itself, what we want is a good team. We do not need "supermen". All these much-boosted big names have weaknesses, too. I have met some of them; and, while they are excellent in their own special jobs, they are not necessarily the best people to do the kind of job we want done in the Highlands by the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member not agree that as the Bill is drafted the Secretary of State is cast rather for the role of superman with all these references—55 or so—to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is a representative of Parliament and the Government. Any Board must be answerable to Parliament, which is elected to represent and safeguard the interests of the nation and which must decide on the suitability of members of the Board and whether their work is proceeding according to the policy of the Government of the day. That is something we cannot escape and should not attempt to escape. We are all elected Members of the House of Commons—the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) as much as anyone else—for better or worse. The Secretary of State is ultimately ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Secretary of State will really want to exercise powerful dominance day by day over the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
Board; but he must be responsible to the House for the success or failure of the Board and to make changes to meet changing situations facing the Board and generally guide its activities. The Board's work must be within the context of national economic planning, and within the broad Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do agree, however, that we do not want the Secretary of State coming in at every point and telling the Board in detail what must be done day by day or even month by month or even year by year in certain respects. I hope that my right hon. Friend will allow the Board a very free rein.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member please tell us whether he envisages that the Secretary of State will answer in Parliament for the Board by means of Parliamentary Questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is always answerable to the House. I merely say that the Secretary of State should not interfere in the day to day operational activities of the Board. That would surely contradict everything that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West believes in, according to certain of his own Amendments. I assume that the hon. Gentleman would not want the Secretary of State answering all sorts of detailed questions on the day to day activities of the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case will the hon. Member tell us how Parliament will keep control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As in other cases, it would keep control through the Secretary of State and also by considering the regular reports by the Board and by having reasonable opportunities to discuss those reports, which will have to be submitted to the Secretary of State by the Board. If the hon. Gentleman has read the Bill he must have seen that the Board will have to report regularly to the Secretary of State and that the accounts and records will also be open to inspection all the time by accredited people. There is no doubt about that that I am aware of. The hon. Gentleman need not worry. He will have his rights. There will be a certain amount of activity as always by Highlands and Islands Members and, no doubt, the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
State will come under fire where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will stick to the full-time formula. I do not believe in part-timers for such a job. This is a full-time job. It is a complicated and difficult task in a vast area. Nor do I think the entire Board should consist of technocrats. Technical assessors and experts, on its own staff and otherwise, will be available to it as to any other board. The Hydro-Electric Board has never been wholly a body of technical experts. It has experts and assessors fully available to it. Perhaps the suggestion of secondment of experts to the Board, put by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) could be additionally considered. But I hope that the Secretary of State will keep the membership full-time and at the number seven that he himself suggested, and not narrowly technical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that same time, I do not want Lord So and So driving in casually to attend passively at meetings of the Board four or five times a year. We can all think of such people who gladly do that sort of job but who have no taste for it or any belief in national enterprise except for being paid for it. We all know cases of people with strong anti-nationalisation prejudices who have been appointed to nationalised boards by right hon. Gentle-ment opposite to serve as part-timers. Indeed, the present Chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was bitterly against nationalisation, but now serves as full-time Chairman of the Board. But there it is. Hon. Members should not worry too much about the technical needs of the Board in the narrower sense among its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend will chose full-timers from among people above all dedicated to Highland development and capable of practical contribution to it. I do not think that such people would worry whether they were getting £10,000 or £15,000 or £5,000 a year. Of course, they should be adequately paid and have some reasonable security of tenure, subject to the usual conditions, so that they can plan ahead confidently for a few years as full-time members, but I do not think that salary is by any means the overriding thing. I could name some people—but it would be invidious to do so—who would be glad and honoured to give full-time service without extravagant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
salary in the interests of Highland development and the Highlands and Islands people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Early in his speech the Minister of State mentioned that the members of the Board would be full-time but later he talked about flexibility and the possibility of having, I think, as many as three part-time members. Could he clarify the position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would he also clarify his Amendment to Amendment No. 8 in the name of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston)? The Minister of State said that he preferred the Government's proposed form of words. Are we right in assuming that, in substance, there is no difference between the combination of his Amendment to Amendment No. 8 and Amendment No. 8 and what is written in the Clause? That is my own reading of it. My view is that, if we accept Amendment No. 8 and the Government's own Amendment to it, it will simply revert in substance to what the Clause already contains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment, Amendment No. 10, assumes that the chairman of the Board has been appointed by the Secretary of State and that every single member has been appointed by the Secretary of State, but it seeks to leave the appointment of the deputy chairman to the Board itself. I realise the existence of the precedents, but we were not actuated merely by precedent in making this suggestion. The hon. Gentleman himself pointed out the example of the Airports Authority, which follows the procedure we propose by this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the deputy chairman of the Airports Authority was not appointed by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where we departed from precedent is in the fact that the Minister appoints the Vice-Chairman after consultation with the Chairman of the Airports Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would go some way in the direction we propose in this Amendment. If this new Board is, as I imagine it to be, the latest model of a board or authority which will appear in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
the Government's legislation, I hope that we will look at the precedent of the Airports Authority rather than others in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there are cases where the deputy-chairman is not mentioned at all because, if he is not to be appointed by the responsible Minister, there is no need to mention him. Then, of course, it is left to the discretion of the board or authority itself to elect a deputy-chairman. I am not sure that quoting Statutes which lay down that deputy-chairmen should be appointed by the Minister responsible is necessarily a very good argument because, where such an appointment is not mentioned, it is left to the members of the boards concerned in the way we suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill as drafted, the Board would have very little say in its own affairs. Too much power is to be given to the Secretary of State. We feel that the Board could adequately perform the task of appointing its own deputy-chairman. After all, the Secretary of State himself will have appointed all the members of the Board, so that it is not likely that the choice would be unacceptable to him. I ask the Minister of State to consider the point again, because I do not think that it can be dismissed in the way he sought to do earlier today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bulk of the debate has centred around Amendment No. 7 in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). Of course, he is quite wrong when he claims that I dismissed it as not being serious. I said that if he was serious I would make the following reply—and I went on to make a reply. It was not a long one, but at least it dealt with the salient points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point was that he had not appreciated the purpose and the functions of the Board because, if he had, he would have realised that his proposal was hardly the best way to get people on to the Board who one would wish to have. I also spoke about regional government. I replied to the hon. Gentleman seriously. I am sorry if he did not understand it. I cannot give him understanding. I can only give him opinions, and if he does not accept them it is not my fault.

12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are to have a Board which we want to do a certain job and therefore there is something to be said for appointing the members. The argument against is that it is not democratic. But what is a democratic process? We have just had a General Election in which two parties put before the electors a policy of setting up a Highland Development Board. The Liberal Party set out its ideas in detail and the Labour Party said it intended to set up a small executive body and these were voted upon by the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people have given us a majority in the House of Commons, certainly of Scottish Members, and, although this may be a hackneyed phrase, they have given us a mandate to set up a board of this character. There is nothing undemocratic about this as the people have almost instructed us to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Board is to be financed by the taxpayer, and clearly there should be responsibility to the taxpayer for its operations. That responsibility can only find expression through the House and the individual personality of the Secretary of State. As I said in my first speech, the people have asked us to do this job and more or less returned us to to do it. In as much as the Secretary of State is responsible to the House of Commons he must, of necessity, have some right to appoint the members he wants to carry out the job. I can see nothing undemocratic about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the Highlanders not be satisfied with what is going on they can turn to the Consultative Council, which will, no doubt, be vocal in its opinions, but, more effectively, the Highlanders can go to their representatives in the House of Commons. This Board will produce a report which is debatable. We debate the Crofters Commission's report and can be highly critical of the Commission for the way it is carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the House. Within a limited area Questions can be tabled. As my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said, no one would suggest that we are going to hamper the Board by putting down a host of detailed Questions, but we have the right to examine the Board and criticise the Secretary of State in as much as he is responsible for the job which he is doing. That is democratic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
and in accord with what has previously happened in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is quite a good argument, but did the people give a mandate to the Labour Party to throw out the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That reference is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could reply to the hon. Gentleman but this is not the time and it would certainly not be in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a responsibility to the people in the Highlands through their elected representatives in the House. That is the constitutional position, and I would have thought that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West, who is a lawyer, would have been better informed about the position and have a much more mature view of democracy. We are far more democratic today than we have ever been. I suggest that the hon. Member reads the works of Lenin, who had a greater understanding of democracy in Britain than he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles was right in saying that this was not asked for by the people of the Highlands nor is it their desire that only Highlanders should be selected to the Board. I can assure the hon. Gentleman I have had consultations with almost every body in the Highlands, including representatives of all the local authorities, and none has asked for this. The people of the Highlands are willing to accept people if they can do the job. They want a small executive body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in mind a Board of something like five people, although I think we can attach too much importance to numbers, whereas quality is rather more important. We want a full-time Board if possible. We might have a Board of six, but this would depend on the number of part-time members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the precedents we have looked at, it has been the practice to give the Secretary of State this degree of flexibility and discretion as to the number of part-time and full-time members. This is done to give the Secretary of State or Minister a certain amount of elbow room, and we are doing nothing unusual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend not agree that in making comparisons, only boards with similar functions should be compared? This is a Board whose functions we have not yet discussed, and many of us may have ideas about them. It is going to have a uniqueness which has not been found in any board with which my hon. Friend is making a comparison. That is why I ask him to delay a final decision till we have finished with Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be looking at this all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given an indication of what our thoughts have been. It is not only a question of seeing what we put into Clause 3 but also seeing what is the experience of the Board and what they think is the most desirable number. During its operation the Board might find that five was a suitable number of full-time members. On the other hand it might become clear that there should be six or seven members. We have given a lot of thought to this and spent a long time considering preliminary figures and trying to visualise the manner in which the Board might function and whether people should have certain specialised knowledge. I have tried to indicate what our current thoughts are, but our minds are not closed to other possibilities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will realise how vitally important this is, because this Bill may set the pattern for other Bills and other boards in future, and it is extremely important that we get it right. Will my hon. Friend accept my assurance that everyone in the Highlands wants there to be at all times a reasonable number of full-time people on the job? My hon. Friend has not mentioned any number of full-time members. I mentioned the extreme case where we might have a board of three members and none of them full-time. That would be wholly unacceptable. If my hon. Friend decided on three full-time members that would be a basis, but he has given no voice to this so far. Let us get a definite figure as a minimum basis for full-time membership. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We recognise that as far as possible this should be a full-time body. I would be alarmed if there were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
not going to be at least four or five full-time members. Those are our thoughts. We recognise the importance of having full-time members of the Board as much as possible and that is what we are setting out to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about my own Amendment to the Amendment No. 8. The Amendment which we propose to amend and then to accept does not alter the substance of the subsection, but it makes it clearer. With that, I hope that the Committee will now come to a conclusion on the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has answered all my questions, and he did not deal with the position of the Airports Authority. He has been dealing with the question of part-time members, but the least he could do in accepting the Amendment is to say that he will at any rate consider whether the Board should be able to appoint its own deputy chairman. I understood him to say that if the Board consisted of seven members, up to three would be part time. Is that the answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing fixed about this. We would prefer to leave ourselves elbow room on this issue, but I have said that we recognise the importance of full-time membership and it is certainly not our intention to have a majority of part-time members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would mean in effect that there would be at least four full-time members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With a board of seven, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will that be written into the Bill? We should like it to be. That is most important of all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We prefer not to write it into the Bill but to leave it to the good sense of the Secretary of State and to the experts which we gather in the running of the Board. It is also dependent on the persons whom we are able to appoint. I have already said something about that. We have thought a good deal about the personnel of the Board, but we have not yet reached any fixed ideas. We could probably answer these questions much more clearly if we had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are difficult matters. There are the considerations of the value of a man

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
who could give half or three-quarters of his time and who, if he could give three-quarters of his time, might still be better than someone who could give full time. All these are factors, and we would like to retain some freedom, but I can assure my hon. Friends that we recognise the necessity for the Board to be full-time, the more full-time, the smaller. If we could get four out of five or five out of six members who were serving full time, that would be the ideal sort of arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we might not be able to do that. The Secretary of State might think it better to have four members of the Board full-time and one part-time, or four and two, dependent on the nature of the work to be done. We shall get a clearer idea as we have experience of the Board itself. The only modification of the Airports Authority Measure has been for the vice-chairman to be appointed after consultation with the chairman. It has nearly always been the practice for the Minister to consult a chairman when considering the appointment of a vice-chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chairman is absent at any time, the Board will have to appoint its own chairman for the time being, but he would not be statutorily recognised as the vice-chairman. This is the position with the Crofters Commission, for instance, of which there is a chairman but no vice-chairman. It is suggested that we should allow the Board to select its own vice-chairman, but the arguments which apply to the appointment of the chairman also apply to the appointment of the vice-chairman. I am quite open minded about this and it is not a political matter, but the fact is that a chairman has a dual responsibility. He is responsible not only to his committee, but to the Secretary of State. He is the Secretary of State's instrument and so it is the Secretary of State who should appoint him. It would hardly be right for the Secretary of State to be responsible for the activities of someone whom he did not appoint. The same arguments are true of a statutory vice-chairman, because it is conceivable that a chairman might be absent for substantial periods of time and the vice-chairman would then be in exactly the same position as the chairman, automatically assuming the position of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
chairman in absences which might extend over periods of months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these and not for reasons of prejudice or politics we would not like to accept the Amendment to provide for the vice-chairman to be appointed by the Board. As I have said, I am open-minded about this but I have not heard arguments which could lead me to suppose that my present view is wrong. However, I am quite prepared to think it over before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Crofters Commission has no statutory vice-chairman. I do not know whether it has happened, but it is possible for the chairman to be ill for two or three meetings, so that the Crofters Commission would have to elect a vice-chairman. In that case, the Secretary of State would be responsible for the conduct of the vice-chairman elected or appointed by the Commission. What is the difference between that and allowing the Board to do what we are asking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not have an official position as vice-chairman. The Crofters Commission, for instance, might choose Bill Smith on one occasion and somebody else on the next—any person it thought fit. However, it we appointed a statutory vice-chairman who would automatically assume the functions of the chairman and who would be vice-chairman for the whole duration of his term of office, the arguments which are true in the case of the chairman would also be true in the case of the vice-chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a small but important point. The Committee is agreed in broad principle that what we want is a Board consisting of at least five, as I would think, and possibly seven people, most of them full-time. Most of us realise that if the Board is to work, these people must be perhaps not supermen but people of real quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's view that there is inevitably a rather special relationship between the chairman of a board of this sort and the Secretary of State, that if there are different views, the chairman is the person who tells the Secretary of State that the Board is evenly balanced, for instance. However, when we are thinking in terms of a mostly full-time
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
executive committee of five or six people, then for the Secretary of State to appoint not only the chairman but the deputy-chairman is to some extent derogatory to the other members. The Secretary of State has his link in the chairman. It may well be that because of Highland weather conditions which, as we found at the weekend, are not always reliable, from time to time the Board will have to appoint its own vice-chairman 	<i>ad hoc.</i> If our Amendment were accepted, the Board would appoint a vice-chairman annually. Our suggestion would give the Board that extra feeling of its own position and dignity. If the hon. Gentleman cannot accept the Amendment, I hope that he will at least consider it before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to look again at this question of the appointment of the deputy-chairman, although without making commitments. It is not a matter of political principle or anything of that kind. It is a question of what is best for the Board, and I have an open mind about it. At least, it is a matter about which I have views, but I am prepared to see them change in the light of the arguments. I am prepared to look at it again before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has said that he has an open mind about the appointment of the deputy chairman. So have I, and so has my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). We are not thirled to any particular method of creating the deputy chairman and there are open minds about it in the Committee generally. Will my hon. Friend go at least that far in respect of full-time membership, which is vitally important, as some hon. Members have said? We require a decision on this at Ministerial level and at least some commitment by the Minister to think it out again with a view to accepting what we have said. Is it not absurd that not even the chairman is said in the Bill to be full-time? The Bill does not say that the chairman, the deputy chairman or even a minority of the membership of the Board must be full-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has told me what the Government attitude is, but the Labour Party will not necessarily be in power after the end of the next 20 year period.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
Anything might happen then, and we could have the wrong sort of Secretary of State playing ducks and drakes with the structure and powers of a board of this kind. We want the Board to work and work well. My hon. Friend has not committed himself to anything in this respect in the Bill. Is the chairman to be full-time, as it is vitally important that he should? Is the deputy chairman to be full time? The Bill says nothing on either of them. My hon. Friend has said that his intention is that a majority of the members should be full-time. That is of course, the very least he should say and the very least that the Highlands expect. They want a whole-time Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member for the Western Isles but are we also discussing Amendment No. 74 in page 1, line 26, after "a", insert "full-time", and Amendment to No. 65, in page 1, line 26, at end insert "full-time"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that when I called this group of Amendments I did not include Amendment No. 74 and Amendment No. 65, but as the debate has proceeded it has covered this matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not really in my hands, because it depends on what decision the Committee makes beforehand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister must be pressed on this point and we must incorporate in the Bill words to the effect that at least the chairman and deputy chairman are full-time members of the Board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed some discussion on this question of full-time and part-time members, but I was hoping—and that was why I did not call those two Amendments at this stage—that this would be a subject for a separate discussion. I would ask the Committee not to discuss this issue further because if hon. Members do I will have to bring in a discussion on Amendment Nos. 74 and 65 at this stage, which would mean, in effect, that when we come to the Schedule hon. Members would not be allowed to discuss or vote on the matter. I hope, therefore, that the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will leave this subject until we come to the Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to leave the argument there meantime, for we need not argue it further now. I am content to rest on the remarks of the Minister, when he indicated that his intentions regarding the need for a full time majority were as expressed already, without my now repeating them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision is one for the Chair. This has been done on many previous occasions.

	<div class='title'>Clause 2.—(DIRECTIONS AND ADVICE TO THE BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 5, to leave out subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that some of my hon. Friends —whose names appear above the Amendment—were not aware of the Ruling which you have just given, Mr. Steele, otherwise they would have been ready to proceed with this Amendment. I understand that they expected the Committee to have a discussion on the Question, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment raises a matter which, in our opinion, is of very great importance, because the subsection would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
give the Secretary of State the power of directing the Board in a way which we think is unnecessary. During Second Reading we made it clear that we consider in general that too much power is to be given by the Bill to the Secretary of State, and that, within the powers written into the Bill, too little discretion will be given to the Board. In subsection (1) we find that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may give to the Board directions of a general character as to the exercise and performance of their functions, and the Board shall give effect to any such directions."</p></blockquote>
We would prefer to see that subsection deleted. We would also like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about the kind of directions he visualises would be given under this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there must be provisions under which the Board would keep in close touch with the Secretary of State and provisions for consultation. In as much as the Board has been appointed by the Secretary of State, there must be a relationship between the Board and the Government. However, the statement that the Secretary of State may give direction of this completely general character, and that the Board must simply do what the Secretary of State says, could mean that the Board would be entirely the puppet of the Government and have no latitude to carry on jobs in the Highlands of a day to day nature—to start and assist in the pump priming, which is perhaps one of its most vital tasks, without the whole time being directed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading we made it clear that we thought that within certain financial limits the Board should be given discretion to do things on its own. The sentiment which we see written into the subsection, of sweeping directions being given to the Board by the Secretary of State, is one which we would prefer to see out of the Bill altogether. We would, before taking further action on the matter, like an explanation of what is contemplated by the wording of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The omission of subsection (1) would seriously weaken the effectiveness of the application of any Government policy in regard to Highland development. There has been a lot of criticism about the powers given to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
Secretary of State in the Bill, but whether or not the Amendment is intended to abolish some of those powers I do not know. Perhaps its main purpose is that, but it should be remembered that this would be probably the only public body or nationalised industry for which, if the Amendment were accepted, the Minister would not have power to give directions of a general character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directions which he might give could be of a negative or positive character. They might be restrictive or widening in their nature, but in any case the Secretary of State does have power since he must approve the schemes. This is a power which, as we see it, might be of a positive—indeed, we expect it to be such—fashion to ensure that the Board adopts a constructive policy in certain matters. It might be Government policy at a particular time to attempt to advance certain developments, such as forestry, in which case general directions could be given to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be remembered that this is not an unusual power. It is designed to enable the Secretary of State to influence, to use that word, the policy of the Board in a helpful manner and in accordance with the policy of the Government. As I said, this is not an unusual power. It exists in most other Statutes dealing with statutory authorities and public boards, and we would wish to retain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the Minister. This is not a subsection which gives unusual powers to the Secretary of State. Incidentally, I am somewhat concerned to find hon. Members of the Opposition Front Bench moving an Amendment of this kind. It would seem that, if it were accepted, subsection (1) would be removed without anything being put in its place. The Amendment does not suggest anything which should replace it. This puzzles me. Perhaps, had any of the hon. Members concerned—the hon. Members whose names appear on the Paper above the Amendment—been here to move the Amendment we would have obtained their views of what it is all about. The disappearance from the Committee of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) distresses me because I am sure that many hon. Members would have liked to have commented on the remarks he would have made had he been here.
