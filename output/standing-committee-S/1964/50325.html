	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [23rd March],</i> in page 1, line 15, to leave out from second "be" to "areas" in line 17 and insert "such".—	<i>[Mr. Hendry.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday I had almost finished the remarks I intended to make. I was discussing how, in the areas of the Western Highlands, we face social problems of the same kind as exist in the intermediate Highland areas. One of the biggest of those problems is the drift of population. There are also problems of communication. These are linked with the progress made on the farms and the consequent less opportunity for the employment of our people. As the people move away, we get, in the areas outwith the Highlands as well as in the Highlands, problems of community life and social life and it becomes very much more difficult to keep young people in those areas. It is not only a question of jobs but also of social life even if the jobs are available. There is thus an even greater tendency for young people to leave those areas. There is the problem of the ageing community in the Highlands, and elsewhere in some of the glens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the Amendment and the possibility of the extension of the powers of the Board over a wider area I have not tried to argue that extension of the area is necessarily good. It has to be viewed in relation to the powers of the Board. I would not like to see extension of the area as the Bill stands at the moment, but if there were a hope of extending the powers of the Board and making them more reasonable and more
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
democratic there would be a stronger case for extending the work of the Board. In areas outwith the Highlands there are similar problems as within the Highlands. Giving the right powers to the Board could help a great deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has said that even where there are opportunities for work the young people are leaving the land. Can he give us specific examples?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can speak for the glens of which I have knowledge, and where there is not a sufficient good social life for the young people, who are inclined to leave, so the tendency is that the older people stay and not the younger. I shall be surprised if the hon. Member can cite evidence to the contrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that even where there is a smaller population it is surprising how good the educational facilities are and how strong the community sense can be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that where there is a good community life it can be very much better than is found in cities. The point I was trying to make is that if it is eroded we get into a vicious circle, with the young people leaving. But I do agree that there are remarkable exceptions to the general rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We ought to regard it as a tribute that hon. Gentlemen opposite are anxious to extend the area over which the Board will function. It was suggested that the area should be extended, on the basis that there are similar problems in similar areas, but the Bill is not intended to deal with similar problems throughout the United Kingdom. In that case we should have had a kind of Local Employment Bill, picking out spots all over the country with ageing populations, and matters of that kind. I would draw attention to the long title of the Bill which says that its intention is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make further provision for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and for purposes connected therewith."</p></blockquote>
If we accepted the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), and his Amendment,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
we could bring within the scope of the Board the Borders and places like Roxburgh and Selkirk. We might even bring in Galloway, or any other area in Scotland. That is not the intention of the Bill, whatever the problems of the Border might be. No doubt the Tories will now give a considerable amount of thought to them. The Bill is to deal with the Highlands and Islands. Most of the arguments of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West, were beside the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion centres around how we are to define the Highlands and Islands. That brings us to the other two Amendments. The second Amendment, in the name of the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean), proposes to include Bute, but that is an old argument in the Scottish Standing Committee. In fact, the hon. Gentleman raised this question on the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Bill, in December, 1959. This is what was said to him in reply:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There must also be some sympathy for my hon. Friend's contention that parts of his constituency should be included in the Bill. It would, however, be very difficult to accept this proposal. I know that there are some general criticisms of the fact that by tradition the Highlands are taken to be the seven crofting counties, but this tradition has sound reasons behind it in the peculiar complex of problems these counties show. It would be impossible to accept this proposal without admitting many other areas which could claim to be comparable, in one way or another, to parts of the crofting counties."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 15th December. 1959; col. 66.]</p></blockquote>
That was a Conservative Minister's reply to the hon. Gentleman. It is our reply too, for the reason that we are dealing with an area which, for reasons of geography and history, has thrown up a society with its own traditions—I was going to say "peculiarities"—and its own method of farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to crofting, the area has become generally recognised for 40 or 50 years as the seven Highland counties. It was so recognised in the Congested Districts Act, 1897, in the Highlands and Islands Medical Services Act, as one to which special remedies could be applied, in the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act and in the two Crofters Acts. All this was for the very good reason that the area is generally known and recognised and has easily definable boundaries
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
which cover the areas which we generally mean by "Highlands and Islands".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the problems of Arran might be similar to those of the seven crofting counties, and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Board, or, for that matter the Scottish Economic Planning Council or the Secretary of State, from deciding that the best way of dealing with those problems is by an order and by including the area within the provisions of the Bill. Such provision is already made in the Clause where it says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other areas in Scotland as, having regard to their character and proximity to the said counties, the Secretary of State may, by order made by statutory instrument, from time to time designate."</p></blockquote>
There is nothing to prevent that from being done if the Board, the Scottish Economic Planning Council or the Secretary of State can be persuaded that this is the way to deal with the problems of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that we should set up the Board to deal with the area which has been generally recognised in legislation in the past as the Highlands and Islands, and that we should give the Board a chance to find its feet and to get going. Then, in the light of its progress and experience, we can begin to see whether it would be desirable to include other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greater part of the argument of the hon. Gentleman was ill-founded and did not have a great deal to do with this point. He tried to show the benefits which the seven crofting counties would enjoy as compared with Arran, but acceptance of the Amendment would not change that situation. All it would do would be to include Bute in the Highland area for the purposes of the Bill, but not for the purposes of the Crofters Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did try to emphasise the point. What I was urging was that the inclusion of Bute could be regarded as a justification for extending to it the benefits of previous legislation, and also as a precedent for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not blaming the hon. Gentleman for that argument but it is hardly relevant to his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be the thin end of the wedge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be true but it does not have a great deal to do with the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third Amendment specifies areas which, by their character and proximity, it is suggested should be included within the provisions of the Bill. The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) mentions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Counties of Nairn, Moray, Banff, Aberdeen, Angus, Perth and Bute".</p></blockquote>
I am not certain that anything would be achieved by the Amendment. It omits the Highland part of Kincardine and of your own constituency, Mr. Steele, Dunbartonshire, West. It omits part of Stirling, which should be included within the area. There is not a great deal gained by the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason why we think that the Amendment ought not to be accepted is that by specifying certain counties by name in the Bill we run the danger of raising false hopes that those parts of the counties will be included in the Bill. We ought not to do that. The Bill is sufficiently flexible to include any of the areas which have the same character and proximity as the areas already covered by the Bill. This can be done. Provision is made for this without introducing amending legislation. It can be done by way of Statutory Instrument, which is a much simpler method of doing it than by having to wait for further legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It gives the Government a certain flexibility in approaching this problem. It gives the Board and the Secretary of State the opportunity to see how the operations of the Board are progressing, whether changes should be made and it gives the opportunity for areas to be included on their merits or in accordance with what is felt by the Secretary of State as to the desirability of including them in order to tackle their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in subsection (2) as good a set of words which one could wish to have. I understand the feelings of persons in areas neighbouring the seven Highland counties. To be honest, we had a considerable discussion about what line we should draw, and at one time we wondered whether we should not draw the old Highland line, which would have included a number of these areas. However, we felt that because this had become
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
a definitely recognised area—recognised in Acts extending back 60 to 70 years—and since they were areas which had become accepted and known by everyone, it would be better to keep to that tradition, while at the same time providing for the opportunity of adding to the area if circumstances made it desirable to do so. For these reasons I am afraid that we must reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel that the Minister has entirely resolved in his remarks some of the doubts and uncertainties which several of my hon. Friends have had about the Amendments and the Clause to which they refer. As the Minister pointed out, the Secretary of State is taking power to designate by Statutory Instrument areas outside the traditional crofting counties. He also told us that in the course of their considerations the possibility of including all the areas north of the Highland line had been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who represent constituencies which might or might not be included at some future date have, as I see it, difficulty in deciding at this stage our attitude to the rather double-handed compliments, the facilities offered under the Bill. We are still left in some doubt as to how we might be treated at some future time. As my non. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) pointed out, we have in the east coast counties a number of communities in the glens and the small fishing communities along the coast which have a close resemblance to the fishing communities to be found in the crofting counties themselves. The glen communities suffer very much from the same problems which afflict many areas of the Highlands—comparative remoteness, difficult communications, and so on—and for these reasons we would obviously in principle be attracted by the possibility that at some future date the Secretary of State should choose to designate us as coming within the scope of the Board by Statutory Instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty to which several of my hon. Friends have referred in discussing these Amendments is that we still do not know what changes will be introduced in the Bill when we come to discuss the powers which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
pointed out on Second Reading, have been largely allocated to the Secretary of State and not to the Board. If we can amend the Bill along the lines he suggested on Second Reading, then I am sure that we in Angus and other counties along the east coast would be happy to see these benefits extended to us by Statutory Instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, among other, I believe, very hopeful developments in this area, great possibilities for the development of tourism, particularly in the glens in Angus. We have all the attraction of the beautiful surroundings and the scenery which is to be found in the crafting counties. We also enjoy much closer proximity to centres of population, in Dundee and the central belt. In recent years we have seen a substantial increase in the tourist trade, encouraged by such extremely worthwhile developments as pony trekking in the glens. These developments offer prospects of bringing to the glens money and employment which are extremely welcome. Hon. Gentlemen opposite tend to believe that the landowners are entirely opposed to, and take an entirely negative attitude towards, the development of tourism, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a discussion of tourism on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Steele. I was merely trying to suggest that whether or not we wish to see our areas included within the scope of these Amendments depends to a considerable extent on the effect which the powers which we shall discuss at a later stage might have on the development of tourism and other industries in our Highland areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has already made a passing reference to that, but we really cannot discuss that at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I should like to emphasise is that at this stage we can only take a reserved attitude till we see what will happen later in our discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to get clear in my mind exactly what it was the hon. Gentleman said earlier, since his
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
remarks rather puzzled me. It was not clear to me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not clear to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —what he meant when he said that the fishing villages along the east coast have a closer resemblance to the Highlands than the crofting counties themselves. Would he explain what he meant more clearly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not so sure that we want a long explanation at this stage. We must confine ourselves to the Amendment, and I hope that the hon. Member will not accept that invitation at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not, Mr. Steele, except to say that it was not my intention to suggest that these communities were more like the crofting areas than the crofting areas themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other argument which has not, perhaps, been brought out as much as it should and I would like some enlightenment from the Minister on it. It seems to me, from reading the Bill, that there is the possibility that, if our areas are excluded from the scope of the Board, then at some future date, if there is a decision to invest Government money in a major industrial project in the north of Scotland, there may be a tendency to place it inside the area coming within the scope of the Board, whether or not this is the most desirable situation from the economic point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking, for example, of the suggestion that we might at a subsequent date have a second pulp mill in the north of Scotland. It has been suggested that such a project might be placed on the eastern side. If this were so, is the Minister able to offer any assurance that the siting of such a project would not be restricted to the area within the scope of the Board, and that the selection of the site—regardless of Government money being invested in the project—would be dictated purely by economic considerations and the availability of raw materials and labour? If a second pulp mill were situated outside the area to which the Board's authority will apply that would not necessarily mean that such a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
project would not benefit the area inside it, because, as we have seen, the benefits from such a major industrial project can stretch well beyond the immediate vicinity of its site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, what we on the east coast feel is that we would very much like to have our communities, which are in many ways similar to those in the glens and also in the small fishing villages, included within the scope of this arrangement, provided only that we can ensure that the powers are allocated to the Board and applied in the way suggested by my right hon. Friend and that they are not simply brought under the jurisdiction of a "big brother" Secretary of State with a very large stick and an empty pocket. For that reason, till we know about this matter, I do not think that we can give a definitive answer to how we would like to be treated under these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a certain quiet humour when my hon. Friend the Minister of State hurled a reply of the previous Government at the heads of hon. Gentlemen opposite. Since they have been floored by their own bricks, I hope that they will not needlessly prolong a debate which has been adequately answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with the Minister's reply. The traditional aspect is one which we have always accepted in this Committee, but that does not mean that we necessarily can go on always accepting it; and I was glad that my hon. Friend took that point of view. I have never completely accepted it, because I have always contended that when considering Bills dealing with Highland affairs we should realise that the Highlands are, in other respects of the word, a crofting part of Scotland and should come within the area of the seven crofting counties. So from the point of view of the traditional aspect of the matter, I thought that my hon. Friend was on sound ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Measure differs in this respect from other Highland legislation affecting Highland affairs which we have considered. The position of the areas outside the crofting counties is safeguarded because it lies within the power of the Secretary of State or the Board to decide that any area can be designated a part of
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
the crofting area and so come under the Bill. That seems fair enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I read this Amendment I wondered why the southern part of Lanarkshire was left out because it is a hilly part of the country which reaches as near heaven as do many parts of the Highlands. Why in this moment of joy should the uplands of the Lowlands be excluded from the Bill? No one has suggested they should be included, yet one of the highest points in Scotland is neglected there. There may be a suggestion in a later Amendment that the uplands of the Lowlands should come in to mark this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one starts considering what parts of Scotland are to be excluded one has to have a definition. I have always contended that one part which should be included in the Highlands is Arran, which is similar in characteristics with the Highlands and in the way it deals with the land, and it has suffered as badly under landlordism as any part of the Highlands. Its economic position is due to landlordism. There is a case for Arran, as my hon. Friend has said, but the position is safeguarded and the Minister gave a satisfactory answer. I hope we shall not, in those circumstances, spend too much time debating what should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to intervene in this debate again but the Minister rather misunderstood the purpose of these Amendments. No one has greater respect for him as a private person than I have, but I must answer what he has said. I used to listen with rapt attention to his speeches when he was in Opposition. They had a refreshing and original point of view. Even in Government he shows considerable inventiveness and initiative in his letters to back benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope and trust that the hon. Member will keep himself to the subject of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to do that, Mr. Steele. All I was saying was that the hon. Gentleman shows great initiative, because no other Minister has addressed me before in an official letter in verse. However when the hon. Gentleman sits there in the Minister of State's seat he seems to be overcome with his sense of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
responsibility and I was extremely sorry that he stuck so closely to the Scottish Office brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman is abhorrent of any change at all, and all his arguments were for sticking to the definition in the Bill. He told us that the definition of the crofting counties went back sixty or seventy years and he referred to several Acts which we knew. I had hoped, after all the Government's talk about their dynamism and so on that we would have had something better than that—a whole rethinking of what constitutes the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said he had never seen such a rush of people trying to get under the crofters' umbrella. That is not what we are trying to do. We are trying to get some definition of the Highlands which makes sense. As the hon. Member for the Western Isles knows the crofters are principally confined to the western part of the Highlands as currently defined. I am sure the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) will tell me if I am wrong but I think there is little community between the people of Dadenoch and the people of Skye which is also within the definition. Their mode of life and culture is quite different. This Celtic culture is not common to the whole area. There are certain things in common between all parts of the defined area and certain contiguous parts outside. That I have tried to point out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister, in my Amendment, to think again on this question of definition and to leave out the narrow definition, reserving unto himself power to make a new definition by statutory order. I men-
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
tion Dadenoch in the constituency of the hon. Member for Inverness and compare it with Deeside in my constituency. I am prepared to prove to the Minister that there is a complete community of interests between Dadenoch and upper Deeside and Strath Don. It would give me great pleasure to invite the Minister to come to my constituency and see for himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not spoiling his case by overstating it? Subsection (2) makes it quite clear, where it mentions "their character and proximity". How much wider does he want it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing my point. The Bill does give the Minister power to include these areas but puts the wrong emphasis on the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proposing to the Minister that he should think again about this. He requires time to do that, and he may want to visit the area to see what should be included in this definition. He should get away from this definition of the Highlands as consisting of the seven crofting counties. I would have great pleasure in inviting him to come to my constituency and accept my hospitality, and I will show him cultivated land 1,600 ft. above sea level. He will not find that in Inverness. If he brings strong boots I will also take him to the top of the second highest peak—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already indicated that on this Clause I do not want a discussion on tourism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am comparing these areas and showing that some of them are as high land as any other part of Scotland. I will show the Minister the highest mountain pass traversed by road in Scotland. I can show him croft after croft in the sense of viable farms outside the definition of the Highlands and point out as many villages as he will find anywhere in Scotland. All this shows that the definition is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to think about this definition and get away from the old one which goes back to about 1880 and use some initiative and imagination and give us a proper definition. I am not seeking to bring other parts of Scotland under the crofters' umbrella. No doubt, many crofters would hate to come under the Marxist dictatorship which this Bill is envisaging for us. I am confining

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief. The object of my Amendment is rather different from that of the others. My object was to restrict the area of expansion. That was the idea. The Minister was, I thought, very reasonable in his reply, and in view of this I would not press the Amendment. Remarks have been made about Kincardine and Dunbarton. I was asked why I have not included Kincardine. The whole object was to restrict to contiguous areas the area to which the Board would expand. That is why I excluded Dunbarton although, as the Minister said, for very good reasons I might have included the Borders. However, there are other reasons why not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was not one that he thought there were not in Kincardine very good prospects for the hon. Gentleman's political party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are, naturally, similarities between areas all over Scotland but we have an urgent problem to tackle in the Highland area and if we have to wait till we have a total reorganisation of local government areas, for example, we shall have to wait too long. I thought that the Minister's answer was very reasonable, although he was somewhat unfair to me in that my object was not to extend but to restrict the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether it would be in order, Mr. Steele, to ask whether in view of the dolorous expressions of hon. Members on this side of the Committee, you could remind hon. Members that this is happy smiles day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I was a little disappointed with the Minister's reply, particularly by the arguments on which he based it, and which all lay in the past, going back nearly a hundred years and based for the most part on
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
what had been said, without, so far as I remember, any signs of approval by the Labour Party, when my right hon. Friend was Secretary of State. The Labour Party claims to be a progressive and revolutionary party when it suits it. Here was an opportunity when it might have shown that by accepting my revolutionary little Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I was encouraged to hear the Minister say that there was nothing to prevent what I had suggested from being done. I am not particular how it is done, as long as it is done. Under the Bill, his right hon. Friend is to have great powers, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will urge his right hon. Friend to use them and to use his influence with the Board, which appears to be considerable, to make it one of the Board's first tasks to consider the problem of including the County of Bute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to comply with all the conditions laid down in the Bill both as to character and proximity. It also consists entirely of islands and is, I think, the only county in the whole of the United Kingdom to do so. Now that the Bill refers to Highlands and Islands, it comes within that category and, as the Secretary of State himself said on Second Reading, these islands to a greater or lesser extent share many of the problems of the crofting counties. I do not care how what I want done is done as long as it is done, and I hope that the Government will give it urgent consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to take part in this debate because the question of a definition of the Highlands has concerned me for a long time. I remember referring to it in my maiden speech when I was followed, very courteously, by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) who, I know, had and has much sympathy in what he said then and what he has said now about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I am in some difficulty, because without a firm assurance about the future passage of the Bill I would not wish my constituency to be brought within the definition of the Highlands for the purposes of the Bill as it now stands. Clauses 6 and 11, which we shall be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I will refer to Clauses 6 and 11 no more now, although we shall have much to say about them when the time comes. I hope that it will be in order to make the simple point that if we consider Clause 1 in isolation we can consider the question of a definition of the Highlands, but that, equally, at a later stage it will be open to hon. Members to reconsider how their constituencies are affected by the definition in the light of what transpires. I should like to make it clear at the outset—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must bear in mind that we must stick to the Amendments which we are now discussing. If the hon. Member changes his mind, there is the Report stage when this matter can be raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the point has been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) made a very powerful speech and referred to the fact that the standard Scottish Office definition of the Highlands, that is, the definition which confines the Highlands to the seven crofting counties, goes back to the eighteen-eighties and is largely irrelevant today, except where crofting matters are concerned. Even then, there may be some dispute, because there are many crofts outside the crofting counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed by the Minister's earlier remarks. I apologise for having missed the first few minutes of his speech, but I understood from the latter part of what he said that he had advanced the old argument of administrative convenience. Of course, it is administratively convenient for the Highlands to consist simply of the seven crofting counties, so that a line can be drawn to enclose the area, but I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman, of all people, should advance an argument of that kind. I do not go quite as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West in saluting the imagination and initiative and versifying qualities and so on of the hon. Gentleman, because frankly—and I do not say this offensively—I have found him on that side of the Committee since he took office to be rather dull and heavyhanded in his inactivity. My memory of him when he was in Opposition was of a very rigorous character,
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
and I hope that that character remains. I remember well how he used to cry out against such things as administrative convenience day after day, calling for common sense and reality and other fine qualities to be observed by the Government. What a change there is today in the hon. Gentleman!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Are we debating the characteristics of my hon. Friend, or dealing with the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was simply a passing reference. I am not sure whether 	<i>The Scotsman</i> in time will be more disappointed with the hon. Gentleman himself, or with the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State. This is a matter which will be of interest later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county boundary definition could simply be extended. I would not go as far as is suggested by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). For example, I do not think that the whole of the County of Perth could claim to be a Highland county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will read my arguments in the context of the Bill he will see that I was merely referring to parts of the counties which are mentioned in my Amendment, so that it would be part of Perthshire and not necessarily all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that and I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for underlining that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are areas of Perthshire which it would be relatively simple to determine as Highland in character, and others as non-Highland in character. I imagine that that was the sort of consideration which led the previous Administration to define the boundary of the Highland area for the purposes of the Highland Study, there is a map showing the area of that Study in the White Paper Which was published last September. The Highland definition for the purposes of the Study follows a line much more in keeping with the geographical definition of the Highlands and also in keeping with the boundary which common sense would dictate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main difference is one of geography, but there are others. There are the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
cultural differences between the Highlands and other parts of Scotland. In his very entertaining speech on Tuesday my right hon. Friend spoke of the possible need for the development of a new sort of culture in the Highlands, something he alluded to lightly as half way between the Beatles and the bagpipes. However this may be, until very recent times the Highlands have certainly had a distinct culture of their own. There is a reason for this, quite apart from going into the sort of dream world of the shennachie, which is far from the true condition of things, but the Highland people are a different people. They are a people of a different race and, until, recently, they had a different tongue. Boswell used to refer to the Highlanders as people speaking the Irish tongue and one finds that reference to Gaelic as recently as the mid-nineteenth century in writings and letters of the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we are sufficiently concerned with Scotland without bringing Ireland into the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making is the difference of the Highlanders who only 110 or 120 years ago were popularly regarded as speaking in what was referred to as the Irish tongue, thus underlining the fact that they are different people, because the tongue was the Irish tongue. They had a different race, a different tongue, and a different social system. They had a different dress, as the hon. Member for Inverness well knows. Had the hon. Member for Inverness worn the kilt 170 years ago, in the time of the Dress Act, he would probably have been deported to Australia. Far from wearing it in the Royal Palace of Westminster, if he had worn the kilt in Edinburgh, then, according to Macaulay, he would probably have been strung up from a tree, not because he was the hon. Member for Inverness—one could dispute whether that is or is not worthy of punishment—but because wearing the kilt was regarded at that time as the mark of this different race, this different people; a fine people, but different in all regards from those to be found elsewhere in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But above all, it is geography which makes the difference. It is geography which has allowed the old culture and the old ways to survive in the Highlands
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
until relatively modern times. It is geography which is at the root of the problem which the Highlands face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is landlordism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is geography which has led to the depopulation of the Highlands and to its problems, the problems of living in remote areas, particularly the problems of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have hoped that the Minister would have taken a wider view of these difficulties. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West has spoken of the high land in his own constituency, not as an advertisement for the touristic attractions of his constituency, but to point to the fact that in West Aberdeenshire, as in other parts of Scotland outside the crofting counties, we have some of the highest land and some of the remotest places which share with the Highlands the problems which have given rise to the need for further development of the Highlands. One example is the Lairig Gru, which starts in the Highlands and ends outside the Highlands. Glenshee in my own constituency is remote and I would like to see Glenshee brought within the coverage of a more respectable version of the Bill and benefit from whatever assistance is given to tourism, because tourism in Glenshee is an important part of the development of the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we have the problem of various roads. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West referred to the possibility of a road in his constituency, starting outside the Highlands and running into the Highlands. There is a similar problem a little to the west of my own home where a proposal is now being considered by the county council and other authorities to build a road from Loch Rannoch across Rannoch Moor to Glencoe. It would seem quite wrong when a large part of this road is an essential part of the development of the Highland transport system that it should fall within the responsibilities of authorities outside the Highlands. This is a matter which we can debate more widely on Clause 3, but in this instance we have a non-Highland authority concerned with problems which are essentially a Highland problem. The road from Rannoch runs all through typically Highland country
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
and emerges in Argyll, which even the Minister would recognise as a Highland county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for a much more elastic approach. I recognise that subsection (2) gives the Secretary of State power to designate other areas of Scotland as coming within the application of the Bill, but the problem is wider than that. It is one of general principle, and I submit that in the name of common sense if for no other reason we should declare that the high lands are the true Highlands, regardless of county boundaries, and at last break away from the old crofting county definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not be influenced by the speech of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, Mr. Steele. My only point is that the hon. Member in his speech today ran completely contrary to what he said in the opening sentence of his own Second Reading speech. He will see that that is the case, if he reads tomorrow the report of today's speech, which I hope that he has not already forgotten also. I am afraid he has done all his homework in the last five minutes. He gave us a nice flowery peroration; but if he charges hon. Members on this side of the Committee with sentimentality he must not base his speech largely upon the very same thing by talking nostalgically of the old times, the old tartans, the old language, right up to the last echoes of the Highland clearances. He cannot have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, he cannot convincingly ask to be brought under the Highlands and Islands umbrella as he did originally in the House and again today in Committee when, in the meantime—as he has forgotten—in the Second Reading debate he stoutly denied that he wanted to come under the Bill's umbrella after all. When he saw the Bill he said that he wanted to go out into the rain again—into the economic storm conditions which the Tories had left in the Highlands after their long years in office. He wants one sort of treatment for Perthshire one day, and another, the next. Today he is back for the moment where he started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These, however, are all minor debating points. His Question of three weeks ago was obviously put down to have a slap at the Bill, but today his speech has been full of the emotionalism and sentimentality which he deplores in others, in favour of extending the Bill. There has been today a wistful pibroch running through his speech, and synthetic tartans flashed before our eyes to move and dazzle us. Anyway, the main thing is that he is now back under the umbrella of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will not go back into his dubious history again at this stage. We are looking forward these days; and the Tories must just accept that fact. The hon. Member tried to justify his argument on the basis of two things. If, as some Tory hon. Members have argued, some fishing villages in Banffshire happen to look similar to some fishing villages in Shetland or the Hebrides, that has nothing to do with this Bill, because there are villages in the Western Isles which look very like villages in Brittany or Cornwall. That would not bring Cornwall under the Bill. All this argument is impractical and nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member went so far at one stage as to embrace Ireland and its old language in his case for more territory in the definition of the Highlands and Islands. Presumably, since in the Schedule land is defined as including water, in view of all that we have talked about in respect of contiguity and proximity, if that argument were extended to its logical conclusion Northern Ireland would be brought in as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) who moved the Amendment told us that he did not want to bring all these areas he pleaded for under the crofting umbrella. The Tory Party should clear the minds of their ex-supporters in the Highlands, for whom they still presume to speak. Do they or do they not wish to come under the crofting umbrella?

	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
matters is the question how practical it is to extend the definition for the purpose of the Bill and its operation. I can only say that I have had experience, as other Members have, of trying to cover the Highland area as a Member of a body dealing with Highland problems and development in general, as covered under this Clause. The body on which I sat as Chairman was given a remit which, in the first place, was like that which is to be given to the Board under the Clause—to keep under review all the social and economic problems of the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were acting in an advisory capacity. We had representatives of all the Highlands and Islands county councils, and we had some very able and knowledgeable people. We also had appointees of the Secretary of State, and representatives of the Highland large burgh and other people. They were nearly all Highlanders, with some added members. Most of them knew the area and the people intimately, and many of us had grown up among the problems of the area. They found that all their time was taken up, even in an advisory capacity, in covering the area even territorially. In fact, it was never properly covered in the 7 years during which I was Chairman. We never really did justice by actual visiting to all the areas, although we did our best. An extension of that vast area would be damaging to the purposes which we are seeking to achieve under the Bill and Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise the point of view of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) is different from the Tory one. He wants a definition to limit the extent to which this territorial area in the Bill can be expanded, from the point of view of future operations of the Board. I agree with him. If a body of this kind can cover the Highlands and Islands as now defined—territorially they are doing pretty well. Acting as the Highland Panel has been doing all these years, in only an advisory capacity, it has been difficult enough to carry on this work. Goodness knows what an impossible labour would be placed upon a Development Board which had many wide executive powers and development duties. It would have a far more difficult time than an advisory body.

would make the work of the Board impossible to plan and conduct, let alone to fulfil. I hope that my hon. Friend will be fortified by my few words. Every member of the Highland Panel will, I know, agree that the territory is big enough in every way as it is, even for a body acting only in an advisory capacity. I hope that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) will accept that what I have said is not due to any ill will towards other areas.

Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) because I think I can make it clear that I am not trying to put forward the case which he has been busy trying to shoot down. The Amendment seeks to delete from the Clause the delineation of the crofting counties as they now stand. In deciding to move the Amendment no doubt the hon. Member was encouraged by the fact that the Clause provides for an extension of the area by statutory instrument, after the Bill becomes an Act. From the remarks of the Minister of State it is clear that he confirms that that was the intention once the Bill had come into existence, depending upon circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that this seems to be a good opportunity to consider whether the Highland area should be redefined, since we are now considering a Bill which deals with development. At present the Bill defines the area as that which includes the crofting counties. It is important to recognise that although the county boundaries and the line which they provide in respect of the crofting counties have been useful in defining an area for the purposes of the Crofting Commission, the same area is not satisfactory for the purposes of the development of the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crofting is concentrated along the west coast. The county boundaries or the counties themselves form a useful administrative division, but they cannot be regarded as enclosing the Highland area when we are thinking in terms of development, and in terms of what is happening now and what can be done in
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
the future. My hon. Friends have given some examples. I would merely say that the Highland area at the moment ends at the head of the Drumochter Pass. If a person goes a few yards to one side he is not in the Highlands, but if he goes to the Inverness side he is. There may be a good administrative reason for this from the point of view of the Crofting Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the line runs arbitrarily through the Grampians. It may be said that there are not many crofts on the high slopes of the Grampians, and not many people are resident there, but for the purposes of development the whole area is of interest to the new Board, because it will wish to take an interest in what is being done there for recreation, for the development of facilities for tourism, in the way of winter sports, and for the preservation of flora and fauna. It would be odd, to say the least, if the new Board concerned itself only with what was happening on one side of the Grampians—up to a quite arbitrary line—and not with the other side, in respect of which there might well be schemes involving difficulties of the very same sort. This is the point with which my hon. Friends and I are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) put down an Amendment which included a number of other counties. He has explained since that he did not mean to include the whole of each of those counties. His point was simply that the Amendment would have enabled portions of those counties to be brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that whole counties from my own constituency should be brought in. I merely suggest that this is a good opportunity of redefining the Highland line for the purposes of development, so that it is not tied to the concept of crofting. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us whether there is some insuperable administrative reason against getting away from the county boundaries. I appreciate that if, from the administrative point of view, it is possible to add only whole counties, difficulties may arise, because some of these counties are Highland only to a small extent. I should be grateful if the Minister can explain this point, because if there is no insuperable difficulty I hope that during the course of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
the Bill through the House we shall be able to find a way of getting away from the crofting area definition and redefine the Highlands for the purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) said in his excellent speech, which I believe was a maiden speech in this Committee, and on which I congratulate him, he and I are not suggesting at this stage that the whole of this large area should be included in that covered by this Clause. Indeed, we do not like other portions of the Bill, but if we can improve the Bill, so that it comes out of Parliament as a useful Measure with a Board which can do a useful job of development in the Highlands, we hope that the best possible area for its work can be defined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) has a particular problem. He put forward his Amendment because off the coast of Bute there are the only substantial islands in the West of Scotland which are not covered already in the proposed area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister to tell us about the difficulties, administrative or otherwise, of getting away from county boundary lines. I entirely understand the administrative reasons for starting with the crofting counties, because these are the convenient and easy way of starting off, but I appeal to him to reconsider the position to see whether we can take this opportunity of defining the area in a way which will be recognised as a new and sensible definition, without extending it to a very much larger area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what is made possible by the Clause. In subsection (2) redefining the area is made possible by Statutory Instrument. The boundary may be extended if, in the light of the experience and the examination which various bodies are now making of economic development problems of the area, that is thought to be necessary. This is the first time that such a thing has been possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman why we should not do it now? Surely he will agree that we do
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
not need to wait for experience, and that developments on the eastern side of the Grampians will be of interest to the new Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We ought to wait for the people who are studying the areas concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is disappointed that I am not vigorous enough these days. At least we have produced a Bill very quickly, and it has provoked more vehemence and more split-mindedness on the part of hon. Gentlemen than did 13 years of Tory rule. There must be something in what we are doing, for it to have created this turbulence, this desire for speech and this passion on the part of hon. Gentlemen. There must be something there, but what it is I would not like to say. We know now that hon. Gentlemen are alive, but we did not even know that under the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) told us that he was mainly concerned with identifying the areas around the seven crofting counties for purposes of inclusion, but that is not what his Amendment does. The hon. Gentleman is one of the two distinguished lawyers in this Committee, but when I look at his Amendments I always wonder and doubt about a lawyer's ability to examine Bills. I thought lawyers were supposed to be experts on this matter and were able to advise on the best way to amend a Bill to achieve a certain result, but the hon. Gentleman's Amendments do not achieve the end he mentions at all. It would be possible under his Amendment to include Galloway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is not his argument, unless this is another case of split-mindedness. In one speech the hon. Gentleman wanted to define all the areas with similar problems, and in another to define the seven crofting counties. He must make up his mind what he wants to do, and then he should consult the other lawyer, his hon. and learned Friend, about how to put his ideas into the Bill. Whether his hon. and learned Friend could do it better than he I do not know, but it is at least worth a trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I said to the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in my first remarks is still true.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
The Bill is not concerned with identifying problems common to certain areas and picking out the areas in which they take place. If it were, it might deal with depopulation, or the fishing industry. There are fishing villages in Berwickshire which have the same problems as fishing villages on the north and the east coasts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Berwickshire villages are nearer the centre of consumption than the villages of Banff. That was the argument on this side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should have to deal with the problems of remoteness, which is not confined to one area. To tackle the problem in this manner would need a kind of Local Employment Act. That is not the purpose of the Bill, which is defined in the Long Title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) produced the same problem, when he asked about a pulp mill. We cannot just situate anywhere in in the Highlands a pulp mill of the kind which is at Fort William. I understand it took two or three years to select this site, that almost every area in the north of Scotland was examined, and that there was not another area in the whole of the Highlands that could have been used for the mill at Fort William. A large number of factors come into these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not concerned with the siting of the present pulp mill. I was concerned with the possibility of a second pulp mill at a future date and the siting of that. I wanted from the hon. Gentleman an assurance that if a major industrial project of this kind were decided upon in future it would not have to be situated in the area covered by the Board to come within the scope of the benefits offered by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were a large undertaking, like a pulp mill, there would be many considerations to be borne in mind. Its main backing would be through the Treasury, but in addition to special assistance there would have to be communication arrangements and the provision of transport facilities. There are limitations on some of these very large undertakings as to where they can be placed. One comes up against these problems all
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
the time. We cannot put these undertakings where we like without consideration of proper facilities being available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that we should look at what the present study groups are doing in the Highland areas and whether we should not use certain boundaries, but the areas covered by the study groups at the present time overlap. There is no clearly defined boundary being considered by the North-East Study Group and the Highlands Study Group. Therefore, that would not have been a practical proposition. For the first time, it will be possible, if necessary, to include Bute in the Highland area, by Statutory Instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurance. Will he state that this problem will definitely be within the terms of reference as soon as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problems of Bute will not be within the terms of reference of the Board, but if the hon. Member can persuade the Scottish Economic Council, the Planning Council, the Board, or the Secretary of State, that this ought to be done because of the necessity or urgency of it, it can be brought about without further legislation. That is a slight advance on the position under the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act, in which that could not have been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have done is to start with an area which is recognisable, one which for administrative purposes has been considered as an area for a great many years, an identifiable area, fixed by certain county boundaries. I do not think there is any insuperable problem about taking in bits of other counties, except that it might create friction and little difficulties with the local authorities concerned, especially if one bit of an area came within the area of the Highland Development Board and other parts did not. Our aim has been to start with something which everybody recognises and with which our administrative machinery has been accustomed to deal. If, as the result of experience gained in the operations of the Board, it is found necessary or desirable to include contiguous areas, which, many of us know, have problems which are similar in character, we can add them by Statutory Instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
In that way, we would be proceeding empirically and redefining the commonly accepted idea of the Highland area. We are not against that. This shows our progressive nature. We were prepared to look at it as soon as we came in. The other Government did not look at it at all, apparently. We see nothing wrong about it. If it ought to be changed for purposes of development, we ought to get on with it. That is possible under the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite should really allow the Clause to stay as it is. They are frightened of what may happen afterwards. I do not know why, but we shall learn about it later. It is not for me to advise them. Let them accept this limited definition, and then, if terrible things transpire, we shall have to ask for other areas to be included. If it is right that other areas should be enabled to enjoy these blessings and boons, hon. Gentlemen can press for their inclusion by statutory order. In other words, they get the best of both worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I should have thought that hon. Gentlemen opposite would be prepared to withdraw the Amendment and allow the subsection to stand as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) to move Amendment No. 7 standing in his name would he advise me how he visualises the financial arrangements in regard to the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Steele, for giving me this opportunity to explain this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is, of course, subject to a Money Resolution, which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>That, for the purposes of any Act of the Session to make further provision for the economic and social development of the Highland and Islands of Scotland it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by Parliament of—
	<ol>
	<li>any expenses incurred by the Secretary of State in making payments in respect of the expenses of a Highland Development Board …;</li>
	<li>any administrative expenses incurred by the Secretary of State under the said Act.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
I think that your difficulty, Mr. Steele, is that an election such as that envisaged in the Amendment would cause certain expense. It seems to me that that expense could be met in one of two ways, either by the Development Board itself, possibly in the event of subsequent elections, or by the Secretary of State, as part of his administrative expenses under the Bill—that is, under paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> of the Money Resolution. In one or the other or both of those ways I suggest that the Amendment is in conformity with the powers conferred by the Money Resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that explanation I will call the hon. Member's Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in line 25, to leave out subsection (4) and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) The Board shall consist of not more than seven members elected by the local government electors for the said area in accordance with rules to be made by the Secretary of State and in making such rules the Secretary of State shall have regard to the population, the distribution and pursuits of the population, the geographical character and the local government boundaries of the several parts of the area, and such other circumstances which appear to him to affect the matter.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Such rules shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be of no effect unless it is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament, and the power to make such rules includes power to vary or revoke them by a subsequent statutory instrument.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of my Amendment is to bring, or to attempt to bring, the Bill into line with ordinary British democratic principles. In this country, in Scotland, we have fought for many years for democracy, both at national and local level, and it seems to me that the Bill is a flagrant breach of that principle, a principle which has permeated and has formed the basis for good government in the United Kingdom for many centuries. What I am proposing is that there should be deleted from the Bill the objectionable words
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall be appointed by the Secretary of State …</p></blockquote>
It seems that that is a complete negation of all the principles we have worked for throughout the centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose in my Amendment that the Board should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"elected by the local government electors for the said area in accordance with rules to be made by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
It will be seen that I am trusting the Secretary of State, as he has been trusted many times before, to lay down rules for the conduct of elections. However, it is essential that the Board should be elected by the people of the area. I go on to provide that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in making such rules the Secretary of State shall have regard"—</p></blockquote>
and here I have used the style provided in the Local Government Act, 1947, for local elections
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the population"—</p></blockquote>
which is a fair way of doing it: the electoral districts will be in proportion to the populations. I go on to suggest, again using the precedent of the 1947 Act, that the right hon. Gentleman
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to … the distribution and pursuits of the population".</p></blockquote>
That is an essential part because, as I said on a previous Amendment, the interests and pursuits of different parts of the Highlands vary enormously. I have compared what I might describe as the Cairngorm and Badenoch areas with life in the Western Isles and they appear to have little in common. There should, therefore, be provision for representation on the Board of representatives of, say, the Western Isles and of the inland parts of the Highland area if we are to achieve a suitable balance on the Board. For that
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
reason I have included the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the distribution and pursuits of the population".</p></blockquote>
The Amendment goes on to refer to "the geographical character of the area" because this is extremely important. As I said when discussing an earlier Amendment, different parts of the area vary radically, from the mountainous parts to those which are as flat as a pancake. It is important to remember that as areas differ geographically, so farming methods differ. Therefore, the Board should be completely representative of all these factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in defining the electoral areas the Secretary of State would require to disregard, to some extent, the ordinary county burghs, but it seems desirable that he should, for administrative reasons, take into account the boundaries of the local government divisions of the area, and that might be done on the basis of district councils. A lot of thought must be given to this matter to achieve the best electoral divisions. Parts of Inverness-shire might be combined with parts of Aberdeenshire or Perthshire to provide a suitable electoral area in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be circumstances which would occur to the Secretary of State in considering this issue with which I have not had time to deal, and therefore I have added a general saving by the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other circumstances which appear to him to affect the matter."</p></blockquote>
Having given a great deal of thought to this subject I hope that this proposal will commend itself to the Committee. If we do not adopt an Amendment of this sort we shall be faced with a very serious situation indeed in the north of Scotland. We shall have a supra-local authority, to call it such, which will come somewhere between the central Government and the county councils and town councils. It will be a local authority of some sort—whether a second tier one, or something of that sort, I do not know—which will not be in conformity with our democratic principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a benevolent Secretary of State in office at some future date, but there may not be. All our thinking for many years has been to give self-government to the various parts of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
the world which we have ruled. Perhaps British rule in the Colonies has been benevolent. However, we have felt that those countries belonged to their peoples, and we have thought it right that they should rule themselves. Why should not the same apply in the north of Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as drafted is absolutely obnoxious. Not only are we going to have a Board set up by the Secretary of State, but we must remember that the Secretary of State indeed has dictatorial powers, since he does not have to answer to anybody. He is not accepting the responsibility himself because he is shelving it off on to the Board. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that this is very much worse than anything the late Adolf Hitler did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is certainly going to great lengths in his democratic argument. He is stretching it to the full. While I agree fully that the Highland interests should be represented, I think that he may be cutting out most valuable representation by limiting it to the actual areas he mentions. After all, there might be an outstanding Highlander who, for reasons we need not go into at the moment, lives away from the Highlands but has an active interest in crofting activities. Would the hon. Gentleman not think it advantageous that such an outstanding individual could be asked to serve on the Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point of view which may be expressed, and perhaps this outstanding Highlander is a qualified person for election to the Board. There are plenty of absentee Highlanders who own vast stretches of land but who live in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the Highlanders would want to elect those absentee landlords, although I very much doubt it. We are back on the old question: is the man who lives outside the Highlands a better man to rule the Highlands than the Highlanders who live in the Highlands? We thought that we could rule the black men in Africa better than they could rule themselves. In recent years our thoughts have changed, and we are allowing the black
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
men in Africa to rule themselves. Further, we—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have been travelling to Ireland and now we have reached Africa. We really ought to confine ourselves to the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Mr. Steele. I come right back to the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highlanders are a proud people, and surely, if we are going to provide rule at any level for them, the people to rule are the Highlanders themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman consider his own position in Parliament? He was recruited from outside the Highland area, his own area, and if he had applied to himself his argument about local democracy he would never have had the opportunity to come here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a bit of it. I am resident in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly I have not laid down who should be elected. All I am saying is that if we are to have a Board of this sort it should be elected by the people who will be ruled by it; the people who are to benefit—or who are supposed to benefit—when it is set up. As I say, the Highlanders are a proud people who have governed themselves in their own peculiar way for a long time. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> When I said "peculiar"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Explain that word away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —I was hoping that lion. Members would realise that "peculiar" has a special meaning in the context. I was using the word in an effort to show that they have a specialised way of running things themselves. But because of geographical considerations and so on, they do not have the financial means to do it and they require an injection of financial help from outside. That is all very well and good, but the Highlanders should be able to elect their own representatives themselves.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest, with respect, Mr. Steele, that the inhabitants of the Highlands are as capable of spending British Government money as are the inhabitants of any other country on the face of the earth. I am suggesting that since the Board will be spending Government money—although, so far as we can gather from the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, it will be a comparatively small sum—the people in the area should have some say in the matter, or certainly their representatives should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face in the Bill an extraordinary position. The people who will do this for the Highlands, who will interfere with local authorities, who will interfere with the businesses being run there and, presumably, who will buy up non-viable farms and make them viable, along with interfering with the crofting way of life, and so on, are people who, it is proposed, should be appointed by the Secretary of State who, under another part of the Bill—which it would be out of order for me to mention at this stage—will have the power to sack them if he thinks that they are unsuitable people for the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This all seems to savour of a Marxist dictatorship. Indeed, it is more serious than that. After all, in the Marxist system—and I am referring, of course, to the dictatorship type of Marxism—I understand that there is a certain amount of representation, through the Soviets, from the bottom to those at the very top. Here, on the other hand, the Board is to be set up by the Secretary of State, from the top, without representation from lower down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to ensure that the Board is representative of the people who live in the areas affected and that those people are able to take an initiative in the election of their representatives on the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is somewhat different, in that it deals with election versus appointment, whereas the others deal with appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this Amendment were carried the hon. Member's Amendment No. 8 would fall. They can all be discussed together because they are related to the Board and to its composition. I think it would be more convenient to the Committee to discuss them together, and the Committee agreed to the suggestion I put to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first heard the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) I thought he had something to offer from all his bubbles of effervescence; but when he rose for the third time today I knew that the bubbles only showed that his argument had finally gone down for and that he had drowned it himself. The argument he put forward has not much recognisable connection with real democracy. I know of no one in the Highlands or even south of the Highlands or, indeed, anyone outside this Committee who has any really serious objection to the proposed method of appointment of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The method has worked well in respect of other Boards and bodies and the Secretary of State is, after all, answerable regarding his action to the House. He can be criticised and made to justify his appointments. He can be criticised for making bad appointments; and he has also powers to undo any mistakes he makes. We can draw the attention of the House of Commons to the mistakes he makes and bring him to account here in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He can make mistakes, but he will have full power to undo them at any time. He may have made some recently, but this is not the time to discuss that. Using

	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
local government electors and election methods rather than general election electors and methods would not be more democratic as the hon. Member appears to think. It would not be a more democratic way of creating the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking today about extending the Parliamentary franchise to young people of 18. The proposal of the hon. Member might well exclude that new body of people if the vote is extended to the 18's in due course for purely Parliamentary purposes. Before the hon. Gentleman talks about democracy and Marxism he should be clear what he means. If we stuck to local government electors and methods we would in practice exclude a large number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that when the Secretary of State makes an appointment he does not consult all the individual electors. He could not. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West must remember that in a local government election it is more than likely there will be a very much lower poll compared with a Parliamentary election and that is why the right of consultation should not be restricted to those people who qualify for and vote in the local elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman tell me how the body of local government electors is smaller than the general body of electors? I would have thought it was larger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In local elections the polls are frequently only 20, 25 or 30 per cent., and that is never really representative of the majority of the people. The majority of the polls are low and even in Glasgow they are sometimes only 17, 20 or 25 per cent. In the Highlands and some islands it is almost impossible for many reasons to get people out for local government elections. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that transport, communications and other difficulties cause low polls. Sometimes it is even difficult to get a candidate, let alone a full expression of democratic feelings and views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another difficulty is how to decide the eligibility of candidates for the Board and who is to select them. Is anyone who wants to go along and say, "I want to be a chairman" or "I want to be a member" to be allowed to become a candi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
date? £10,000 is the highest figure for the Chairman bid so far. Is just anyone to be able to say, "I would like to earn £10,000 as Chairman of the Board"? Or so many thousands as a member? Would the political parties select panels or lists of candidates, as they do to some extent in local government elections as well as for Parliamentary elections, with all the sharp Party differences and divisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely this is particularly undesirable in creating the Board under this Bill and for the purposes of this Bill. I was astonished at the Amendment and also the way the hon. Gentleman extended his argument. He talks most disparagingly about a Bill which every one of his hon. Friends has been concerned to expand. Each one of them has been eagerly trying to take shelter under its provisions and find benefits from it for their own areas, even outside the region. He talks about this Marxist Bill and his answer to Marxist tyranny is a muddled scheme for so-called democratic elections in which only a very limited number of people are ever likely to take part at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I called the hon. Member because I am asking that his Amendment No. 9be included in this discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Mr. Steele, I am coming to that in a moment. I am sorry if you are suggesting that I have not extended my remarks enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member proposed his Amendment uncharacteristically badly. I do not share his view that his Amendments are normally badly framed. We have suffered from some and benefited from other of his Amendments in the past. We benefited from his Private Member's Bill last Session, I agree. He must have sat up far too late at night drafting this particular Amendment, which may explain why it is not as good as usual. He has not had enough sleep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various points of special difficulty must have occurred to himself, too. He tries laboriously to cover them up. For example, he speaks about the pursuits of the population. That, certainly, could cover a very wide range of ideas and activities of all kinds. Are the candidates
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
also to be chosen according to their pursuit of particular activities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This argument about having regard to local people's views would have been far more suitable when the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) moved his Amendment at the beginning of the discussion last Tuesday. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends did give some support in that direction. But I cannot see how a system of narrow local election can deal with regional matters. We are dealing here with national development policy, and national as well as local development. Local electors claim many additional powers and the hon. Gentleman and I have both supported them within their own sphere when dealing with local issues within their too limited terms of reference and their too narrow financial powers. We have often wanted to extend these; but I do not think anyone in our local councils would claim that we should give local electors the power to elect the members of a Development Board. I do not think it is relevant, nor do I know where the hon. Gentleman has got his ideas from. I do not think his argument persuaded anyone on this side nor do I think anyone on his side will support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) should deal with the Amendment seriously at all. It is a wrecking Amendment. It displays a complete lack of comprehension about what the Board is supposed to do. Throughout his speech, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) was blathering. I am not even certain that the Amendment can serve as a vehicle for a constructive debate. While some of us may have some reservations about representative elements on the Board, this is a matter which would arise in a discussion on the composition of the Consultative Council and not in a discussion of the composition of the Board itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I were for a moment to take this argument seriously, which I am reluctant to do, I would still regard seven members elected by local authorities for the area as being bound to be unrepresentative. One of the things which the Board will try to do is to repopulate under-populated areas, and I do not know
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
how we could get seven members who could be properly representative of the unpopulated as well as the populated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) are with us. As you may know, Mr. Steele, members of the Liberal Party have said that we are disturbed by the fact that there are many other hon. Members who are not able to participate in the discussions of the Committee but who have a major interest and who would be here all the time if they were members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main objection to the Amendment is that it is a total misconception of how a development board is made up. We in the Liberal Party have said, and I think that the Government completely agree, that the Board must be composed of highly skilled and professional experts who know about industry, agriculture, transport and administration and who would be able to command high salaries in those occupations. The idea of trying to elect a development board is totally absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with Amendment No. 8 at rather more length than Amendment No. 7 is entitled to. Amendment No. 8 has a better form of wording than the Bill, irrespective of the number of members which it proposes. The Bill says that the Board is to be appointed by the Secretary of State and is to consist of a chairman and not more than six other members, one of whom may be appointed by the Secretary of State as deputy-chairman. It may be possible, although I do not say that it is likely, for it to be argued that it is not the Secretary of State who is to appoint the chairman. This is not clear from the wording of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the example of the Measure which set up the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the wording there is precisely that which I have used and which makes it unequivocally clear that the chairman, deputy-chairman, and all the members of the Board are to be appointed by the Secretary of State. This is a matter of drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been thinking about this as well. Subsection (4)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
says that the Board is to be appointed by the Secretary of State and is to consist of a chairman and not more than six other members, of whom one is to be the deputy-chairman. I would have thought that that included his appointment of the chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, why is it necessary to say that the deputy-chairman is to be appointed by the Secretary of State? If it is necessary to say that the deputy-chairman has to be appointed by the Secretary of State, why is it not necessary also to say that of the chairman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to destroy the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I would have thought that the wording covered the appointment of the Board as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a strong point of this, but the new form seems to be clearer and it also has the precedent of the Act which I have mentioned. I am not a lawyer or an expert in wording but I believe that it is wise to be as clear as possible in view of the rather tendentious nature of the legal profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major issue is the size of the Board itself. We feel that it is important that it should be small. In our policy statement on Highland development we said that the membership should be as small as three, comparable with the composition of the Tennesee Valley Authority. However, I have not proposed reducing the number to three simply because I think that the fact that the Government have suggested a chairman and six others means that they are more or less of a mind to make the Board somewhat larger than that. I have proposed that the number should be not more than five members in the hope that the Government might seriously consider and even accept the suggestion. They could reasonably accept a reduction to a total of five members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, one quality person is worth three or four or five mediocrities. The greater the number on the Board, the less likely it is that the Board will consist entirely of persons of true quality. It will be very difficult to find people for the Board at all. The Minister knows this and I sympathise with him about it, but, that being the case, if the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
accept, as they must, that the quality and calibre of members of the Board must be of the highest, it is reasonable to say that the number should be as small as possible. This is not a new argument. The hon. Member for the Western Isles will remember that when before the war the idea of development commissioners was suggested, it was proposed that there should be only one person, or perhaps two, with very wide powers similar to those now being proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the Board should be a small professional body. This would not impair its functioning, but it would ensure that the high salaries to be paid to these people were paid to good people. It is very important for the Highlands that they should be good people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure, Mr. Steele, whether Amendment No. 65—in page 1, line 26, at end insert "full-time"—is also included for discussion now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That will be considered in another group, but the hon. Member may make a passing reference to it, but a passing reference only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not make a passing reference to it out of respect for the great efforts which you have made to keep discussion relevant this morning, Mr. Steele. Amendment No. 10 is under discussion now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 10 touches on nothing which is fundamental. I see that one of the big guns is to be deployed, but I do not think that this Amendment is tremendously important. I suppose that in certain circumstances it could be argued that if the Board itself appointed the deputy chairman, this would be a kind of lever against a chairman who, for some reason, had become out of sympathy with the rest of the Board. This is an unlikely although extremely undesirable situation. It would be much better if both the chairman and the deputy chairman were appointed by the Secretary of State at the beginning with this degree of seniority clearly stated at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a very small Board of only seven or, as I would hope, of only five members it would be difficult to have elections or discussions about who was to be deputy chairman, and I believe that both
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
the chairman and the deputy chairman would be better appointed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I again earnestly appeal to the Minister to consider whether it would not be progressive to reduce the size of the Board still further. As I have said, it will be difficult to get acceptable people of the right calibre and in that situation the money to be spent on salaries would be better spent on five good folk than in adding a couple of extras.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard many strange statements from the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) but this morning's was the strangest of all. He said that his Amendment sought to bring the Bill into line with modern democratic methods. He appeared to be trying to jump on the bandwagon of home rule for the Highlands after having seen the result of the by-election yesterday when that policy appeared to pay dividends. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to cash in on it. He went on to say that the Secretary of State was a dictator. Has he forgotten that the Secretary of State is a Member of Parliament and is answerable to Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the hon. Gentleman forgotten bodies which already exist in Scotland and which are comparable with that which he has suggested? For instance, there is the Counties of Cities Association, which is composed of people who reside in their own areas but who, at meetings of the Association, are the slowest at taking decisions of any group of people one has come across. Another similar body is the Convention of Royal Burghs. It will not allow representatives to speak for their own councils without having first consulted them, so that decisions are enormously delayed. I gave up going to its meetings because I regarded them as a waste of time. One could find five agendas in succession mentioning the same items and it was rare to find an item not mentioned on two agendas. This is the system which the hon. Gentleman wants and which he describes as a modern and democratic method of getting something done in the Highlands. It is about the worst possible system, and I can speak of it, not from imagination, but from experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not speak about modern democracy. I said that this had been our system for many centuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our system for many centuries has been that local people elect local councils to look after local problems and at the same time elect people, perhaps from outside the district, at Parliamentary elections to deal with national problems on a national scale. That is democracy as it works today and in many ways it is successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A parallel with the system advocated in the Bill is that used for the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. It is elected in exactly the way as that is proposed in the Bill. This body has done more to develop the Highlands than any other single organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Highlands and Islands are to be developed in the best way for the people living there we must develop them in a way which will fit into a national plan. This can be done only by a board established in the way proposed by the Bill. My party has continually stated that industry must be spread throughout the country. That requires a national plan. It cannot be done on a purely local basis, by locally elected people. This has been tried in the past, and has failed miserably. Local councils have been in being for a long time, but have failed completely to do anything for the benefit of the Highlands. But the Hydro-Electric Board has shown how beneficial developments can be created in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that we can do two things here. We can help the area and also help the national plan in spreading industry and employment throughout the country. The weakness of the plans continually advocated by the "Home Rule for Scotland" people is that if we had home rule for these counties they could never raise the finance to put in hand the type of schemes required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is now going rather wide of the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Can we assume that when hon. Members invoke comparisons which might not be immediately related to the Amendment they are not necessarily out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) was invoking comparisons which I did not rule out of order, but I thought that he had reached a point at which he was out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Steele, for interpreting my remarks as being conclusive to the extent that no further examples are necessary. I will not prolong the argument in those circumstances, as everybody appears to be convinced by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the other point mentioned by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), it does not make a great deal of difference what are the actual numbers on the Board, so long as it is reasonably small. It will not make much difference if it consists of four, five or seven members. The point is that we have a good precedent, which is already tried and proved, which can operate for the benefit of the remoter areas. On the basis of that experience I am convinced that we can go ahead and take another big step forward in developing this neglected area of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. A. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will confine my remarks to Amendment No. 10, which aims to allow the Board to elect its own deputy chairman. Under the provisions of the Bill there need not be a deputy chairman, but if there is one he will be appointed by the Secretary of State. I am sure that the Minister will be able to inform us whether precedents are to be found, but whichever way we look at the matter—whether we think that the Board should appoint or elect its own deputy chairman, or that the Secretary of State should—I know that in the case of the Cereals Authority the appointment of the Deputy Chairman is made by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the hon. Member inform us, for example, what the position is in respect of some of the many bodies with which the Highlands and Islands Development Board will work, or which it will supersede? I am not certain whether there is a Deputy Chairman on the Highland Panel, the Crofters Commission, the White Fish Authority or the Herring Board. I do not know whether precisely the same powers exist in their constitutions in respect of the election of a deputy chairman, and whether the appointment is by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
It may be that the Minister will tell us that precisely the same situation exists in respect of those bodies as is now proposed. He could call in aid as an argument the maintenance of the 	<i>status quo.</i> Even if he does, however, I would favour a break away on this occasion, because one of the criticisms made of the Bill by my hon. Friends is that the Board has continually to refer matters to the Secretary of State. Because of this the Minister and his right hon. Friend have said that hon. Members on this side of the Committee seem anxious to give powers to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find a significant difference between "power" and "responsibility". In this instance it would be a healthy thing to give the Board the responsibility—not the power—of electing or appointing its own deputy chairman. That would be a compromise between the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) who is quite content to side with the Government in favour of a 100 per cent, appointment by them. It would be a good gesture—and good for the Board itself, even if no other precedent existed—to allow the new Board to strike out on what might be new ground by taking this responsibility to itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spend too much time on the Amendment. I agree very much with the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) that this is a wrecking Amendment. It is a rather stupid Amendment, moved by a rather stupid Member. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) was characteristically too kind to the hon. Member. The hon. Member engaged in. the sort of extravagant talk that was indulged in by the former Secretary of State when the Bill was originally introduced—talk of Marxism, Hitlerism, dictatorship and the rest—and then pleaded, strangely enough, the merits of democracy. The hon. Member is the last fellow that I would choose as a protagonist of democracy. For weeks the party opposite has been blocking a Bill of mine concerning the Deans of Guild and the deacons convener. This is a strange way to express their sympathy and enthusiasm for democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
In fact, the leadership of the Tory Party is only just getting round to democracy, and it ill becomes hon. Members opposite to plead democracy when talking about elections to this Board. I do not take that argument seriously, and I do not think that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) does. I hope that the Highlands people recognise the characteristics of it, however, and the filibustering tactics of the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles said, all kinds of difficulties arise here, not only in connection with the election of candidates but also with the regularity of elections. How often shall we have them? Who will control—and how?—the expenses of candidates? How can we guarantee, in the form of a democratic election, that all the interests will be represented on a geographical or any other basis? The hon. Member for Inverness may argue that the Liberal Party, as an organisation, should be represented on the Board, especially in view of recent happenings. There are all kinds of difficulties. If, as he has said, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West has given a good deal of thought to this, I am very concerned about the state of his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) talked about the Bill's not providing the certainty of the election of a deputy-chairman. I agree that there is no guarantee of this in the Bill—but the Amendment does not guarantee it, either. I should have thought that if hon. Members opposite wanted to be certain of this they would have sought to substitute "shall" for "may", in line 1 at the top of page 2. We must think about this, because it is important, first, that there
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
should be a chairman and a deputy-chairman and, secondly, that there should be a balancing of interests. It may be that the chairman will lend his support, experience and ability to one aspect of the Highland problem, in which case the Secretary of State should ensure that the deputy-chairman represents, and has experience and knowledge of, other aspects, so that there is a balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the Board is clearly a matter of judgment. The hon. Member for Inverness had a point when he said that it is of paramount importance to have on the Board men and women of the highest quality, but it is rather a reflection upon the quality of the human products of the Highlands to suggest that such people cannot be found there. He adduced that as an argument for reducing the number of members on the Board. This is a matter of judgment. Above a certain size, the bigger the organisation the more dilatory it is in coming to decisions, and the more difficult it is to get all the members together. We must strike a balance. If it is too small it tends to become dictatorial or, perhaps, overworked. I am prepared to leave this question to the judgment of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the size of the body, however, in my opinion all its members should be full-time. There is a later Amendment dealing with this point. My hon. Friend would do well to think again about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
