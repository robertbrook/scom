	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [15th April],</i> in page 2, line 29, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(e) having regard to the recommendations of the Highland Transport Board and in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Minister of Transport to prepare and submit urgently a transport plan for the Highlands and Islands."—	<i>[Mr. Russell Johnston.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was at the point which looked like an interim peroration, but, in the interests of progress, I am prepared to make it the peroration for the whole of my speech. I am sure that I have made the points in favour of the Amendment and if the Minister can give us an indication of his views at an early stage, it might save time and also serve the purpose of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment at first sight might seem rather attractive because it deals with something which is of exceptional importance in the Highlands. However, it is misconceived, in as much as its purpose is already achieved in paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(d)</i> of the subsection. Those paragraphs permit the Board to do precisely what the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) wishes it to do, and there is, therefore, no need for his Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, this is a matter of selecting one aspect for mention while not mentioning many other important aspects, equally important in many cases. If we were to provide that the Board should urgently submit a transport plan, we ought also to include that it should submit a land use plan, or a tourism plan, or an industrial plan, or an education plan, or something else. All these things are equally important and it would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
quite wrong to select one aspect while leaving out these others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness asked what would happen to the Highland Transport Board. The Transport Board is now engaged in a comprehensive study of transport in the Highlands and Islands and its remit is to make recommendations for an adequate, efficient and integrated transport system. Its report will be available within a year to 18 months. It is proposed to allow the Transport Board to complete its remit. What will happen then is that the Highland Development Board will take over from the Transport Board the function of keeping under constant review all transport matters in the Highlands. In other words, the work now being done by the Transport Board will be carried on by the Development Board when the Transport Board has completed its present remit. The report of the Transport Board is to be a report to the Secretary of State and the Minister of Transport, but on completion it will be made available to the Development Board in the same way as the report on the study of the Highlands, now being made for the Secretary of State, will be available to the Development Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the light of these considerations hon. Members will agree that the Amendment hardly seems necessary. It would call into question the Board's other functions. The Board's terms of reference are sufficiently wide to include all these matters and the Amendment would weaken rather than strengthen the Clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness will consider withdrawing the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances, but I should like to be a little further assured. There is a distinction between powers and intentions and between powers and obligations. As the Bill is drafted the Board has power to do all these things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An obligation to do them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it an obligation to look at MacBrayne's, for example; at the problem of the railway line which the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) mentioned? Has it an obligation to consider sea services or to pay subsidies for uneconomic lines which might be important in terms of a future
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
economic revival? Certainly it has the power to do these things, but I am sure that, like myself, the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) would like to be assured that the Board will contain an obligation to tackle such things as the problem of rural bus services and that that will not be a problem left to the Minister of Transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me refer the hon. Member to the wording of the Clause. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In pursuance of their general function described in section 1(1) of this Act the Board shall have the following duties"—</p></blockquote>
the word is "duties" and duties are obligations—
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>(a)</i> to keep under review all matters relating to the economic and social well-being and development of the Highlands and Islands"—</p></blockquote>
all matters—
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>(d)</i> to advise the Secretary of State on such matters relating to their functions as he may refer to the Board or as the Board may think fit."</p></blockquote>
If the Board thinks fit, it can advise the Secretary of State on matters concerning transport. I think that that is the answer to the hon. Member's questions. All these things are obligations. This provision is not permissive, but mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Development Board takes over from the Transport Board as the latter passes into oblivion, having reported, is there to be any specific duty laid upon the Development Board to pursue the recommendations which the report of the Transport Board will presumably contain? This is what is important to us in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, for example, the Secretary of State is rather remotely in contact with MacBrayne's. Operationally there has been no sort of effective Government control of MacBrayne's whatever. It has been controlled entirely by the shipping directors, and the Government's directors are responsible mainly for keeping an eye on the public financial interest, not on controlling or running the services operationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will remember that the Labour Party is clearly committed, in writing as well as in many Election speeches, to ensuring that assistance is given to rural bus services in areas where
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
it is not profitable or possible in the ordinary commercial way to run them wholly through private enterprise. It would be helpful to know whether it is the Board which will have responsibilities in that connection in the Highlands. As a regional development board it should have a specific duty to help to prepare an integrated transport plan suitable to the area for the development of which it is to be responsible. Again, we are fairly clearly committed as a party to such a policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to know that it is now to be a definite duty of the Board, when it takes over from the Highland Transport Board, to help to implement acceptable recommendations in the report of the Transport Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural bus services are a touchy subject in the Highlands and Islands. They have an impact at every point in the whole social and economic life of the Highlands and Islands. There is no doubt that in some areas road transport services have deteriorated and that the bus service systems throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands have been deteriorating as it has become less and less profitable to run them. At the same time, all parties represented in this Committee recognise the need for having a suitable bus transport system in rural areas. That, indeed, is part of the solution of the problem of depopulation, especially for younger people. The Board should, therefore, be clearly committed not only to assisting in tackling the problem of the maintenance of rural bus services and the improvement of the sea services and other problems connected with transport, but also in producing an integrated plan for the whole of the area for the development of which it is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is true that to specify is to appear to exclude, nevertheless, in later Clauses the Bill specifies land acquisition and use and all sorts of things to do with land, and it is not altogether a good thing that transport as such should not be mentioned specifically in the Bill. It touches on every aspect of the development of the Highlands and Islands. That is the reason for the Amendment and that is why I am supporting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout the Clause the references to the Board's duties are concerned with the Secretary of State,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
and the fact that the Secretary of State is specified might appear to exclude Ministers who are also concerned with transport. All matters of land transport are properly directed to the Secretary of State, but aviation is an important aspect of transport in which the status of the Secretary of State for Scotland is non existent, because there is a Minister of Aviation. Do we assume that references to the Secretary of State will also involve references to the Minister of Aviation? Is it reasonable to expect that the Minister of Aviation should be mentioned, particularly in view of a most interesting development which is now under way and which is completely out of the compass of the duties and powers of the Secretary of State? Can my hon. Friend the Minister of State make that aspect of the matter a little clearer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been discussing what the Highland Development Board may or may not do about transport. About a month ago it was decided that a railway line in the Cairngorms winter sports area, a line which also goes across Dava Moor, should be closed. This is across a very high part in the foothills of the Cairngorms. The decision was announced about four days before the Minister of Transport said that in future such decisions would not be taken without consultation first with the development boards concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in this area, local authorities and others, are concerned to know whether the closing of this railway line will be considered by the Development Board. There is nothing to stop this decision from being carried out before the Board is even in existence. The Minister of State ought to be able to tell us whether the Board is to have an opportunity to consider this decision. I will not expand this further, for the Minister of State should know the case to which I am referring. The point is that the alternative services which have been suggested are highly doubtful. There is great concern about whether the services will be adequate or whether they will be able to continue through the winter months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), like myself, would be glad to have an assurance that the Board's functions will in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
clude a consideration of whether the alternative services will be adequate, especially as they include a bus service on a route where there has not previously been one at all and because Dava Moor is covered with snow and ice in the winter which will make conditions for such transport very difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the latter point, the Board is not yet set up and it is not likely to be set up for another two or three months. I am not certain that the question raised by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) is altogether relevant to this discussion. Clearly, the Secretary of State still has the power, as he had previously under the Conservative Government, to make representations about that, if the social and economic case is such that he thinks that it should be presented to the Minister of Transport. That was the position. It is still the position. It can still be done. As I understand it, representations can be made by anybody to the Minister of Transport concerning these aspects in as much as they are not considered by the T.U.C.C. However, I do not think that the issue is altogether relevant to this discussion, because the Board is not yet set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board would hardly interfere if there were no Board to do anything. Something which is nonexistent can hardly do something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but this is why many people in the area feel that by four days the line has missed the opportunity of coming under the Minister of Transport's edict that in future such decisions will not be taken unless the regional planning boards have been consulted. The question which is in everybody's mind in the area is, will the carrying out of the decision be delayed till the Board is in existence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reference here is to the Economic Planning Council rather than the Highland Development Board. It can recommend on these matters at present. This is what the hon. Gentleman is referring to rather than to the Highland Development Board. In future, after the Board has been set up and once it has taken over the functions of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
the Highland Transport Board, it will be able to make representations to the Secretary of State as to the importance and desirability of maintaining a particular service. Meanwhile, I think that I am correct in saying that the Highland Transport Board can do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the other points raised. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) is altogether correct in saying that MacBrayne's is only remotely controlled by the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend has recently been making representations in regard to certain of the services of MacBrayne's. The Secretary of State has to approve the schedules, the charges, the services and everything else. He is the person who approves these things and representations can be made to him, as my hon. Friend has made representations in connection with one service. The Government directors of MacBrayne's are full directors playing a full part in MacBrayne's. They play a very important part too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the Highland Development Board and transport in the Highlands as a whole, we must start from the general conception of the Board, that the Board is not taking over the functions of existing statutory bodies or organisations, nor, for that matter, the functions of existing Ministries. There are a large number of Ministries operating in the Highlands. It is not the function of the Board to take over the functions of the Minister of Transport or the responsibilities of the Secretary of State in respect of roads, for instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board will be able to consider and recommend on matters which arise either from the Highland Transport Board's report or from the matters which it is considering at the time. It will be able to make recommendations to the Secretary of State that this is necessary, that that is necessary, or that something else is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed that in fact the provisions of the Bill are wide enough to permit the Board to subsidise rural bus services if it thinks that they are necessary and desirable for what it is doing. This is possible under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
That is the relationship of the Highland Development Board to the Secretary of State and to the Minister of Transport. As I have said, there are other Ministries operating in the Highlands—for instance, the Board of Trade. It is not proposed to interfere with the Board of Trade. It is not proposed to take over its functions. Similarly, it is not proposed to take over the functions of the Ministry of Transport. The relationship is that if the Board, as the result of its examination, makes certain recommendations to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State has the power to pursue them with the Ministry of Transport or, if they fall within his own jurisdiction, to pursue them himself. If the Development Board makes particular proposals or presents the Secretary of State with schemes which are approved by him, if they involve roads there is an obligation on the Secretary of State, who has approved the plans, to ensure that the aspects relating to transport falling within his jurisdiction are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with all the points raised in the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with the point I raised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same answer applies. It is not proposed to take over the functions of the Ministry of Aviation in the Highlands. The Board will be able to make representations relating to services and such matters to the Secretary of State, who has the power to make representations to the Ministry of Aviation. Most things go through the Secretary of State in respect of this aspect of transport services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister of State for his reply. We have established three things. We have established, first, that the Board will definitely be directly involved in transport. We have established, secondly, that if it is necessary it will be empowered to pay subsidies to assist particular forms of transport. I think that is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thirdly, it will also definitely take over the existing rôle of the Highland Transport Board when that Board ultimately presents its report and goes out of existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of those assurances, I beg to ask leave, with the agreement of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), who has also signed the Amendment, to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 33, to leave out "calendar" and to insert "financial".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 13 the Board is to present to Parliament via the Secretary of State its accounts for the financial year. If the annual report were issued to cover the same period as the accounts of the Board it would be very much easier for those who study these things to correlate the two. The Minister of State may say that other nationalised Boards report annually in the calendar year, but I have noticed that the latest Report of the National Coal Board was from the end of December, 1962, to 28th March, 1964. It may well be that that Board is moving into line with what I would like to see here, namely, the publication of the report to coincide with the financial year and the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We gave a considerable amount of thought to this and came down on the side of the calendar year, for good reasons. Most of the reports of Departments are for the calendar year. The report of the Crofters Commission is for the calendar year. The report of the Deer Commission is for the calendar year. This has certain advantages from a parliamentary point of view in particular. It means that we have the opportunity of debating reports which are up to date. The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) probably has not had this experience yet, but later this Session he will find that we have six Estimates days, in addition to two Motion days. The debates on the six Esimates days are usually based on reports of Departments or committees—of the Crofters Commission or some other body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the report is for the calendar year, it is possible for the report to have been published so that the Committee, when it discusses the report, is discussing a report for the previous year. If the report is for the financial year, the trouble is, the financial year ending in April,
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
that the report is not usually published until after the Estimates debates. Therefore, we would find ourselves, if we wished to discuss this in the course of our Scottish Estimates debates, discussing a report which was 18 months to 2 years out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances debates at times tend to be unreal. We have sometimes had certain difficulties when we have tried to discuss the Forestry Commission. This is one of the difficulties from a Parliamentary point of view. By the use of an annual report based on the calendar year we obviate that. It is widely practised and there are very few difficulties in regard to the financial aspects of such a report, because the report is not usually concerned so much with detailed financial aspects. It is concerned with the cost of particular schemes, which is rather different from the annual financial aspects with which the Comptroller and Auditor-General is concerned. There are no great difficulties in that respect. We think that in practice it would be much better for the reports to be based on the calendar year rather than on the financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister of State's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 38, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any advice given by the Board to the Secretary of State under section 3(1)	<i>(d)</i>".</p></blockquote>
As the Minister of State has just said, the annual report provides Parliament with the opportunity of considering what the Board, when it has come into existence, has been doing and, if it wishes to, of debating the report or subjects in it. The Clause as drafted stipulates that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"report shall set out any directions given to the Board under section 2(1)",</p></blockquote>
that is, directions by the Secretary of State to the Board. We believe that it is important that advice which the Board may have tendered to the Secretary of State under subsection (1,	<i>d</i>) should also be included in the report to Parliament and to the public. Parliament should have the opportunity of learning in due course what the Board has suggested as advice in the category of paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> to the Secretary of State during the previous 12 months.

As the Clause is drafted at present it seems to be another aspect of the one-way traffic from the Secretary of State to the Board. As we have pointed out before, we feel that too much power is in the hands of the Secretary of State and too little discretion is given to the Board. Here again, we find the Board is enjoined to report on the directions given by the Secretary of State, but is not asked to include in its report any advice which the Board itself may have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Board consists of members of high quality and imagination, as we hope it will, we feel sure it will have advice and suggestions to make, and we consider this is a very important part of the Board's rôle. This function of making suggestions and giving advice to the Secretary of State on matters which may not be entirely within its own scope to do, without assistance from other bodies, is an important aspect of its work. Therefore we suggest that it should be written into the Bill, though it is clear it is a matter which could be included in the annual report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think if the hon. Gentleman really thinks this out he will not press this Amendment. It would place an obligation on the Board to publish any advice which it might give to the Secretary of State, advice which might be varied in character and some of which might be very confidential. Some of the advice the Board itself would not want to be published, and if we insist on the publication of any advice tendered by the Board to the Secretary of State the Board might quite well feel inhibited in what it advises the Secretary of State to do. In that way this Amendment might well prove to be rather restrictive on what the hon. Gentleman himself desires, that is for the Board to advise the Secretary of State in a competent manner, in a way that might be done by the men of imagination which he mentions, though I do not know that everybody wants their imaginative ideas published. They may well be prepared to give them in private.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the point that they might be asked for advice or might give advice which would be confidential in character, some proposal to set up a business or something of a character that would not usually be published concerning a busi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
ness or some action the Board proposes to take or that the Secretary of State might think it should take. This, in our view, would be undesirable. Some of the advice might cause a certain amount of local embarrassment to the Board itself, or some embarrassment with the local Authorities. I think there are difficulties in this, and it would be restrictive and inhibiting on the Board if it were placed under an obligation to publish its advice. For these reasons I am afraid I must resist this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister is not making rather heavy weather of this. One knows that in practice the Board will be in fairly constant touch with St. Andrew's House, and will have a great many opportunities for consultations and discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) and many of us feel is that if the Board, after careful thought, decides formally to give advice to the Secretary of State on something it thinks is important, it should be a duty, if the hon. Gentleman thinks it correct, to include it in the report. There are many things of a confidnetial nature on which formal advice of this nature is not always necessary or, I agree, always desirable, but these can be dealt with in the ordinary run of business consultation between civil servants, assessors to the Board and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe the Amendment would have this restrictive effect. From time to time the Board may well find itself in some rather fundamental disagreement in principle between the sort of action which it feels is necessary for the Highlands and the sort of action which the Secretary of State, perhaps, to give an example, feels he could not persuade his collagues to pay for. The fact that the Board could and had a duty to state in its report that it had formally given the Secretary of State advice that such and such a thing would be a great benefit for the Highlands would help the Board to crystallise public opinion behind it, to bring pressure, political or social, on the Secretary of State of the time, and would perhaps help him to obtain the necessary consent from his colleagues to get the thing done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is right in saying that if we write these words into the Bill at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
this point it will mean that every time a member of the Board decides that something would be a good idea and writes to his opposite number in St. Andrew's House all this has to be published, I would entirely agree with the Minister. Perhaps he will think about my point, that there may be occasions when specific policy decisions which the Board feels are important should be in the report, even though the Secretary of State does not agree with the Board, and if it has the power to do that, and the duty to do that, the point of our Amendment is met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to prevent the Board from publishing in its report advice it tenders. That power exists in the Bill at present, but the right hon. Gentleman knows very welll that whilst public bodies do this in their reports the use of this power is one which has to be made effective in a very careful manner, otherwise we shall have conflict between the Secretary of State and the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is consistently carried on the Secretary of State simply adapts himself to the circumstances as he finds them—is this not human nature?—and we do not get the desired result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with this Amendment is that it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any advice given by the Board to the Scretary of State".</p></blockquote>
In other words, it becomes obligatory upon the Board to publish any advice given to the Secretary of State. I should have thought it would be much better to leave to the good sense of the Board what it publishes and does not publish. The Board, if it consists of the intelligent and imaginative men the hon. Gentleman spoke about, will use this power wisely. It has the power to do this in the Bill, and I think we should leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will be good enough to look at this again. I think the trend of his objection to this Amendment is that the words as they stand put an obligation on the Board to publish 	<i>in toto</i> all advice put by the Board to the Secretary of State. Quite clearly, if that were so, that would be an undesirable course.
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
There are many matters which will have to remain confidential if the Board is to fulfil its functions properly. It would be wrong to put the Board in such a position that it would have to publish in its report confidential business information obtained under Clause 11 as a result of a direction given under Clause 2 by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time there must surely be a form of words which would meet the point my right hon. and hon. Friends and I put, an obligation on the Board to publish in the report advice of a general nature, so that the public would be able each year to discern where the two-way movement of ideas between the Secretary of State and the Board is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the Minister says the Board can publish information if it wishes. I presume that is under paragraph 	<i>(e),</i> by which the Board has power to produce a report on the exercise and performance of its functions. I presume that is the umbrella part to which he refers. With great respect, is that sufficient? One can envisage a situation in which a Secretary of State might give a general direction under Clause 2 of this Bill which the members of the Board might regard as an intolerable direction. This is conceivable. This is the point I made on Second Reading. If they were to feel that, surely it would be necessary in the interest of Highland progress and the avoidance of possible conflict between the Secretary of State and the Board for the communications between the Board and the Secretary of State to be published. Without that, Parliament and the public cannot get a complete view of the transaction of ideas between the Board and the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In connection with the remarks we have just heard from the hon. Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Mac-Arthur), I think the Committee has to remember that by the Amendment any advice given by the Board to the Secretary of State under the Clause would need to be published. It appears to me the hon. Gentleman really wanted to amend the Amendment. There was similarity also between his views and those expressed by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the dilemma they are placed in. As the debate has proceeded,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
and as my hon. Friend has answered the points made, we have seen the great possibility that this Amendment, if adopted, would restrict ideas coming from the Board. The Board could be confronted with a very difficult problem, perhaps economic, or perhaps in connection with local authority work in an area where a development scheme was being devised. If it were obligatory for the Board to publish any advice at all, any contact with the Secretary of State, it might hesitate to give that advice, while, as the position rests in the Bill, the Board has the onus of deciding what will be published in the report and what advice to give to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Gentleman opposite will agree, on reflection, that this is the best way to tackle this job. Obviously if some of us were to feel at a later date that the Board was holding things back which we should debate we would voice those objections in the House. However, my great fear would be that, to some extent, we would stultify ideas coming from the Board which could be helpful in formulating policy. Therefore, we should be very wary about taking any action which would stultify in the very early stages the proposals being brought forward by the Board and advice asked by it of the Secretary of State. I do think it would be best to leave it so that the Board has complete freedom to publish its own Report in its own way and any advice it gives to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point which is being slightly overlooked in this—and it is quite understandable—is that once this Board is functioning, the Board's members will really be the experts on the Highlands. It is not going to be easy to redevelop the Highlands. However, it is the Board and its members who are really going to know far more about what the Highlands need and what can be done to improve various areas, and so on. They are going to know far more about it than any Secretary of State. They are going to know far more about it than any Secretary of State's officials. They are going to be the experts. Surely when these experts really get in the saddle, get into the way of doing their job properly, and get to the stage of making formal advice to the Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
of State, something pretty important is happening. If it should be the case that the Secretary of State, whoever he may be in the future, should consistently, for perhaps very good other reasons, block this advice or prevent the funds from coming forward to carry out this advice, then surely it would be most useful to the Board if it were able to say, "We have a statutory obligation to publish this fact that we have given you these pieces of advice". It would then be able to make it clear it had given this advice and that it had been blocked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I would say that he has missed the salient point, in so far as the Board can publish any advice it cares to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct. I was going to cover that very point in my next few words. It may be said, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, that it can do this. However, suppose the Board were to find itself continually frustrated by future Secretaries of State. It might be put under pressure for very good reasons by that Secretary of State saying, "You can understand why I cannot agree to your proposals and I would ask that they be not published"—due to some very good reason. The Board could then come back to the Secretary of State and say, "We are sorry, but we are given the responsibility of developing the Highlands and we have an obligation to make clear what proposals we are putting forward and these are being blocked by the Secretary of State". I would like to make it quite clear that I am not casting any aspersions on the present Secretary of State or the present Administration. We have got to look far further ahead than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, suppose this Board were to find itself with a lot of good ideas which were consistently being frustrated, it would help the Board to have the obligation to publish this, and for everybody to know it had this obligation to publish it. In this case there could be no question at all that these pieces of advice, which were being frustrated, could be made public, and public opinion could assist the Board to bring home the needs of particular areas of the Highlands.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
I would suggest to the Minister of State that if he considers that very carefully there would be nothing to lose and a certain amount, at the very least, to gain by accepting this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to the hon. Gentleman that in his remarks, with which I largely agree, he was in reality talking to Amendment No. 21, and so was confining his argument very much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reply to that. There is nothing to prevent the Board from putting this in its Report. In fact, from my memory of Reports—take the Crofters Commission Reports of the past years—I would say they have been full of things which ought to be done. They have recommended changes in legislation. They have said that they find great difficulty here, there and everywhere but they appreciate that this cannot be done without legislation. Alternatively, they suggest that something else ought to be done. The Crofters Commission Reports—and I speak from memory, but I think this is correct—have been full of suggestions of this kind; in other words, they have stated quite clearly matters which ought to be taken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what happens. There is nothing to prevent the Board, if it thinks that certain things ought to be done, from saying they ought to be done in its Report. I cannot imagine that a Board is going to start a big public fight with the Secretary of State. What it does, in actual practice, is to say in its Report, "We believe the time has now come for such and such an action. We are limited by this, that and the other." It might be finance or it might be regulation. In the case of a Board like this, it may say that the lack of transport facilities has prevented the development of this particular area. Of course, all this serves to keep Members of Parliament as well as the public informed of the things they want done. Quite clearly, arising out of that, Members of Parliament are going to ask the Secretary of State whether he will take powers to do this, whether he will provide money, or whether he will consider this. This is what happens in case after case. This seems to me to be the right way. After all, who is going to decide what the Board wants to publish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board is going to decide what it wants to publish. It has that power, and it is the only one. If we place an obligation on the Board to publish advice, then, as I said in my opening remarks, it may be rather careful about some of the advice it offers to the Secretary of State because it will have in its mind the fact that it will have to publish it. When it submits its advice, it will say, "This will not look too good in the Report, so we had better delete it." Therefore, it is inhibiting upon the Board to make this obligatory. That seems to me to be quite obvious when we come to consider how it would work out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I think we would be better to leave the powers as they are in the Bill. The Board, if it wishes, has the power in the Bill to put in its Report advice it has tendered to the Secretary of State; nothing can stop it. However, if it feels that for quite good reasons—and there are a lot of good reasons, and I have mentioned a number of them this morning—certain things ought not to be published, it should be in the position not to publish them. Therefore, I would not like to see put into the Bill any obligations upon the Board to publish all its advice. I believe that it would be detrimental to the working of the Board. It would be a bad thing for the relationship between the Board and the Secretary of State. It would inhibit the Board in much of its advice. In fact, I do not think it would achieve anything in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister of State has rejected this Amendment for two reasons: first, that some of the advice may well be of a confidential nature and therefore it might be embarrassing to publish it; secondly, that the Board can in any case publish what it likes and is not debarred from publishing this. I understand both those points. However, what I want to point out is that both these can apply to what is already written into the Bill concerning the directions given by the Secretary of State. It may well be that conversations between officials at St. Andrew's House and the Board may be of a confidential nature giving guidance, and we would not expect those to be included. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
would only expect the formal directions of the Secretary of State to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Board can, in any case, publish this if it wishes to do so. Both these points apply to that. None the less, there is written into the Clause the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"such report shall set out any directions given to the Board under section 2(1) of this Act."</p></blockquote>
I realise there may be more difficulty in the case of advice under paragraph 	<i>(d),</i> that this advice may contain some confidential points at various times, whereas the general directions of the Secretary of State and the guidance given by his officials may not run into as many difficulties of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman remember this? The Secretary of State has a responsibility to the House of Commons for the directions he gives to the Board. The Board has no responsibility to the House of Commons for the advice it offers to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand that, and the fact that there are ways of testing the Secretary of State upon his responsibilities to the House of Commons. I realise, too, that it is unnecessary to have to wait for a year till the Report is published before one can do that—fortunately. I was only pointing out that the two arguments the hon. Gentleman has given do apply to the part written in concerning the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept the confidentiality point, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said, we were considering in this Amendment the formal advice which the Board would decide to give to the Secretary of State under paragraph 	<i>(d),</i> and not the day-today business transacted between the assessors of the Board and officials at St. Andrew's House, and so on. I understand from what the Minister has said that the placing of a comprehensive obligation on the Board might cause difficulties of the kind the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. Looking at this Clause, we thought it was unbalanced in as much as it was a one-way traffic matter, and I would still hope that the hon. Gentleman would consider before the next stage whether a more limited obligation might be in order. He has not argued against that. He has argued against the obliga-
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
tion that is in the Amendment that the Board may include—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is already there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It can be done in the case of the directions, and yet it is written in that the directions shall be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would hope that the hon. Gentleman would realise that the debate we have had in this Committee has shown that this is an important point, and that Parliament would hope that such advice which is not of a confidential matter should be included in the Report. Although the Board is not prohibited from including this, something at this point in the Bill drawing attention to this fact would make sure it would include all formal advice which it had tendered to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not ask the hon. Gentleman to reply to this now because I feel that it is something which ought to be considered, and I hope that he will bear it in mind. In view of the arguments which he has put forward, particularly with regard to the confidential side of it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 41, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but in each case shall give a decision within six months of such submission".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this Amendment is to accelerate the process of development. It would seem often that when things go through the customary channels they depart, like Jonah, into the belly of the whale, and take some considerable time to emerge. I am not well educated in Latin but I believe that the customary description is taking it to avizandum: the delay can be extremely protracted. The Amendment is designed to ensure that decisions are taken quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best example of delay that I can think of in recent years concerning Highland development is the progress of hydroelectric development which has been going on and on. We have been waiting and waiting, and each time one asks questions of the Minister and inquiries whether we may have a decision, one is told that it is a complicated matter, that it is difficult, that more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
advice is needed, and that some committee must be set up to examine it. So many Members of the party now in Opposition were guilty of this during the latter years of office of the previous Government, and I am disappointed to see that hon. Members opposite appear to perpetuate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether there are prescribed priorities in the Civil Service for coming to decisions or that it would be against trade union rules to arrive at a decision more quickly, but I hope the Minister will look at this matter sympathetically and appreciate the need to come to a decision rapidly. I hope that he will consider whether some Amendment on the lines of this one might be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) clear up one important point? He says in the Amendment that a decision shall be given within six months. Suppose the Minister does not give his decision within six months. Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what he would propose to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should regard this as an obligation on the Minister. I think that is what it is intended to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to oppose the Amendment. In my view it is ridiculous to shackle the Secretary of State, either the present one or any future one, in this way. Pressure can be exerted from all directions, from the Board, or by Parliament, or by public opinion. Secondly, in my view it is bad legislation to put any details of this sort into an Act of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the desire of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) to get things done quickly and to have decisions made as rapidly as possible, but I am not sure that would be achieved by the acceptance of an Amendment of this character. Governments work in rather strange ways. If they are compelled to come to a decision quickly, they often take a wrong decision. Frequently, a better decision is arrived at if people are given time to consider, rather than asked to make a decision within a certain time. There is another point about this Amendment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
It is the fact that people may tend to regard the period of six months as the time for them to make a decision, and rather than get on with the job they may say, "We have six months; there is no need to hurry about this."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, a very easy way for the Secretary of State to get round this. He could say, "No," without prejudice to the resubmission of a scheme. Then the scheme which had been rejected would come up again during the next six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we should achieve anything by the acceptance of this Amendment, although its object is highly laudable. It is not usual to put this kind of thing in a Bill, because sometimes a big scheme may take a long time to consider. When something is being discussed which involves a large expenditure, or which interferes with the rights of a large number of people, it generally takes time, and various processes have to be gone through. That is one of the penalties which we pay for democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the Amendment. I do not think that in the long run its acceptance would make a great deal of difference, and the result of accepting it might prove disadvantageous rather than advantageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point which the Minister has made. I think it is sad that there should appear to be no means of accelerating the decisions of Ministers because, in effect, that is what the hon. Gentleman has said. I consider that six months is a long period. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) may not think it a long time or that this would be shackling the Secretary of State. I have been in Parliament for six months and it seems a dreadfully long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, it is quite clear that, although he was kind enough to say that the object of the Amendment is laudable, it will not be achieved, and clearly there is no other course for me than, with great regret, to beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 41, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) The proposals made under subsection (1) 	<i>(b)</i> of this section shall be published in the report made to the Secretary of State under subsection (1) 	<i>(e)</i> thereof and, in respect of each proposal which the Secretary of State has refused to approve there shall also be set out in the report the reasons for refusal.</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the objections voiced to the earlier Amendment will apply to this one. I do not think that the Minister has in mind to oppose it with the same arguments because what we suggest in this case is that actual proposals shall be published, with the reasons why the Secretary of State has refused to approve them. I think this to be a quite substantial and important Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any real case for concealing anything. There is no matter of secrecy or anything of a confidential nature about the proposals made by the Board in the ordinary way. There will have been consultations with local authorities and with the local consultative committee which, broadly, represents the area and the interests of the people in the areas and the region. There will also have been consultations, presumably, with other appropriate local bodies and, presumably, the statutory bodies. There will have been wide consultations again and comings and goings between the Board and the various Central Departments. It seems to me, after all that, that it would not be any breach of confidence or secrecy to publish any proposals which were made. These would be actual general and specific proposals as defined in the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, even the question of the six months delay in the last Amendment might well come into this. The Board may have proposed something specific or general which it thought should be urgently carried out in six months, but the Secretary of State might think that a period of more than six months was required and keep stalling it off—but that is all in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may have perfectly good reasons for refusing to allow certain proposals to be carried out, and in my view they ought to be published as they should in any case. It is right that the people not only in the Highlands but in the country as a whole who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
interested in these problems or have a responsibility should be taken into the confidence of the authorities. The Minister said a minute ago that the Secretary of State had a responsibility to the House of Commons regarding the relations between the Board and himself and the Board and the public. That is true, and the same statement of the Minister might well be transferred to the argument in support of this Amendment. The Minister also mentioned the Crofters Commission Report and commended the Commission for having referred to things it had suggested but which had not been done, or which it thought should be done. That also could be an argument in favour of this Amendment. I know that Sir Robert Urquhart, who was Chairman of the Commission, in its latter days, blew the gaff on a lot of the difficulties with certain bodies which the Commission had faced through the years. I am not sure who created the difficulties, but that is another matter which might be discussed at another time. The Commission referred fairly frequently in its Reports and comments to things which ought to be done and had not been done and sometimes even suggested the true reasons why they had not been done, and laid the blame at identifiable doors.

I do not think that it would be a bad thing to have this sort of frankness on the part of a body like the new Board, or that the people of the Highlands should be taken into its confidence. I think Parliament should be given the fullest account of the actual work of the Board and told freely about all the specific and general proposals it makes to the Secretary of State. We should like to know not only what has been approved by the Secretary of State—that would become obvious in any case—but also what has been rejected. It is important to know to what extent the Secretary of State is really supporting the Board, to what extent the Board has his confidence and he the confidence of the members of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the greatest possible sense of participation in the Board's work and progress should be enjoyed by the people of the Highlands and by Members of Parliament. That is what we are asking should be embodied in the Bill. I will not press the matter beyond these arguments. I think that the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
State will probably find the Amendment acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support this Amendment for the reasons given by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). I made an observation during the Second Reading debate in the same connection, and at one stage I had in mind an Amendment which I had proposed to put down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was considerable force in what the Minister has said in relation to my hon. Friend's Amendment to line 38—Amendment No. 83. The matters which concerned my right hon. Friend, the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) are fixed on the terms of this Amendment. When they spoke of former advice or formal advice—it arises by confusion of terminology in two different parts of the subsection—what I think they had in mind was that what could be regarded as formal advice is the kind of specific or general proposals referred to in this part of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was pointed out by the hon. Member for the Western Isles, once we get to the stage of formal proposals there is no question of confidentiality which can arise. It appears to me that this is the kind of thing about which Parliament ought to know and which ought to be published. In these circumstances I heartily endorse the Amendment, and I hope that the Committee will approve it and that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House of Commons and this Committee have consistently appealed to bodies outside, particularly to the trade unions, to get rid of restrictive practices. Yet it seems to me that in this Amendment as in the earlier Amendment we seek to impose what amounts to restrictive practices on the activities of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, the Board will consist of responsible men who know what they are about and what are the problems of the Highlands. Presumably, imaginative and constructive proposals will be put forward; and if, for good reasons or bad, the Secretary of State refuses his permission for the Board to proceed with any or all of these proposals the Board, if it felt sufficiently strongly about it, would
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
not be inhibited in any way under the present provisions in the Bill from publishing the reasons given by the Secretary of State for his refusal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board is and ought to be entirely free to use its own discretion about whether it will publish the reasons for the Secretary of State's rejection of a proposal. To put a statutory obligation on the Board would be a restrictive obligation which would lead to certain embarrassments, for the reasons given by the Minister of State when he resisted an earlier Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not trying to restrict the Board. I fully appreciate my hon. Friend's argument, but what we are trying to do is to put pressure on the Secretary of State to publish and disclose the proposals so that he must also disclose his reasons if he does not support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board will have this freedom. It will have complete freedom in its report to publish all or any of its proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or none. We have to put some trust in the Board and make it feel that we are doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly desirable for the Board to have stature and prestige, as we all hope it will, and for us to impose restrictions on it would tend to decrease its stature and prestige. I for one will certainly vote again the Amendment if it is pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the general tenor of the argument of the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). The Amendment is not in any sense restrictive. It certainly seeks to place an obligation on the Secretary of State, but when there is a situation in which the Board has made a formal proposal to the Secretary of State and it has been formally refused, I do not see why it is restrictive to say that we in Parliament and the people in the Highlands should know why the decision has been reached. We do not know why it was decided not to have a university at Inverness. We do not know the reasons for many of the decisions by the Board of Trade. For instance, we do not know why it has refused to back enterprises like a Cairngorms development board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
There are many things of which the public, and particularly Members of Parliament as representatives of the public, should have knowledge. The Amendment seeks to make public the reasons for opposing something, and its objective, to use a word employed by the Minister earlier, is wholly laudable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two essentials in the functioning of the Board and the relationship between it and the Secretary of State. First, we do not want the report to be an encyclopaedia. There is always a danger of that happening and it happens fairly regularly in connection with a Committee on which my hon. Friend the Member for West Fife (Mr. William Hamilton) and I serve, the Estimates Committee. When one gets on the Estimates Committee, one finds what restrictive practices mean, and I am sure that it is from his intimate knowledge of the Estimates Committee that my hon. Friend regards this Amendment as being restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Estimates Committee will also have the opportunity to look at the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that. That may endanger the Amendment, but your intervention, Mr. Steele, is helpful in driving home my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I thought that there were any danger of that in this connection, I should certainly support what my hon. Friend has said, but I do not see that happening. It is essential that we should have a report which will not be too big. We know what happens to such reports in the House of Commons. To use the Estimates Committee as an example, we issue large reports which are not read by, without exaggeration, 97 per cent. of hon. Members. That is proved when it comes to debating these reports on the Floor of the House, as I have seen repeatedly. Size is important, because size will affect price, and price will affect the number of people who will read the report. If the report is to be read, as we all hope it will be, it must bring home, particularly to the people of the Highlands, what is going on in the Board, and between the Board and the Secretary of State, so that people can read
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
for themselves exactly how things are progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the case, it is necessary for those who are to be affected by the functioning of the Board to know what sorts of proposals are being made to the Secretary of State; what is happening to them and what sorts of instructions and suggestions are coming from the Secretary of State to the Board. All these things are essential for co-operation and understanding between the people of the Highlands and the Board, and in the long run the Secretary of State. I believe that the Amendment will not make the report too voluminous so that people will simply turn away from it for lack of time, but that it will be sufficiently important to encourage people to buy it and read it to see what has been done in the year with which the report deals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Amendment is not accepted, will it be possible for the Board to put up a perfectly good scheme to the Secretary of State, for the Secretary of State to think it worth consideration, and to try to get funds from the Treasury to put it into effect, fail to do so, and so to have to go back to the Board to say that he could not agree to the scheme, the reason being that he could not get the funds? In those circumstances, would it be open to the Secretary of State to instruct the Board under Clause 2(1) not to publish the fact that it had made the proposal in the first place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of many reasons why the Secretary of State might think it desirable not to publish. There might be unfortunate reasons in that he would not wish to be branded as the person who had negatived a possibly attractive scheme, but there might be reasons which would be felt to be appropriate. It would be most undesirable if a perfectly good proposal put forward by the experts on the Board were to be blocked, and if the Secretary of State were to have the power to prevent publication and to prevent the public from knowing what scheme had been rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Directions given to the Board have to be published in the report. Clause 3(1,	<i>e)</i> says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"such report shall set out any directions given to the Board under section 2(1) of this Act".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
Therefore, if the direction from the Secretary of State was 	<i>intra vires,</i> which I believe is the legal phrase, if the Secretary of State gave a specific direction of that character—and I very much doubt whether he would, because directions have to be general in character—it would have to be published in the report. Therefore, it would be known from the report that the Secretary of State had given a specific direction that the facts concerning a specific scheme which had been put forward and turned down should not be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, the action of the Secretary of State in refusing the scheme could not be known till, possibly, 15 months later, when the whole matter might have died down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be known till the report was published, but that applies to all the Board's activities. None of them would be known till the report was published—apart from what appeared in the Press, or came out as a result of Questions in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general issue, we have to ask ourselves whether it is advisable to make it obligatory for the Secretary of State or the Board to publish the reasons for the Secretary of State's refusal of any scheme which he refuses to approve. Some of the arguments applying to earlier Amendments apply to this. I say this in spite of what was said by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). He could not see where the argument of confidentiality applied. The argument of confidentiality might well apply to some of the reasons compelling the Secretary of State to refuse a particular scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members might not achieve exactly what they want by the Amendment. In the course of time, the Secretary of State will no doubt evolve a suitable set of formulae for explaining why he has refused certain proposals. That usually happens in Government circles. I have no doubt that in time certain phrases and forms of words would be worked out to enable the Secretary of State to say why he had rejected something, but without telling us anything at all. That is not unknown among Ministers and civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
To accept the Amendment would be to make the report rather bulky. It might also lead to certain strained relations between the Board and the Secretary of State if they were to engage in public controversy, which this proposal might lead to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to prevent the Board from publishing its proposals and I would be prepared to accept the first part of the Amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposals made under subsection (1)	<i>(b)</i> of this section shall be published in the report made to the Secretary of State under subsection (1)	<i>(e)</i> thereof".</p></blockquote>
If there were certain proposals in which hon. Members were interested and which they wished to follow up, they could then do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I could not accept the part of the Amendment which places on the Board the obligation to publish the Secretary of State's refusal in every case. This would be quite unprecedented. It is not usually done. The Secretary of State makes a large number of decisions about a large number of things. He can be called upon to explain them in the House of Commons if it is felt that the powers he possesses have been abused or misused or are not understood. That is the way in which these things work at present. There is not a great deal wrong with this system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted the first half of the Amendment, we should enable this process to continue without placing the onus upon the Secretary of State not only to give his reasons in detail but also to publish them. That is as far as I would feel inclined to go with the Amendment. I would have to think very seriously before I accepted the second half, because it might lead to difficulties between the Board and Secretary of State and it might not achieve all of the things which my hon. Friend thinks it would achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to the Minister of State for at least showing some signs of movement, if not moving as far and as fast as many of us would like. His arguments on the Amendment have been particularly weak. The Amendment carefully does not state that the Secretary of State should give in great detail the reasons for a refusal. I do not believe that the question of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
confidentiality, of which the hon. Gentleman made a good deal, has any serious merit in the context of the Amendment. I recognised that it had a good deal of point on the Amendment in page 2, line 38, and that is why I did not press it. In this case, it would obviously be acceptable to the public, to Members of Parliament, and to others that it should be said that a certain proposal made by the Board was not accepted by the Secretary of State for certain reasons and that there were other reasons which, because of the confidentiality of the proposal, could not be given. Everybody would accept that. I feel that all Ministers use confidentiality as one of the most useful excuses for not telling Members of Parliament and others what is going on. I have seen this happening over the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State went on to say that this was quite unprecedented. I do not believe that it is. We had debates in this Room not many months ago on the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill. The Secretary of State had written into that Bill the provision that he should give his reasons to the teachers if he turned down any of their reasonable requests, on very similar lines to this. The Teaching Council was to be composed of responsible people who would make proposals to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State—the same man—wrote into that Bill the provision that he was prepared to publish in full his reasons for turning any of them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a similar situation. I was confident that the Minister of State would accept it. I do not want to delay the Committee. I am certain that the confidentiality point is not important and that this is not unprecedented. Those were the two arguments the hon. Gentleman adduced. They are both out of the window.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister of State has said that he is prepared to accept the first part of the Amendment; that is, he is prepared to accept that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposals made under subsection (1) 	<i>(b)</i> of this section shall be published in the report made to the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
We can take that for granted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant by that a list of proposals, because it must be remembered that some of the proposals from the Board might be very lengthy documents indeed. One would not wish to publish all the documents, which might run to 20 or 30 pages. One would publish in the report a list of the proposals and say, for example, "A scheme was proposed for the development of such and such an area". In other words, one would give a list of the proposals but not the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I would not like to see the report become an encyclopaedia, because then it would not be read. For my part, I should be prepared not to differ much from my hon. Friend on his definition of the word "proposals".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the Amendment reads thus:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, in respect of each proposal which the Secretary of State has refused to approve there shall also be set out in the report the reasons for refusal."</p></blockquote>
When the Secretary of State rejects a proposal, he must send a letter to the Board rejecting it. That letter must become the property of the Board and its contents the business of the Board and be related to the proposals which it has made to the Secretary of State. Are we to assume that, if that were not published by the Board, it would not be published by the Board because that communication from the Secretary of State was not the property of the Board but was a secret letter replying to proposals which are to be made public? If the proposals can get the light of publicity, why cannot the reply rejecting the proposals equally get the light of publicity? There is a dichotomy in the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The letter might simply not approve of the particular proposals. It might not include reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman feel satisfied with that? That is not the practice followed in planning legislation. When this statutory body puts up a considered proposal, does the hon. Gentleman think that it is good enough for the Secretary of State to reply saying merely, "I am not going to have it"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for that intervention because it supports the point I was making. This creates a very non-democratic relationship. Proposals can be made public and they will be the subject of discussion by the public and amongst those who are affected and who might have been affected had they seen the realm of reality. The reply to the proposals is to be secret and is to be withheld from them. I am not saying that reasons necessarily accompany the reply. One assumes that Ministers, with the powers which they have, can merely reject something without necessarily giving any reasons. I hope that they would give reasons. If the reasons are given, it seems a strange ending to the attempt to do something for the Highlands that the proposals should be ventilated and made known and come under public scrutiny but the reasons for rejecting the proposals should remain within the purview of the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the arguments adduced by the Minister of State are not logical. He said, first, that even if this were written into the Bill the Secretary of State would find a way round it. He seems to be saying that the Secretary of State is by definition a very slippery customer indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) point out that in regard to the decisions on planning legislation very detailed reasons are given for the rejection of decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have to be given by Statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. This is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If indeed the Secretary of State could find a form of words to escape, it is a good thing to press him a bit and to make him find this form of words and work for his living. But perhaps it is not fair to say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main arguments adduced by the Minister of State was that there was no need for the Amendment because the Board would have the right to publish these things anyway. If this is so, I do not see the point of accepting the first part of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
In contradiction of this point, the Minister of State went on to say that if such an obligation were laid upon the Secretary of State the report would be bulky and might contain matter which would stir up controversy. This indicates that the Minister of State is definitely of the opinion that there would be many things which will not appear in the report unless the Amendment is accepted. If they are by definition things which would stir up controversy I should have thought that the public ought to know them. However, that was the logic of the Minister of State's arguments. It was rather in contradiction to saying that if the Board wants to publish anything it can do so. I am not satisfied with the logic of the reasons given by the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to appear ungrateful to my hon. Friend the Minister of State. I am very grateful to him for offering us half a loaf. I was hoping that he would cast that half a loaf of bread upon the waters and come back even after many minutes with something more substantial. Perhaps he has now thought out some way of meeting this suggestion. If he has, he can interrupt me if he wishes. That would save some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that my hon. Friend is offering in fact practically the whole of the Amendment without quite going all the way. He has now agreed that the proposals should be published. He has not agreed formally, however, in terms of the acceptance of the Amendment that in the case of a refusal the reasons for the Secretary of State's refusal shall be published. Yet he said that the Board at its discretion may publish one or all of the Secretary of State's reasons for the rejection of its proposals. In fact there might well be published the totallity of proposals and also of the Secretary of State's reasons for rejection. But he has not accepted the Amendment as a whole. I think that this device of making it a duty now to publish proposals, but leaking the rejections is a rather ungainly way of achieving the purpose of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would, however, be the effect of the two parts of his statement. The acceptance of the first part of the Amendment would mean the publication of all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
the Board's proposals. The Board might then very well, as a body which is obviously going to get a great deal of freedom from the Secretary of State, publish all the reasons for his rejection of all the proposals which have been rejected. Adding these two together, would it not be far better to face up to the Amendment and accept it as a whole?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said that the Secretary of State must tell Parliament why he rejects the Board's proposals. That is another circumlocutory way of meeting the second part of the Amendment. If the Secretary of State is challenged on any specific or general proposal which he has rejected, he is, according to the Minister of State, under an obligation to tell Parliament about it. He would thus submit himself to an examination before Parliament about his reasons for rejection of each and every proposal, if hon. Members cared to raise it in the House. This is again a rather ungainly and roundabout way of achieving the purpose which can be achieved much more tidily by accepting the Amendment, without necessarily accepting the actual form of words, to which we are not tied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is about the most ingenious individual that I know in Parliament at framing Amendments. He has done it on many occasions in the past few years. I do not see why we cannot meet the purpose of the second part of the Amendment without having to go this roundabout way of bringing the Secretary of State under question repeatedly in Parliament, or leaving the Board to publish the reasons itself, while the Secretary of State is under no obligation to publish the reasons for the refusal of proposals which themselves are all listed and published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that, if the proposals are published in the half loaf acceptance of the Amendment but the reasons for their rejection are not to be published, this will create even more mystery and suspicion and could make confusion far worse confounded. Therefore, it is well worth while to be frank and to state these matters clearly and explicitly in the Board's report rather than to go through all clumsy parliamentary exercises of bringing pressure to bear on the Secretary of State and exposing each of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
reasons separately in debate rather than in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the argument about the bulkiness of the report amounts to a great deal. There might well be a large number of rejections; but I would think the larger the number of rejections of the Board's proposals the more urgent and important it is to know why the Board and the Secretary of State do not see eye to eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to be quite sure that the Minister does intend to do something about the second part of the Amendment. I am not asking him to accept the words I put down—they are very amateurish I agree, and the Amendment is by no means a perfect one—but I do not think there is anything to lose in having frank public relations between the Board and the Secretary of State and the public. There is surely a great deal to be gained every way if the reasons given by the Secretary of State for rejecting a proposal are good. It is important then that they be proclaimed. If, on the contrary, the reasons given are bad, I do not think the Secretary of State should be protected by concealing them. Obviously if something is wrong that ought to be exposed. Proclaim the good and expose the bad, is a very good case in itself. I ask the Minister to produce a little more yeast of ingenuity to add to the half-loaf he has offered us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he can find a better form of words, it would save us a lot of embarrassment in pressing the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first part of this Amendment is, to my mind, unnecessary, and if that is all the hon. Gentleman is accepting, in fact he is rejecting the Amendment. The first half of the Amendment relates to proposals made under paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> In paragraph 	<i>(e)</i> there is a statutory duty on the Board to make a report on the exercise and performance of the Boards' functions. One of the Board's functions is to make proposals, and the Board is statutorily bound, under paragraph 	<i>(e),</i> to report on the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only part of this Amendment which really matters is, the reasons for refusal. There is no obligation upon the Board and, indeed, I would go so far as to say it would not be competent, without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
wording of this kind, for the Board, to indicate the reasons given by the Secretary of State for refusal. It seems to me the last sentence of paragraph 	<i>(e)</i> rather underlines that. It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such Report shall set out any directions given to the Board"</p></blockquote>
by the Secretary of State. These directions come from the Secretary of State just as reasons for refusal come from the Secretary of State, and unless that provision is written into the Bill it would not be open to the Board to include in the report anything emanating from the Secretary of State—either directions or reasons given for refusal to accept a proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not here throughout the whole of the period during which the Minister was speaking, but it seems to me the confidentiality point is not good in this case, though it had weight in the first instance. I would submit that if this Amendment is to be accepted at all the whole Amendment has to be accepted, and I cannot find anything wrong with the wording.

However, I am prepared to look at this again with a view to trying to find words which will meet the demands made by the Committee and will meet what this Amendment sets out to do, to provide the lists of the proposals which are made and a list of the reasons why they have been rejected, if they are rejected, by the Secretary of State.

In this Amendment we have two objectives. First of all we are seeking information as to the intention of the Clause as it is now drafted, and, secondly, we make our own suggestion as to what we think the interpretation ought to be. The question which arose in our minds was a geographical one. It did not seem clear whether the acquisition of land was to be confined to the area designated as the Highlands and Islands under Clause 1 or whether this acquisition of land could take place in any part of Scotland. We presumed the acquisition of land could not take place anywhere in the United Kingdom because there is this specific reference to the 1947 Scottish Act about compulsory acquisition. We would be grateful for the Minister's interpretation of this Clause, as to whether action can be taken under the Clause in any part of the United Kingdom, secondly, whether, as at present drafted, action can be taken under this Clause in any part of Scotland; or whether, as we suggest is best, the action is limited to the area of the Highlands and Islands designated under Clause 1.

	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
In our Amendment we have made it clear that we think it should only be necessary for land to be acquired by the Board in the Highlands and Islands. We tried to think of possible occasions when it would be necessary to acquire land out-with the area and we could not think of reasons why it should be necessary or why any particular situation could not be met in some other way. If the Government interpretation of this Clause is that land can be acquired outside the designated area we should like to know the reasons why it might be necessary, and perhaps the Minister could give examples of the kinds of situations which he foresees in which the Board could usefully acquire land outwith the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless he can persuade us that this is necessary we suggest it should be made clear in the Bill that land to be acquired under this Clause should be within the area designated under Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that it does not apply to the United Kingdom. The Act is limited by Clause 18 (2) to Scotland, but the hon. Gentleman is correct in his interpretation of this Clause in saying it is not limited wholly and solely to the seven crofting counties. The reason is that we visualise it might be necessary in connection with works to be carried out on the borders of the seven crofting counties to do something over those borders for which it might be necessary to acquire the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has spoken several times in this debate about the Spey Valley drainage scheme. I do not know whether it would be so, but it is conceivable that it might be necessary to acquire land outside the Highland area in order to carry out that scheme properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has mentioned that scheme, which I referred to earlier, I would like to make it clear that what I was referring to then was need for consultation with the local authorities in counties outside the designated area, but if the hon. Gentleman is saying now that in carrying out such a scheme the Board or Secretary of State might acquire large areas of land outside the designated area this is an alarming prospect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to this particular scheme, which has been discussed over the past years, for the drainage of the Spey Valley. All I said was that supposing the Highland Development Board decided to proceed with such a scheme it might find it necessary to carry out works just outside the border of the Highland area, the seven crofting counties. It might also find it necessary to acquire land for that purpose by lease, by feu, or in some other manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question we are faced with as a Committee, and what the hon. Gentleman is faced with, is, is the Highland Development Board to have power to do that, or will it find it impossible to carry out the scheme because it cannot acquire a particular piece of land? We think the Highland Development Board ought, in a case like this, to be given powers to acquire that particular piece of land. It might, in connection with forestry and agricultural development, be necessary to acquire access to a main road. The access might come out of the seven crofting counties into one of the neighbouring counties. Is the Board to be given powers to do that or is it not? We think it should be given powers to do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the reason why the Clause is worded as it is, and this is the kind of thing we have in mind. We do not propose—it certainly is not in our minds—that the Board should acquire land down in Galloway, or Berwick, or East Lothian or in Edinburgh, Princes Street, or any where like that. We have nothing like that in our minds at the moment, but we are concerned that in works which—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman says "at the moment" does he mean that later he might?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One never knows what one might be thinking in ten years' time, of course. If one is progressively minded and is prepared to adapt and change one's thoughts to the changing moods of people, one might find that people are quite willing to accept ideas in the future which they do not accept now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, at the moment, as I have said, our ideas in connection with the Board are that we would like it to have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
the powers to obtain land by lease, by feu, by excambion—I must use that word—or by compulsory acquisition just outside the area of the seven crofting counties in order to enable the Board to carry out schemes approved by the Secretary of State and, where it is found necessary, to acquire the land neighbouring that particular scheme in order to carry it out successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can fully understand the need to have powers to operate just outwith the designated area. I think that is understandable to all Members of the Committee. However, if that is what is wanted, then the Government have gone a very long way to get it. The Clause is giving power to the Executive, to the Board or to the Secretary of State to acquire land compulsorily anywhere in Scotland. It is restricted to Scotland because the acquisition of land is covered by the Scottish Acquisition of Land Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the Minister said, that the Bill only applies to Scotland: the Board does not have power to acquire land by agreement outwith Scotland. Now, is that right? I would beg leave to doubt that. Here we are setting up a statutory body with, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, certain wide powers. They can acquire land in a whole variety of ways—by exchange, among others. They can also, under Clause 6, carry on any business or undertaking. Would it not be competent for this Highland Development Board in this instance to set up a tourist advisory body, for example, in London as long as it was related to the functions of the Board, namely, the economic and social development of the Highlands?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to know whether it is intended that that should be done. The Minister has already given us a pretty clear indication that it is not intended to go as far as that. However, what I am asking is whether this Clause gives powers to this Board to do that very thing. In my submission, on first reading, it certainly does. There is nothing to prevent this Board from acquiring by agreement land outwith Scotland for certain business functions, provided those business functions are related to the social and economic development of the Highland area. If it is not the intention of
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
the Government to acquire such a wide field of freedom of action, then it seems to me that logically the wide terms of this Clause ought to be restricted. If the Minister is only concerned about exercising those powers by agreement in the areas adjoining the Highland area, why not say so? Why involve the whole of Scotland and, in one view, at least, the whole of the United Kingdom, in the scope of those powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just trying to find the correct answer to the question put by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I am advised that it is very doubtful whether, in fact, the Board would have those powers under the Bill as it stands at the present time, but I will find out rather more definitely and let the hon. and learned Gentleman know. However, that is my advice at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And let the Committee know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will let the Committee know, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands at the present time it is rather doubtful as to whether the Board would have the very wide powers suggested by the hon. and learned Gentleman to establish a tourist advisory bureau in London. It could, as I understand it, probably employ the services of the Scottish Tourist Board to do that, but the Board itself would not have the powers to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with this Amendment, the purpose of it, as I have said, is to enable the Board to acquire land on the borders, or neighbouring land, for the purposes of works within the seven Highland counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised, too—and I should have said this when I spoke before—that this Amendment is incorrectly worded. By using the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"within the area designated under section 1 (2) of this Act"</p></blockquote>
the reference is, in fact, to the areas which might be designated by order under that subsection, these are the designated areas under that subsection 1 (2). The areas designated are areas designated under order; in other words, they are areas additional to the seven Highland counties. For that reason it would not be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
However, for the reason I have given, which is the important one—namely, that we think the Board should have the power to be able to obtain that small piece of land which might be necessary for the successful carrying out of works within the area—the Board itself should have the powers to acquire that land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State, and, as usual, the examples he gave the Committee of the way his mind is working were very trivial ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Spey Valley?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that in every case of which he gave us an example—the Forestry Commission, the forest spreading over the border, the need for access down to a main road, drainage further down the Spey to help, if such a thing is conceivable, the problem from the top—in all these things the Secretary of State has in his own hands ample powers. I am not in the least convinced that the hon. Gentleman is right. I apologise to him if the brevity of my hon. Friend's speech made it difficult for him to get the answers he wanted from his colleagues. This is a very good fault: I shall try to maintain it!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I think is perfectly clear that whatever the words of Clause 1(2) they are intended to mean—and I believe they do mean—the Highland counties plus any areas designated under that subsection. That was certainly intended, and that is the area in which these powers should be given. I can foresee very considerable heart-burnings and troubles in the Highlands if the Board, for what may seem to it to be good reasons, should decide that the factories to process timber, fish, and the many other things which the Highlands produce, should all be set up outside the Highland area. There may be good economic reasons for doing this but there may be very bad social reasons for doing this. However, if we give the Secretary of State, to whom in fact these powers are given, this authority to take over land and build factories</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>For that reason I think we should press this Amendment. I believe that it is right. I believe it is what the High land people would want.

As I said at the beginning of my speech, this Amendment is at least intended to cover—and I believe it does—both the crofter counties and the areas which the Secretary of State in his wisdom may decide should be added to that area by designation. Therefore, there is no conflict in this at all. I do feel, however, that this is important because the developments which one hopes will come from an intelligent Secretary of State one day, and an intelligent Board, should be carried out within the Highland area and not scattered around Scotland, because, perhaps for some purely economic reason, the advice may be that there are better places to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 3, to leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
I shall try to deal with this, and with Amendment No. 23 very quickly, partly because I think that the Minister of State will want to accept at least one if not both of these Amendments, and partly because I think that this is a small though important aspect of the problem which we have discussed in different forms in our earlier debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first Amendment relates to subsection (1, 	<i>(a)</i>) which states that the Board may
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State, by agreement acquire land, whether by way of purchase, feu, lease or"—</p></blockquote>
to use the Minister's favourite word "excambion".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me patently and obviously absurd to set up a Board and to say that it is a responsible body and then—when it has obtained the agreement of the people concerned to buy a piece of land and when everything is perfectly straightforward and simple—to say that the Board should have to come back to the Secretary of State. There would be no question of argument, or of priorities or anything of that sort, but the Board would have to come back to the Secretary of State for approval. I think this is ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that there may be some confidential reason, or that the Treasury may have an interest in the amount of money paid. But the Board is, surely, to be backed, if one believes the Minister of State—though he has said, on many occasions, "If the Board is composed of intelligent men", as though he has doubts that it will be. However, I am clear in my mind that the approval of the Secretary of State is quite unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment relates to a different point. I think, however, that it would be for the convenience of the Committtee to discuss the two Amendments together even though it may prove neces-
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
sary to vote upon them separately, if the Minister is obtuse. Here the problem is slightly different. The Board may manage land acquired under the provisions of the subsection and with the approval of the Secretary of State, and subject to the provisions of the Clause,
	<br><blockquote><p>"dispose of or otherwise deal with such land".</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to refer to some of the later Amendments to the Clause, but here the Clause says that the Board can hold and manage land but has to have the approval of the Secretary of State if it wishes to sell or to dispose of the land in some other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I have lived in the Highlands I have seen that endless trouble and bother has been caused to the activities of various bodies—the Forestry Commission, The Crofters Commission, and others—which had acquired land and could have made arrangements with neighbouring people to sell one piece of land and buy another for the benefit of the area. But Parliament or some other body, or, it may be, the Secretary of State, interfered, and said, "No, we do not want this to happen."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this Board should be able to come to a sensible agreement about acquiring land and should not need to obtain the approval of the Secretary of State. If it decides that some land it has acquired for some purpose is no longer useful for that purpose or that it might be improved in the hands of someone else—which is a possibility—the Board should be able to pass on the land, for a suitable price, to the other body. If mistakes are made, that will come out in the report to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) may perhaps accuse the Board of not acquiring sufficient land or of not keeping control in its own hands, or of making profits by the useful management of the land. The hon. Member may want the Board to keep everything under its control. Other hon. Members may criticise the Board for not going far enough in a way which they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
would like and more in conjunction with free enterprise in the country as a whole. Whichever way it may be, the Board should have a discretion to do these things by agreement, and not be tied to the apron strings of the Secretary of State by every possible means and in every possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly recommend that both references to the Secretary of State could be deleted without any damage to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has made a sound case for the first Amendment. Where the Board has been able to secure land by agreement it should be unnecessary for it to have to go to the Secretary of State for his approval. I support the Amendment, which, I think, has already been fully argued by the right hon. Member for Argyll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment is different. Where there is land which could be secured by agreement, that is fair enough, but under paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> land may be acquired compulsorily. In order to do that, as I am sure the right hon. Member for Argyll would agree, we have to secure the permission of the Secretary of State. This is something which might cause a considerable amount of disputation and argument. If it has been necessary to secure the approval of the Secretary of State compulsorily to acquire land it would also be desirable that the Secretary of State should have some idea as to how the land should be disposed of. The Board might make mistakes. It might well be composed of brilliant and clever people, as has been hoped, but it could possibly make mistakes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the argument which the hon. Member is advancing in respect of the second Amendment equally applicable to the first, that the Board could make mistakes and therefore the Secretary of State should be required to approve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is necessarily so. Where there is an agreement made without argument or discussion it would be an unnecessary extra to bring in the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, if there is a question of financial arrangements the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
State would already have some control. As has been pointed out in the debate the Board has not a wide range of financial freedom. To give a ridiculous example, let us assume that the Countess of Sutherland, in her wisdom, decided to hand over all her land to the Board, at a certain price. Suppose this was arranged by agreement. Obviously, the Secretary of State would have to find the money, and if the arrangement went through, he would have a degree of control. If, as may usually be the case, a small piece of land were acquired by agreement, I do not see the necessity for the Board to have to go back to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the second Amendment we are dealing with land which has been purchased compulsorily. Obviously, therefore, there has been some controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not wish to follow that line of argument because had I done so we should have been anticipating other Amendments. For that reason I did not fully deploy the argument about the disposal of land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I feel that I have made the point I wish to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to the first Amendment, it is generally thought that the acquisition of land will arise from proposals approved by the Secretary of State, and when he approves them, he will approve the acquisition of the land, and it will not be a case of running backwards and forwards. It could happen that the acquisition of land might form part of a proposal not approved by the Secretary of State. If the Amendment were accepted it would be possible for the Board to go ahead with the acquisition. A substantial amount of land might be acquired and in such a case one would think that the approval of the Secretary of State should be obtained. If it were a case of acquiring smaller portions of land for specific purposes—perhaps an acre or two here or there—the matter could be dealt with under Clause 14(1) in the way of general provisions, providing for the Board to acquire land of that nature for a specific purpose without coming to the Secretary of State at all. But for the reasons I have given, about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
the possible substantial nature of acquisitions which might form part of a scheme we think that the acquisitions ought to be approved by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point in respect of the second Amendment is precisely that indicated by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). Here we are dealing with land compulsorily acquired. There are certain procedures in respect of such land when it has to be disposed of. It must be offered to the previous owner, or at least the person from whom it was acquired must be consulted about whether he wishes to have an opportunity to get it back. This is an important consideration. There is also the question that once again a substantial area of land might be disposed of and one must consider the implications of the public interest and the best use of the land, how to dispose of it and to whom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons we think that the Secretary of State should be asked to approve the disposal of land by the Board, and I cannot accept either Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the argument particularly in connection with the disposal of land acquired by compulsory purchase, which falls into a special
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
category. Under Clause 2(1) the Minister already has power to give general directions to which the Board must give effect. It is within the power of the Secretary of State to give general directions regarding the disposal of land subject to a compulsory purchase order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not wish to anticipate later Amendments there is a further Amendment to, as it were, tie that up, to deal with the case of a specific piece of ground, which might not be covered under the general powers of Clause 2(1), by providing a discretion in relation to a particular piece of ground notwithstanding that it is of a specific character and would fall within the ambit of those general powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of both Amendments is to loosen the bonds which tie the Board. We fully accept that there is to be some reserve control over the disposal of land in the ordinary case, particularly with small acquisitions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
