Clause 9.—(ANCILLARY POWERS OF THE BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Further Amendment proposed [11th May],</i> In page 6, line 7, leave out subsection (2) and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) For the purpose of the exercise of any of their functions the Board may, with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, borrow money".—[<i>Mr. Willis.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday morning I was speaking about the Amendments to the Amendment. They would spell out in greater detail the regulations governing the powers to borrow money which it is already accepted the Board ought to have. I will not pursue the matter very much. I will try to sum up my arguments as briefly as I can.<br><br>
First of all, the Government already accept that the Board should, subject of course to Secretary of State and Treasury approval, be empowered to borrow money. Secondly, they not only accept it but they accept it to the extent that the Minister himself is prepared to move an Amendment which clarifies this and which alters the negative emphasis which was present in the original wording of the Bill. Consequently we are in a situation where we have a compromise agreed by all parts of the Committee that the Board should be empowered to borrow money, and further that this power should be made clear and that there should be no doubt about it. I quote from what the Minister said yesterday morning. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My Amendment is designed to tidy up the Bill and make clearer what is said by subsection (2). The power to borrow money is implicit in the provisions of subsection (1,<i>d,</i>), but we thought that we would spell it out more clearly, which is what we intend by the proposed new subsection."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 11th May, 1965; c. 657.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 668</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the hon. Gentleman? Could we have some air in this Room. It is so stuffy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Member has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I wait for the air, Mr. Steele?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this position I really cannot see why the Minister should be unwilling to accept the Amendment to the Amendment and explained by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). I do not wish to reiterate the arguments adduced by the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I think he himself summed them up very well in one sentence yesterday. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although the Minister's Amendment would alter the emphasis in the right direction, I submit that it would be desirable to have a detailed provision making perfectly clear that it is envisaged without doubt that not only will the Board have borrowing powers, but it will be able to exercise them."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 11th May, 1965; c. 660.]</p></blockquote>
Quite clearly, if there is going to be a provision for the Board to be able to borrow money, why put it in at all if it is not visualised that the Board should be able to use it, except in very restricted circumstances such as the Minister himself mentioned? I think the examples adduced by the hon. and learned Gentleman from other comparable legislation, which contains detailed provisions of this kind, the Colonial Development Act and the Industrial Training Act, were particularly apposite, and I would have thought, in view of the precedents, and the apparent importance of precedents in the framing of legislation, that they should in consequence have carried some weight with the Parliamentary draftsmen. I think it is a very simple argument. The Minister has already accepted the need to have powers of borrowing, and it seems to me that he detracts in no way from his position by accepting the Amendment to the Amendment, and I would urge him to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said—[<i>Interruption.</i>]—I wanted to make sure that the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State was able to give his attention to our discussion.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0696">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Someone was asking about the bells and whether they were for a Division. It is not a Division. They signify that Prayers are over.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the kind of provisions which my hon. and learned Friend explained in the Amendments to the Amendment are inappropriate and unnecessary, and here we must disagree with him. He says that there is an obligation on the Secretary of State to provide money to the Board when it has been set up, and he prefers what he calls the grant in aid system. This again, I think, brings out the difference between the two sides of the Committee, because we have complained, upon other parts of the Bill, that the Board appears to be upon the end of the Secretary of State's apron strings, and here he intends to put the Board on the end of the Secretary of State's purse strings as well.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has mentioned that, where a major project is in prospect, borrowing as here described would enable a great deal of time to be saved and avoid the necessity for a special Bill in Parliament, and would therefore be of great assistance in going ahead with that major project. Of course, we have had the pulp mill as an example in the recent past. But also, it would give the Board the opportunity of dealing with a large number of minor projects, because if it were able to get general approval under subsection (3) of the Amendment to the proposed Amendment and could borrow money, it could then get on with the job of pump-priming for a number of small projects of a kind which, again, my right hon. Friend has described, many of which might only employ 15 or 20 men. That is the kind of project which is required in a great many cases in the Highlands.<br><br>
There was another point which the Minister made which I would like to take up with him. He said that there would not be—?</span></p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for Divisions in the House.</i></p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had just started to raise the point that at the end of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
last Sitting the Minister of State said that the Board would not be a body which would make profits. This was one of the arguments he used against the Amendments which we are proposing to the Amendment. I should like to check this point with him. When we were dealing with Clause 6 I asked him whether if the Board took over a firm it would make profits and whether the profits would accrue to the Board, and I do not think he answered that point. He has an opportunity to say more about it now. We have made it perfectly clear that we oppose Clause 6, but if Clause 6 stands in the Bill in its present form the Board could perfectly well take over enterprises, run them and make profits. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that, because the gist of his statement at the end of the last meeting was that the Board was not the kind of body that would go in for profit making in business.<br><br>
While I was speaking the Minister of State, from a sedentary position, interjected that the Amendments which we are proposing to the Amendment also had the effect of placing the Board at the end of the Secretary of State's purse-strings. Therefore, I wish to make clear how our proposals would improve the situation. At present, when the Secretary of State has given approval for an individual project, the Board expects the money to be made available by the Secretary of State. The Minister of State said that it was implicit that if the Secretary of State approved a project he would make the money available.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State in fact gives approval for a general category of operations, what then will happen? Will he make so much money available as a grant in aid to cover a number of projects for the future, projects which at that moment have not been put before him, and do not need to be put before him because a general category has been approved? If not, if there is any doubt about it, we think that our Amendments to the Amendment would improve the position. They would mean that the Board could borrow money so as to be able to go ahead with the kind of project to which the Secretary of State had given general approval, without having to to go to the Secretary of State on each occasion for the money.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
Furthermore, our proposed subsection (5) contains a guarantee which would make the power of borrowing more real and effective. While the Minister's Amendment improves the position as originally contained in the Bill by making a positive statement that the Board will be able to borrow, none the less it does not give the guarantee which will put such borrowing beyond doubt and which will make it certain that the Board will have no difficulty in borrowing. We consider that our proposals would greatly assist the future Board, and we hope that the Minister will give further thought to accepting what we propose, or something very like it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have, of course, already given a great deal of thought to this, and, as I said last week, as a result of that consideration we came to the conclusion that the Board ought to be financed by grants in aid rather than by borrowing. I have not heard any arguments to convince me that we are wrong. I interjected when the hon. Gentleman was speaking because he said that the Opposition had objections to the Board's being tied to the apron strings of the Secretary of State and that now we were tying the Board to the purse strings of the Secretary of State. This is precisely what this Amendment to the Amendment does, too. The proposed subsection (3) makes the borrowing exercisable only with the approval of the Secretary of State and of the Treasury as to the amount of borrowing which may be effected. This might be applicable to particular borrowing, and that the Secretary of State can also lay down conditions. I should have thought that my interjection was relevant to the point.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman argued that this borrowing might be necessary in order to carry out the pump-priming operations which the Board might have to undertake in connection with the certain industries which it wished to see started in the Highlands. We agree with that, but consider that it should be done in the way laid down in the Bill, that is to say by grants and loans provided by the Board under the provisions of the Bill and not by borrowing. Certainly the Board will have the full power to do this, and we hope that in the category approvals which might be given under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
Clause 14(1) it will be possible to do this within the arrangements which might be made by the Board the Secretary of State and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear that this Amendment does not exclude grants from the Secretary of State and relies wholly on borrowing. It is not suggested that the Board should carry out these projects only on borrowed money. This is an additional power which might or might not be used, according to the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman put this forward as one of the arguments why we had to accept the borrowing powers. I am pointing out that it is possible to do this without these powers. If the Treasury approves arrangements under which the Board is enabled to do this, the Treasury has clearly got to find the money for it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about profits. Of course an industry can be profitable; on the other hand it might not be profitable at that point of time when the Board is called on to operate it. It does not mean to say that it would not become profitable, and the profits would accrue to the Board.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the activities of larger scale enterprises. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Board undertaking this work. This argument was advanced during a previous sitting by one or two Members, among them the hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) and the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). I am informed that the statutory powers of the Board under Clause 8 are wide enough to enable them to provide financial assistance for large as well as small projects. If a very large project were involved, for example, a project of the magnitude and complexity of the Corpach Mill development, one might expect that special provision would be made. A large project might of course come within the terms of the Local Employment Act. It might well happen that the criteria imposed under that Act would not be fulfilled and there could be associated problems involved in the provision of certain facilities. The situation might then point to special legislative provision
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 673</span>
giving Parliament the opportunity of considering policy issues involved in expenditures of this magnitude. Some of the examples quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) are expenditures on a large scale indeed and would raise certain important issues of policy for the Government.<br><br>
Apart from these considerations, and subject to the character of the particular development, the Highland Development Board would not be precluded through lack of statutory power from providing financial assistance. In that event the necessary money would be available under Clause 16. We are here dealing with the exception rather than with the general run of the work of the Board. Clause 8 is designed to meet the general expenditure in connection with the running of the Board. In view of the fact that a great number of these expenditures are of a character not necessarily related to the running of a business in the ordinary sense of the word but related to the social development and that kind of thing, we believe that the right way to meet such expenditure is by grants in aid. We visualise that the Board ought to be financed in this way. I am afraid that I must ask the Committee to reject the Amendment to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the Minister is perfectly right that if the Secretary of State approves a proposal, then there is implied in that approval that the necessary funds are going to be made available. However, that begs a big question. To look at it the other way round, the Minister of State was saying that the Minister would not approve any proposal without assurance that funds are going to be readily available. If the borrowing power is there, it would be possible for the Treasury, while unable or willing to make an advance to cover the expenditure, to guarantee the exercise of borrowing powers. That would mean that the Board would be able to raise the necessary funds with Treasury guarantees and it would enable the Board to get on with its work.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
It is not intended to supplant Treasury grants by borrowing sources. The whole purpose of this Amendment is to supple-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
ment the calls which the Board can make on the Treasury for grants, by giving it power to raise money from other sources, subject always to agreement and approval by the Treasury. I would have thought that since that agreement is built into the provision, no harm could be done in this matter. I must confess that I am sorry the Minister has not agreed even to have another look at it, although I appreciate that this line has no doubt been fully considered to date.<br><br>
I should just like to acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan). I think he was quite right. The Amendment would be improved if the words in the Minister's Amendment
<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury"</p></blockquote>
were deleted, because in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of the Amendment to the Amendment there is repeated the need for that consent. It would improve the wording of the Amendment if the point made by the hon. Gentleman were taken up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say in reply that the hon. and learned Gentleman talks about something which the Secretary of State might not approve but which ought to go ahead nevertheless. I believe this is the point he made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not approved, because there were no ready funds to meet it. I am visualising the situation where the Secretary of State would like to have it done, but because he cannot get Treasury consent for the funds he has to refuse consent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand this Clause, if that were the case, and if there were an exceptional case in which large expenditures were involved—and quite clearly these would be fairly large expenditures—and because of this it were thought to be important that this should proceed and that loans ought to be made, these is nothing in this Bill to prevent that from being done. However, it would be quite wrong to say that this would be the generally accepted financial position. It would not. What we visualise quite clearly in this Bill, and what will be the practice, is that the Board should be financed by grants in aid. As I understand it, however, there is nothing to prevent this exceptional circumstance

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
Clause 10—(POWERS OF ENTRY.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span> I beg to move, in page 6, line 28, to leave out "which is occupied".<br><br>
This subsection provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person authorised under this section to enter upon any land, shall, if so required, produce evidence of his authority before so entering, and shall not demand admission as of right to any land which is occupied unless twenty-four hours notice, or in the case of land occupied for residential purposes seven days notice of the intended entry has been given to the occupier."</p></blockquote>
I just wonder if these words are really necessary, because is it conceivable that any land which the Government has in mind will not be occupied?<br><br>
This is partly a probing Amendment. On the face of it, it seems to me that it is not necessary to have these words there. If significance is to be attached to the word "occupied", then it seems to me that it would be undesirable to have the words there, because where the land is not occupied it would be possible to demand admission as a right. I do not believe this is a desirable state of affairs. This Amendment is largely of a probing nature. I shall be interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, this is a legal point, and the hon. and learned Gentleman might be able to follow this</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
<p><i>Amendment proposed to the proposed Amendment,</i> after "may" insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the subsequent provisions of this section."—[<i>Mr. Wylie.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That these words be there inserted:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 13.</p>
<p>much better than I. However, he happens to be wrong all the same. I am informed that the effect of this Amendment would be to deprive the Board of the ability to obtain statutory right of entry to unoccupied land, since the Clause as amended would require it to have given notice to an occupier who was not there, the land not being occupied. This point, as a matter of fact, was raised with the Secretary of State by the Scottish landowners, and they said roughly what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said: that where land is not let, then the legal occupier is the owner. However, the reply to that is that in this Clause the word "occupied" must be read in its ordinary meaning, and without the qualifying words "which is occupied" in this subsection, it would not be possible for the Board to obtain a legal right of entry to land which was, in fact, unoccupied. That is the short answer to the question.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I trust that the hon. and learned Gentleman, with this very short explanation, will withdraw the Amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that if land is not the subject of a lease then the occupier is the owner. However, I would have thought that the point made by the Minister would be covered if a subsequent Amendment about inserting "owner" as well as "occupier" were included. There are later Amendments, after the provision about notice in writing of the intended entry has been given to the owner and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 677</span>
the occupier. I would have thought that that provision certainly covered the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it the hon. and learned Member's desire to take, with this Amendment, Amendment No. 111, in page 6, line 30, at end insert "owner and the"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think, Mr. Steele, that that would be quite a convenient way to approach this.<br><br>
Right of entry to land is a very serious encroachment on individual rights, property rights. Whatever may be said about property rights, one has to know where one stands in these matters. Whilst accepting the need for this kind of a power in a Bill of this nature—and it is to be found in numerous other statutory provisions—it is desirable that things should be tied up as carefully as possible.<br><br>
On the owner and occupier point, I would have thought that where land was occupied by a tenant, it was not only the tenant who had an interest in the land but also the owner. He likewise ought to be informed of what is going on. If one brackets these two together, and if intimation has to be made not only to the occupier, if any, but also to the owner, then it seems to me that the words "which is occupied" become completely unnecessary. Surely it is inconceivable that in this country of ours there is any land which is neither owned nor occupied. In my submission, these two Amendments together would clarify the position. I would suggest that the Minister at least considers the matter before taking a decided view on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. In view of the fact that the method of approaching the landlord is being argued now, I think it might be worth considering how the method of writing and the time allowed and the procedure to be evolved by which the landlord is approached.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to say to the Committee that when calling the first Amendment I omitted to indicate the grouping which I think would be of convenience to the Committee. I would suggest to the Committee that along with the next Amendment, No. 124, we should take Amendments No. 108, in page 6,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
line 28, leave out "twenty-four" and insert "forty-eight"; No. 109, in line 28, at end insert "in writing"; No. 110, in line 30, after "notice", insert "in writing"; and the Government's new Clause (Service of notices):
<ol>
<li>Any notice for the purposes of this Act shall be in writing, and any notice required or authorised by this Act to be given to or served on any person shall be duly given or served if it is delivered to him or left at his proper address or sent to him by post by means of the recorded delivery service.</li>
<li>Any such notice required or authorised to be given or served on a body corporate shall be duly given or served if it is given to or served on the secretary or clerk of the body.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this section and of section 26 of the Interpretation Act 1889 in its application to this section, the proper address of any person to or on whom any such notice as aforesaid is to be given or served shall in the case of the secretary or clerk of a body corporate, be that of the registered or principal office of the body, and in any other case be the last-known address of the person to be served.</li>
</ol></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the point which the hon. Gentleman has made. However, at the moment I am not concerned with how the intimation is made to the owner or the occupier; that is another point. The point I was trying to make is that intimation should be made, both to the owner and occupier, where both these categories of person arise in any particular case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman, perhaps, in practice might be much more concerned about how he approaches the Highland landlord if he realised the difficulty of tracing him. That was the point of my suggested grouping of Amendments—about "in writing". Nearly always there is a considerable delay in the matter of making contact with the landlords. It is, indeed, difficult at times to get over this problem at all.<br><br>
I am talking now about actual experience with people in my own constituency. A few years ago, in the Island of Lewis, which is not a large part of the Highlands, it was extremely difficult to find out who the proprietor was in one small estate and to discover even who was acting on his behalf. By the time we had discovered who was acting for him, we realised that he was not a locally-based landlord. This meant entering into correspondence which in turn took a considerable amount of time.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0701">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 679</span>
However, I do assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that the method of approach to the landlord very often will have to be in writing and it can be a very circuitous business. In many cases, it is very difficult to trace and identify the actual landlords. I should like to mention a single experience. When the Highland Advisory Panel put forward, with the help of the Scottish Departments, the Strathoykell scheme for the integration of forestry and agriculture in a certain area formed from parts of the estates of a number of landlords, the biggest delaying actor at the beginning of the first few months was making contact with the landlords.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If I remember correctly, an immense collection of foreign postage stamps accumulated in St. Andrews House before all the landlords had been contacted. It is extremely important to consider that point in relation to the notices of intention to enter lands and the time limits of 48 hours and the 24 hours, and even the seven days. I can assure hon. Gentlemen opposite that it also sometimes takes seven weeks and has even taken as much as seven months after contact to get the agreement of landlords to co-operate in projects.</span></p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have a quorum. Do hon. Members wish to continue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. MacMillan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had finished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that when the hon. and learned Gentleman was speaking he talked of the occupier, if any, and the owner, so he is himself suggesting that there might not be an occupier, which was precisely the point of the first Amendment. But I do not wish to make much of that.<br><br>
This second Amendment raises rather a different point. If we accepted the second Amendment we would have to give notice to both occupier and owner. The provision in subsection (2) requiring notice
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 680</span>
of entry to be given only to the occupier is very well precedented and is to be found, for instance, in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act. The purpose of this notice is really to safeguard the person in actual occupation against unreasonable inconvenience resulting from entry for which he might not be prepared, or for which he might wish to be in attendance either personally or through a representative. In other words, it provides a means of minimising the inconvenience caused by entry. In this circumstance the owner, unless he happens also to be in actual occupation, in which case he will be the occupier within the meaning of this subsection, does not suffer personal inconvenience and therefore does not require the safeguard provided for the person in occupation.<br><br>
If we accepted this Amendment it would involve the Board in a very great deal of extra work. It would have to give written notice to both owner and occupier. That minor difficulty apart, experience in the Highlands has shown that it is extremely difficult at times to trace owners of land in the Highlands and Islands and this obligation to try to find the owner would, of course, cause the Board a great deal of delay and frustration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without anticipating a future Amendment, would not that point be cleared by an indication that Amendment No. 114 would be accepted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will see when we come to that; it is to the following Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we should leave that for now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think so. The arguments about Amendment No. 114 are rather different from the arguments about this present Amendment. We feel that if we accepted this second Amendment the Board's operations could be severely handicapped. A comprehensive and extensive scheme of agricultural and afforestation development could be delayed or frustrated if the Board were unable to enter and survey what might quite well be a small piece of land which was nevertheless essential for some particular purpose, such as drainage, because the ownership of the land was not known or was in dispute.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0702">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 681</span>
So I am afraid we really cannot accept either of these Amendments. I think the hon. and learned Gentleman saw the force of the argument in connection with the first, so I hope he will see his way clear to withdraw it and not pursue the second.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point about trouble and inconvenience, but power is being sought to obtain information from occupiers—there has to be an occupier, otherwise there would be no point in this—and I find it difficult to think that a tenant would not know who his landlord was. There might be some difficulty, of course, in tracing the owner in that way, but I would have thought it perfectly practicable.<br><br>
I must say that in principle I am against this idea of public authorities being able to walk on to people's property without the owner having been informed. That is more than inconveniencing the tenant: it impinges on the rights of the owner. I know this provision is well pre-cedented, but it does not follow that the point should not be taken, and I would prefer this Amendment to be negatived rather than withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already indicated that with Amendment No. 124 it would be convenient, I think, for the Committee to take Amendment No. 108, No. 109, and No. 110, and the new Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 124, in page 6, line 28, to leave out from "unless" to "has" in line 30, and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"seven days notice in writing".</p></blockquote>
As the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said a moment ago, we are dealing here with some very important provisions which envisage quite a considerable degree of interference with the independence and rights of individuals. In those circumstances I think one ought to make as reasonable provision as possible to ensure that those rights are not unjustly overruled.<br><br>
Let us look for a second at the sort of things which can happen if the Clause as it stands is allowed to become statute. We are told in subsection (2), with which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 682</span>
we are at present concerned, that authorisation of entry on to land may be obtained after 24 hours' notice is given. This will be changed slightly by the new Clause which the Minister is to move, and which will ensure that the notice will be in writing. So it would appear that one can get a letter one Tuesday morning which will tell one that boring will start on one's land the next morning. According to subsection (4),
<br><blockquote><p>"Any power conferred by this section to survey land shall be construed as including power to search and bore …"</p></blockquote>
and so on.<br><br>
I do not see in what circumstances such short notice will be necessary for the satisfactory work of the Board. I do not think that seven days is a particularly long time.<br><br>
As to the arguments which have been put forward by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) regarding the difficulty of pinpointing the actual owner of the land, it would appear that by his new Clause the Minister is accepting that warning should be given in writing. Therefore I do not think this point any longer stands as an important part of the argument. Equally, I would say that although it might be true that in Strathcona there was a delaying factor for many months, I think the Minister, by his new Clause, is accepting that notice must be given in writing and has, indeed, accepted that this will remove the difficulty in that direction. Therefore it seems to me that seven days' notice in writing is reasonable, since there is a readiness to accept a quite considerable intrusion into private liberty.<br><br>
Personally, I really do not see any reason for the distinction which is made between the 24 hours' notice for land which is occupied and the seven days' notice for land which is occupied for residential purposes. I cannot see that this distinction is necessary. If the reason for having this in the Bill is to enable action to be taken swiftly, then I would think that swift action is just as likely to be needed on land occupied for residential purposes as on land which is merely occupied. Unless this has a legal connotation of which I am not aware I really cannot see that this distinction is necessary.<br><br>
It seems to me, therefore, that Amendment No. 108 does not make a great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 683</span>
deal of difference; there is not a great deal of difference between one day and two days. I think that if the Minister has already accepted that for land occupied for residential purposes seven days' notice ought to be given and has further accepted that notice ought to be given in writing, it would be reasonable, logical, and quite fair that seven days' notice in writing should be required for all land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say right away that there is nothing which the hon. Gentleman has said with which I disagree for one second; I agree with him entirely, and I am quite sure that hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee will indeed be pleased that, after the statement on Second Reading that the Liberal Party welcomed the Bill and accepted the powers, the hon. Gentleman is now realising that perhaps some of those powers do need investigation and trimming just a little.<br><br>
I am quite certain that the Highland Development Board, in tackling the task which faces it, will want to carry folk with them, and will want their good will, and with those folk I include of course, landowners.<br><br>
I must say that I do not see, either, the great significance of the difference between 24 hours for land which is occupied and seven days for land which is occupied for residential purposes. I think that 24 hours' notice for land that is occupied is too short, and I therefore go along with the hon. Gentleman in suggesting that it should be seven days all round. After all, it is not a bit unusual for people who live in the slightly remoter areas to be covered by the Board to be away from home for two or three days. Therefore it would seem to me, and I am sure that hon. Gentlemen will agree, that it would cause great annoyance, which the Board would not wish to stir up, if people—officers of the Board or others—could go walking into fields or on to land completely uninvited, unannounced and unasked.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I looked at a discussion we had some years ago on the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Bill, Clause 8 of which gave right of entry on producing an authenticated document. Admission there was not to be demanded as a right unless 14 days'
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 684</span>
notice of the intended entry was given to the occupier. In addition, there was on that occasion a safety valve, if I may so describe it, of an application to the Sheriff in case of urgency. On that occasion the Minister of State and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) took part in the discussion, and the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State made some remarks in the course of which, if I may say so, he did not come down firmly on one side or the other, but he did comment on the inconvenience which was caused by officials entering premises, and I was interested to hear him use that word "inconvenience" this morning. The Minister of State, on that former occasion said—it really is a delightful quotation—
<br><blockquote><p>"All sorts of officials come down to my house, and they come in at once. I ask them for their authority, and then they crawl all around the house and no one objects. Sometimes it is a little inconvenient—for instance, if I am preparing lunch."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15th December, 1960; c. 171.]</p></blockquote>
I must say I found it a most attractive proposition to conjecture as to how many officials all come at once. There they are, crawling round the house, with the Minister of State tossing crumbs of wisdom—or something else—off the electric or gas cooker as he is preparing lunch.<br><br>
What is the great urgency here for the 24 hours? In that debate the hon. Gentleman the Member for Central Ayrshire and the right hon. Gentleman the member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) made a valid point, that when up against flood prevention it might be necessary to go in at short notice, because something disastrous might have happened when one was away; but I cannot see that, if it is to bore, or to prospect, or to see if the land is suitable for development, that seven days is not a perfectly reasonable period of time. I believe that by giving that notice we would carry the owners and occupiers with us, whereas 24 hours' notice, I am perfectly certain, will merely put their backs up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that we must be careful not to cause local opposition by writing into this Bill a legal obligation which might conflict with local usage in these vast, unfenced areas in the Highlands, where people do wander on land and are not breaking any law of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 685</span>
Scotland, so far as I understand it. We ought not to impede any freedoms such as we already have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, and I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be able to give us the benefit of his legal authorities on that particular matter, but on one thing I am certain, and that is, if this period of 24 hours is maintained it will provoke what I suggest will be a quite unnecessary amount of hostility.<br><br>
Having said that may I just direct attention to two points in the new Clause which the Minister of State has put down? Although I would not pretend to have one gramme of legal training in me it does seem to me that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"if it is delivered to him or left at his proper address"</p></blockquote>
are open to question, as to what is the proper address. It is not impossible that the person in question may live away from the premises and may not receive the notification. This seems to be a loose piece of drafting.<br><br>
Even more so if something is to be "left". Surely to goodness this could mean that it could be put on the stone outside the front door—only to be blown away in a high wind, which we do get occasionally in the Highlands. I think this word could mean that the authorities would say "Well, we left the notice at the house, and the fact that it has completely disappeared into the Minch is really no fault of ours.<br><br>
Therefore I would expect the hon. Gentleman, with his great insistence on legal purisms, to tighten that wording up a little. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, after the most beneficent mood he was in yesterday, when he accepted an Amendment, will have got into the swing and the momentum, and will be keeping it up, and will decide to accept these Amendments, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just thinking about this in relation to the realities of life in the area concerned. Life there does not always fall into distinct acceptable periods of 24 hours. Of my own constituency it used to be alleged that very few people in past years carried watches, and that not too much regard was paid even to the calendar. Twenty-four hours does not mean quite so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 686</span>
much in the seasonal rhythms of the crofting and fishing way of life, for, often, crofters are also fishermen and they frequently go away fishing for a period of days or weeks. This argument was raised in one of the Crofters Bills and I think in fact serious consideration was given to it and some alteration was made in the Bill accordingly. It is quite a serious point. The fishermen have to go away across the Minch or lobster grounds in the north-west and sometimes they stay away for a fairly long period, possibly only leaving behind them very old people or a person who may not fully apreciate the meaning of an official notice or wish to deal with it personally. This sometimes causes a certain amount of unnecessary dispute with officials and their offices.<br><br>
In my view, however, the case which has been made so far by hon. Gentlemen opposite is more a case for an Ombudsman than for an Amendment to this Bill, because as the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said, there is so much precedent that one cannot easily argue against it on grounds of creating new powers.<br><br>
Another traditional reason for the absence of crofters from their homes is the old itinerary of the regular seasonal sacraments of the Churches, when the crofters and their wives and other people very often go away to a different parish and stay there with friends or with fellow members of the same Church for some days at a time. Quite a few of these traditional customs and observances fit into the pattern of an old established way of life, and I think that as far as possible we have to take these things into consideration. It is worth while making a gesture of conformity to local ways in a situation like this.<br><br>
Finally, although the crofter has to live within 10 miles of his croft he is not necessarily resident in his own house or upon the croft. He is thus not always available by just going at short notice to the croft. I am not going to suggest what the period of time within which to notify him of entry on the land should be; but I do suggest to the Minister that he should allow for the fact that the watch or the clock is not quite so vital or regarded with the same respect and deference in a place where one works with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 687</span>
seasons and the rhythm of nature as it is in urban and industrial circumstances where people accept limitations upon their freedom imposed by themselves. Therefore I would suggest to my hon. Friend that at least extension of 24 hours and even the longer period should perhaps receive further consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may reply to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) first, in relation to the crofter who lives 10 miles away from the croft, the notice is served at his last known address, and quite clearly his last known address would not be the croft 10 miles away but it would be where he was living.<br><br>
I understand the point made by my hon. Friend about crofters going away and people going to live in other parishes. This applies to everyone. People go away for a month's holiday, and quite clearly, when they leave their home address for any length of time it is customary for them to make some arrangements about their mail in order that they may receive it, or for somebody to deal with it. This is not peculiar to crofters, and it applies to almost every Act we have passed where we make provision for the delivery of notices.<br><br>
This set of Amendments really deals with two issues. One is the length of time for the notice and the second is whether or not it should be in writing. By my new Clause it will be seen that I have accepted that the notice should be in writing. This simply leaves the question of the length of time for which the notice should be given.<br><br>
I must say I am really highly flattered at the assiduity with which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has been following my speeches. It is rather a mammoth task that he has undertaken—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But very rewarding!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it is most rewarding. I have noticed a marked improvement in the speeches of the hon. Gentleman since he undertook this task. I hope he acquires the same facility for drawing word pictures as the quotation indicates. It was a very delightful picture, if I may say so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
But the hon. Gentleman was really on a false point here, of course, because he talked about entering premises under that Bill and entering residential dwellings under this Bill, and, of course, the time allowed under subsection (2) is seven days, so it is not just a question of going along at short notice.<br><br>
I understand, in connection with this Clause, that land used for residential purposes refers to land which is used by a person as his residence, namely, the house and the garden, and that sort of thing. That is the general meaning of the words "used for residential purposes".<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
We are mainly concerned with other land. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West will be delighted to know that once again, as throughout the whole of the Bill, I am in a very magnanimous mood and I intend to accept the Opposition's Amendment to increase the period from 24 to 48 hours.<br><br>
The provision of 24 hours is well pre-cedented. It is precendented in the Crofters (Scotland) Act, 1955—passed by hon. Gentlemen opposite; the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1947—one of ours; the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947; the Local Employment Act, 1960, and the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act, 1956—passed by hon. Gentlemen opposite. So that both parties have generally accepted this in the past; but we see that there is some force, because of the distances involved, in the argument that 24 hours might be rather too short, and we are prepared to accept that Amendment.<br><br>
With regard to the longer period, we must have in mind what is happening here. We expect there to be general agreement and good will between the Board and the occupier, and the landowner, too, if it is the landowner that we are dealing with. Entry will generally be after discussion. The Board will approach the person concerned and say to him, "We would like to enter on your land and make a survey. We would like to do whatever there is to be done." The man might say that it is not convenient for him, and he might ask the Board to do it the following week. If the Board were not in a great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 689</span>
hurry it would say, "Yes", but if a recalcitrant owner or occupier were to refuse he would know quite well that he would get a notice served on him. The notice would not come out of the blue through the post one morning. He would know days beforehand that he was going to get the notice. This is what has been ignored during this discussion. The general assumption, especially by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), has been that this notice was going to come out of the blue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Ball about prior discussions before a notice is served. The Secretary of State is complying with the principles of the Bill if he does send a notice out of the blue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have provided for the appointment of a Board which we think will consist of intelligent men, and we hope that they will act intelligently as a result. I cannot see the Board going around the Highlands deliberately putting up everybody's back and expecting to be able to do a job of work. That does not make sense to me, and people do not usually behave in that way. If the Board intends to make a success of what it is doing, one would expect it to establish good relationships with the people with whom it is dealing.<br><br>
It seems to me that it would go to a person and say, "We would like to do this. Would it be all right for our people to come in to survey particular areas of your land?" The person concerned would then say either that they could come in, or that it was not convenient and that they should come back the following day, which would probably be agreeable to the Board. If, however, the person did not agree at all, then quite clearly the intention of the Bill is to give the Board powers to get on with its job. It must have powers to get on to the land and it will serve the notice for that purpose.<br><br>
The point I am making here is that, in our view, this notice will not suddenly come out of the blue. The owner or occupier will know that in due course—it might be very quickly or it might be after a rather longer period—he will be getting a notice that the Board
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 690</span>
intends to enter. Although the time specified in the notice might be 48 hours, which is what I am now proposing to accept, he will have known for longer that the Board proposes to come in. Therefore, it is not so sudden as was suggested. For these reasons—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the arguments of my hon. Friend, but if there is an estate owner who is usually resident in, say, London, and who comes up for a month once a year and has a resident factor on his estate, would the purpose of the Bill be served if the notice was served on the factor in residence on the estate, or would the notice have to be served on the owner resident in London?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a legal expert, as Members of this Committee have learned in the past, but I assume that powers would be given to the factor to deal with matters of this kind. If the factor did not possess those powers, one assumes that—probably when he was first consulted and before he received a notice—he would say to the Board, "I do not have powers to deal with this, but I shall refer to So-and-So as quickly as possible." That seems to me to be the way that business is done.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Gentlemen will not press these Amendments. We have given way on the fact that the notice should be in writing, and we have accepted an extension of the time from 24 to 48 hours. In other words, we have indicated our desire to meet the legitimate points which have been made, whilst at the same time not derogating from the power of the Board too greatly. For these reasons, I hope that the Amendment to which we have agreed will be accepted, and that those which we have said we cannot accept will be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not awfully impressed by the logic of the Minister's argument. He certainly appears to be endeavouring to prove that 24 hours is reasonable notice, because he says that the Board will be reasonable people and there will have been prior consultation. If this argument is well founded and good, why bother to extend the period to 48 hours? Why make any concession at all if, according to his own arguments, there is no need for a concession of that kind? It would seem

to me that the whole burden of his argument was to prove that 24 hours is a reasonable period of notice, and he spent no time in arguing that it would be in any way hampering to the Board's activities if seven days' notice were given, if for one reason or another the Board were being a little unreasonable.<br><br>
It is not only to landlords that this provision would apply, by any means. I get people coming to me and complaining about the Forestry Commission unexpectedly making surveys on their land. This sort of thing can apply</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment made:</i> In page 6, line 28, leave out "twenty-four" and insert "forty-eight".—[<i>Mr. Noble.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a question which I should like to put to the Minister arising from subsection (5), which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person entering upon any land by virtue of this section may take with him such other persons as may be necessary …"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Steele. Am I to understand that you are not taking Amendment No. 112?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After the graphic word picture from those days of 1960 when the Minister described premises crawling with officials, I would ask him whether he could tell us his ideas on who these other persons might be who are described as "such other persons as may be necessary". Can he give us some examples of the kind of invasion that might or might not occur, because other persons were being brought on to the premises?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider that this is an important Clause which one ought to be careful in applying. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
equally to crofters and to smallholders, and it does not seem to me that a reasonable provision of seven days—and we cannot always assume that everyone of us is going to be reasonable—is something which can properly be objected to on any material grounds. I cannot really see that it would be right for me to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the words proposed to be left out, to "twenty-flour" in line 28, stand part of the Clause:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 10.</p>
<p>some remarks about the attitude of the Liberal Party to the deployment of such powers and was kind enough to quote my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie). I very briefly quote back at him—because this is quite relevant to the Clause—what my hon. Friend said about the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) because it applies to him. I quote from HANSARD of 16th March:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman is wrong. I did not say that I accepted the powers in their entirety. I specified the powers of compulsory purchase which I said were entirely necessary. I doubt whether the Board needs all the powers of asking for information and so on …".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th March, 1965; Vol. 708, c. 1190.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p>We must be careful to safeguard the rights of the individual. Where damage is caused, it should be quite clearly stated in subsection (3) that compensation will in fact cover it. I believe that this is something about which the Committee argues at length from time to time, but I do not propose to enter into this matter. It may be that it is reasonable as stated, but I hope that it is in fact definite. I hope that there will not be any doubt that, if damage is proved and accepted, compensation should be made. I think the powers here are necessary, and one hopes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0708">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 693</span>
that a reasonable Board, which is intent upon securing the co-operation of the people in the area, will use them wisely.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member referred to what my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) had said, but I think my hon. Friend was referring to the statement right at the beginning of the speech by the representative of the Liberal Party in the Second Reading debate and who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We welcome the Bill, accept the powers and wish the Measure extremely well."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th March, 1965; Vol. 708, c. 1137.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly reply to that? That was at the beginning of the speech, as the hon. Member well knows, and my hon. Friend was making a general acceptance, which he qualified later on by a particular reference which I quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I ask the Minister if he would make clear the reason for one word in subsection (5)? It refers to other persons and officials leaving "any unoccupied premises". Why the emphasis on "unoccupied"? I should have thought it possible that in these days, especially in regard to agricultural premises, when labour is becoming more and more scarce, that the occupier may be absent when these people appear. Surely it should be the responsibility of these people to secure the gates or the barn doors, even in premises which are technically occupied? Would the Minister object to saying at a later stage that the word "unoccupied" could come out? I think that in certain circumstances there should be a liability put upon those who go into premises to make sure that the gates are secure. I ask him to look at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To answer the first point raised by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell), the person authorised to enter on the land may take with him other persons as necessary. Should the premises be unoccupied I gather than he must leave them as effectively secure against unauthorised entry as he found them. A person entering ought to be able to take technical officers with him. He might have to take the driver of a jeep with him or something of that kind. He might also have to take persons
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
with him in connection with searching or boring for minerals. They may be people whom he has to get from outside and provision has to be made for this. These are the kinds of persons whom we envisage will be entering. It should be noted that the person entering on the land should have with him only such other persons "as may be necessary" for his purposes.<br><br>
The fear has been expressed by Scottish landowners that the subsection could enable the Board to send in a little army of investigators. That is just not the correct picture, for they must be persons necessary for the Board's purposes at that time. The Board must act reasonably and within the limit necessary for its purposes. It will exercise the powers of entry in the knowledge that in the event of a dispute it will have to justify the reasonableness of the action taken.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) raised the question of compensation under subsection (3). He had an Amendment down to change the word "may" to "shall". I would assure him that his Amendment would have made no difference and had it been called I would have accepted it, because in point of fact it makes no difference legally.<br><br>
I am sorry if that is not quite in order, Mr. Steele, but I am skimming off to the point raised by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart). I cannot give him the answer straight off on the point about unoccupied premises but will look at it in the light of what is said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one small question I should like to ask. Are these people who enter on land invitees, licensees or what are they? Should an accident occur, what is their position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite follow the question. If the hon. Gentleman will elaborate and tell us what he means by this, I will try to answer him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I wish to know is, supposing one of these people goes on the land and suffers an accident of some sort—perhaps because of a trap, or something of that sort, on the land, is he in the category of an invitee or licensee? What is the position?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 695</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman having elaborated, I am still none the wiser. However, I will look at the point he has raised. I will consult with my advisers and try to give him an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could assist the hon. Gentleman. The categories to which my hon. Friend referred have all been abolished by the Occupiers Liability (Scotland) Act, 1961.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. That saves me chasing the matter up.</span></p>

Clause 11.(POWER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be convenient if, along with</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment No. 114, we also considered Amendment No. 62, in page 7, line 28, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) The Board shall have full power to identify the owner or owners of any land in the Highlands and Islands.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Then we could take together Amendments No. 121, in page 7, line 28, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Such an owner occupier or person who considers that the information specified in a notice served under subsection (1) of this section cannot be justified as being reasonably required by the Board in the exercise of its functions, may appeal within one month of the service of such notice to the sheriff of the county within which is situated his land business or undertaking: and the sheriff shall give judgment on such appeal within two months of the receipt thereof.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 122, in line 30, leave out "the foregoing subsection" and insert "subsection (1) of this section".<br><br>
No. 123, in line 31, after "or", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"not being a person having lodged an appeal under subsection (2) of this section".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>We can take No. 63 separately: in page 7, line 38, leave out "£50" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>" £100, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months, or to both</p></blockquote>".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 114, in page 7, line 20, after "Board", to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall prepare a list of all lands over 500 acres in extent owned in the Highlands and Islands and of the names of the owners of such lands, showing the rateable value and the acreage owned in each case, and further".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>
This Clause says that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board may by notice served on the owner or occupier of any land in the Highlands and Islands or on any person carrying on a business or undertaking therein require him to furnish them with such information as may be specified in the notice with regard to the land …".</p></blockquote>
The onus is placed on the occupier or the owner, but we know as a fact that it is very difficult, and almost impossible, in many cases to find out who the owner of land in the Highlands may be at the present time. We felt it essential that after the word "Board" the words in our Amendment should be inserted.<br><br>
If one is to give effect to this Clause, the first thing to do is to find out who the owner of the land concerned may be. It is not fair to place on the occupier the onus of finding out who the owner is. He may require to get from the owner information which he himself does not have. That is a problem which Parliament is placing on him and which ought to be shouldered by Parliament itself. It is our business to find out who are the owners. Some, of course, have gone; the land they owned at one time has now been broken up or the ownership has been diversified, and so on. But those factors do not relieve Parliament of its duty in the matter.<br><br>
This matter has interested me for a number of years, and I have sought in the House to find out from time to time the identity of these shy gentlemen. I have been thwarted on every single occasion. On one occasion I managed to get down a Question asking that a return should be prepared. The Chancellor of the Exchequer at that time, in July, 1963, informed me that the task was of a magnitude which could not today be undertaken by the Treasury. That was an alarming attitude, for I had dug out in my researches in the Library a return prepared in 1874. I will not mention the Government in power at the time.<br><br>
It was prepared in that year by a Treasury staff which must have been less than the numbers now employed in the Treasury. They could not then have possessed the techniques of administration which are used today; and they certainly had never heard of computers. Therefore, that sort of answer which was given to me was, to my mind, simply a matter of the individual in power refusing to face up to the issue involved.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 697</span>
That return went much further than the Amendment. It gave a record of the names and addresses of every owner of one acre and upwards in extent outside the municipal boundaries of burghs containing more than 20,000 inhabitants, with the estimated acreage and annual value of the lands and heritages of individual owners. It also showed the number of owners of less than one acre with the estimated aggregate acreage and annual value of lands and heritages of such owners in each county.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Members of both sides of the Committee will see that the task was an immense one. It tells us that James Alexander living in Queen Street, Helensburgh, had a property estimated to be one acre in extent and that his gross annual valuation was £100. As a contrast, the Duke of Sutherland living in Dunrobin Castle, Golspie, had an estimated acreage or 1,176,343 acres and a gross annual valuation of £56,395 13s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are just examples, Mr. Steele.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without involving the Chair, I am sure that all of us would be interested to see this vast compilation. It is here to be studied by any Member on either side who wishes to look at it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would be very glad if we could study it. I have been searching for it for months in the Library. I now discover the reason why I could not obtain it! In fact, I managed to get the House of Lords copy. The hon. Member will find in that copy that the Duchess of Sutherland then owned 149,879 acres in Ross-shire, so the Sutherland were not doing too badly at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend. I apologise if I caused him any inconvenience in his researches. However, I realised that if I once let it out of my grip I might not get it again, so I put it in another library, of which no one except myself knows. I put it in my locker. I thought it was safer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
there! However, those concerned knew where it was.<br><br>
This return even covers less than half an acre. All we are asking is that those in possession of 500 acres and upwards should be registered. This will give us a vast amount of information which is pertinent to the problems confronting us today.<br><br>
The two examples I have managed to give show that there has been a maldistribution of ownership in the land of this country. This maldistribution, which has provided some people with an acre and others with over a million acres, has led largely to the depopulation in the north which is one of our worries and with which the Bill before us seeks to deal. Other problems, such as mal-use of the Highland territories, have been created as a result of the maldistribution.<br><br>
A great Liberal Leader, John Bright, whom the hon. Gentleman I am sure holds in high esteem, as do most of us in the Committee, visited the Highlands of Scotland at the height of his career. He wrote a fascinating account of his travels in the Highlands. He also tried his hands at a little poetry. When he was in Glen Urquhart, visiting that beautiful area surrounding the village of Druimnadrochit, he wrote a little poem about that part of Loch Ness side. I remember two lines of it:
<br><blockquote><p>"Glen Urquhart is to me a lovelier Glen.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There deer and grouse have not supplanted men."</p></blockquote>
What was true when Bright visited Loch Ness side is true today, because the problem of deer and grouse is still one which is causing the Highlands of Scot land not to be cultivated as they should. There are people who tell us—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must bear in mind that this is not a matter which arises on this Amendment, because here we are dealing only with the question of a list of names.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Mr. Steele, I know that the Amendment may lend itself to the tight control of the Chair, but it can also obtain from the Chair a kindly hand instead of an iron grip.<br><br>
Many of us feel that the problem of miscultivation or malcultivation lies in the fact that we do not know the names of these individuals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 699</span>
who are holding up development in the Highlands, as they are doing today. We ought, perhaps, to be able to distinguish definitely some of the problems which are causing the depopulation which we want to stop. I thought it would be pertinent to show, first, that there is tremendous waste in the Highlands at the present moment.<br><br>
In my view, that waste can be attributed to the fact that we do not know the people with whom we will have to deal according to this Clause in the Bill; we should know them. We must know these people if we are to stop the waste which exists at present in the use of Highland territory. Part of the waste is shown by the fact that farms in the Highlands today are getting bigger and bigger. When a farm passes a certain size—and I make these points very quickly indeed—production falls, costs rise and subsidies increase, resulting once again in the creation of greater expenditure for the nation as a whole.<br><br>
The particular use of the land for grazing deer by the tenants or these unknown persons is defended on the grounds that it is now only of use for that particular purpose. However, nowadays I do not think anyone really accepts that, because I am sure that every farmer-in the Committee would accept the view that if land can graze deer then it can also graze sheep. As a result of this type of ownership or lack of ownership we are not only breeding deer in the Highlands—when in many cases, we could do without them—but we are encouraging the hobby farmer. I mention that only in passing, We are driving people out of the Highlands because the increase in hobby farming is making it more difficult for the young, active farmer who wants to work in the Highlands, to get a farm. This is due to the fact that when farms come on the market, these people put up the price against the younger element, who are prepared to work the farm as a farm, with the result that these young farmers have no alternative but to leave the Highlands for other parts of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he has ever tried hobby farming in the Highlands, because I think that if he had he really would not be taking the line he is. By the restriction brought in under the last
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 700</span>
Government, hobby farming in the main has disappeared, but it never was really on in the Highlands. If it ever was, it certainly is not now. It is not possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Quite clearly, this discussion is now getting very far beyond the Amendment. The Amendment is, whether a list of all lands over 500 acres in extent should be prepared. I do hope the Committee will help the Chair in keeping to this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am perfectly prepared to co-operate, Mr. Steele, and was doing my best to do so, until I was lured away by the intervention of the hon. Member for Bute (Sir F. Maclean).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was lured away by the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the apologies of both hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will realise, Mr. Steele, that I cannot enter into too many arguments at the same time. However, I have here in front of me a letter from a gentleman farming in the Highlands, whom I have quoted before. He tells me that hobby farming—the breeding of fancy cattle and pedigree herds—is on the increase, and is on the increase because they can hide living costs, they can get cars, staff, and so on, which they place against Income Tax as farm expenses and use their land against the payment of death duties. If that is not destroying the rights and chances of the people who are living on the land in the Highlands, then I should be glad to know what is. I will leave that, Mr. Steele. I do not want to contest the issue too long with the Chair because I know that you are doing your very best to be helpful.<br><br>
The real purpose of the Amendment is to try to get the Committee to face a problem with which we are concerned and which today is driving people from the Highlands because they cannot get land. I take it that the hon. Member was referring to the 1957 Act. However, the 1957 Act prevented the son from falling heir to the tenancy of the land his father was farming; it deprived him of that right. That is my recollection of the Act. The hon. Gentleman was saying that he can succeed to the tenancy, but he has been deprived of this right</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 701</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I was saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I claim that the process of depopulation, by the methods I have just indicated, which is going on in the Highlands, is a matter which must engage the attention of the Committee. It is for that reason that I am putting forward this Amendment, which, I hope, my hon. Friend will see fit to accept in due course.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) also has an Amendment but he had to leave the Committee temporarily just now and I want meanwhile to say a few words in support of the Amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend who has moved it.<br><br>
I think both sides of the Committee will recognise that it is impossible to escape from contact with the landlord in connection with the work of the Highland and Islands Development Board. Therefore, the landlord assumes an importance here which, of course, he has in reality in the area, quite apart from his place in the Bill. But with the Bill he now becomes a person of even greater importance in the context of all Highland development which is likely to take place or to be attempted under the new Bill and the new Board. So many of the Board's functions will require consultation with and the co-operation of the landlords and there will have to be so many references to the landlords in the course of the Board's normal work in the Highlands and Islands that it is extremely important that the landlords should be known. I think there should be no dispute about that anywhere in this Committee.<br><br>
Therefore, for the convenience of the Board in carrying out its functions and for the convenience of everybody concerned, including the owners, it is better that all the landlords should be known in advance rather than that they should have to be approached one by one as problems arise and all the necessary research be undertaken in the midst of the job of dealing with every individual case where such facts are required. I do not imagine there will be any vital objection of principle in any of the parties to this information being obtained and being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 702</span>
systematically recorded. I do not think there have been any objections from the landlords themselves so far to this Amendment; we have had no communications about it and I do not think there is anything on public record against something of this kind being done. Indeed, to some extent these estates are listed now in the many local valuation rolls; although it is not done systematically in the form of a register for the whole region, which would be far more convenient for reference for everybody concerned and especially for the Highlands and Islands Development Board. In the valuation rolls in each of the separate counties and burghs, information of a kind, on the subjects locally is available; but there has always been difficulty in getting information of a wider character, including acreages, in particular.<br><br>
To a large extent the task suggested in our Amendment is a matter of collation of information which is already known in this inadequate form and scattered way. In the 'seventies of the last century it was not regarded as too onerous a task to prepare a register of estates, with acreages and some description of their current use. Moreover, under the Crofters Acts, a croft register now exists, so that any crofter who has to be approached is already registered. The acreage of each croft is known, the tenant is known, and generally speaking the proprietor is consequentially known as well. So there is no breach of any principle or precedent or any lack of precedent in our request. There is a clear precedent for it in part in the valuation rolls of the counties and burghs. Secondly, the crofts themselves are already registered, and indirectly the proprietors are registered too because the crofts are registered. Finally, there was the 1874 register of estates, now badly out of date.<br><br>
So if objections of principle were not raised by the landlords in the 'seventies of the last century why should the landlords of today object to the register being brought up to date after this long lapse of years? I am sure they will recognise the fact that with the coming of the Highlands and Islands Development Board it is more important and worth while to have a register of this kind in 1965 than it was in the 'seventies of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 703</span>
last century. I cannot feel there will be any serious objection to this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following the hon. Gentleman's argument, I wonder if I might ask why he has confined his Amendment to a list to cover only estates over 500 acres. Why has he not gone beyond that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are several answers and, admittedly, several doubts on that point still remaining; but I will give only two. One is that a request was made to the Government at different times over the past several years for a register of all lands and it was rejected out of hand. As to acreage, this 500-acre figure is essentially a compromise, I quite agree, but I am glad to have been asked by a Liberal why we do not go the whole hog, since they usually ask us in this party why we are going too far and not compromising.<br><br>
The other point is that for a start we should be happy if we could have a list even of lands over 500 acres. Additionally, so many crofters are in fact the owner-occupiers now that it would not be a difficult task to extend the list well below that 500-acre minimum acreage. Many crofters have taken occupation since it became possible to enjoy the normal croft tenants' grants and other assistance, formerly only for tenants, in recent times. So it should be fairly easy in practice to extend the information and record to cover the lower acreages because the croft register exists and the owner-crofters are known.<br><br>
However, the main point is that we have not got an up-to-date register of land ownership. As I have said we shall be involving landlords at many stages of the Highlands and Islands Development Board's work and the Board will have to go to them. First of all, therefore, the Board must be able to identify them and know with whom they are dealing; and it is better to have all this knowledge available in a systematic record in advance than to start hunting out identity of each landlord, and the other facts about each area of land on every separate occasion when this need arises. And since we have had no objections at all to this record, being made from any landlords' organizations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 704</span>
of any kind outside or from any individual landlord I cannot imagine that the more progressive landlords to whom we are accustomed to address ourselves on the other side of this Committee will have any objection either. And since there was a register in the 70's of the last century I cannot imagine any landowner opposite wanting to be thought more secretive or reactionary in these respects than those landlords of the last century.<br><br>
I, therefore, think that the arguments are very strong that such a register would not only assist and serve the administrative convenience and tidyness of the Board's work but would also be of use to the landlords themselves. Some time earlier this morning we were talking about entry by the Board's officials upon lands and talking about 24 hours' notice and seven days' notice to occupiers or owners. I am sure that hon. Member's opposite, including any landowners among them, would want to save the landlords and the Board's time by having this information we are asking for made up and ready for the convenience of the landlords and the Boards. If a landlord has to be consulted and to be informed quickly about some scheme, involving his estate or himself, it is much better that he should be easily known and identified and that general information and statistics about his lands kept in an up-to-date record so that he need not be bothered and questioned about this by the Board. This register would have permanent value and would probably be kept up-to-date in the same way as the croft register from year to year, or at intervals of three years or five years. In any event, it would be a tremendous convenience to the Board itself and would cause no inconvenience to the landlords. I do not think anyone would ask for such confidential information as whether the landlord pays his income tax or super tax—or, how much. The necessary information on rating and valuation is already in the valuation rolls and I do not think anyone would object to such a useful document as this register of lands which is all we are suggesting.<br><br>
That is all I want to say and I hope my argument has been reasonable as well as comprehensive. I would appeal to all hon. Gentlemen to assist by supporting the idea of such a useful public record which could inconvenience no one.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is the unanimous view of the Committee that the kernel of the Highland problem is the effective and efficient use of the land which is basic to everything we are considering today and, indeed, throughout the consideration of this Bill. It seems to me to be quite absurd that we should be discussing a Bill the effectiveness of which depends upon a commodity the ownership of which we do not know very much about.<br><br>
I have been trying for a very long time to find out just who owns what and where and why. One always comes up against a stone wall. I put a Question to the Secretary of State on 28th April this year about the document to which my hon. Friend the Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) referred, Accounts and Papers; Owners of Lands and Heritages, 1872–3 (Scotland). I asked the Secretary of State whether he would seek to ascertain and publish up-to-date statistics on this matter and his Answer was the same as the answer I would have got from a Tory Secretary of State:
<br><blockquote><p>"The changes in land ownership during the past 90 years must have been very considerable. A detailed survey would be necessary to obtain the information my hon. Friend is seeking, and I do not feel that the cost involved would be justified."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 28th April, 1965; Vol. 711, c. <i>61.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I should like to know what the cost would be and whether any estimate of this has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always supposed that each local authority that was a rating authority had a complete list of these valuations comprising the names of the owners and others on the local list and that these lists were to be found at the county or burgh chambers in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows very much more about local government than I. I do not know whether or not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
this is a fact but perhaps the Minister of State will tell us what the difficulties are. Clearly, some estimate must have been made of the cost of conducting this inquiry, otherwise my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would not have given his Answer.<br><br>
It is quite clear that this is not a party political matter. I should like to quote what happened at the Scottish Young Tories Conference in Glasgow in early March of this year as recorded in <i>The Guardian</i> of 8th March. According to the report, a Mr. J. Gordon of the Pentlands branch
<br><blockquote><p>"accused the Conservative Party of being unwilling to do anything about the Highlands because many of the absentee landlords in the Highlands were influential members of the Conservative Party."</p></blockquote>
That is a young Tory speaking to Tories at a Tory conference, so this is clearly a non-party matter. The conference then went on to discuss a resolution, which was passed unanimously, on the desirability of securing a property-owning democracy. The two do not seem to link together very closely: it depends on who owns it, I suppose. There was another gentleman from the Maryhill division—my hon. Friend has quoted him before—Mr. A. Hutton, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The whole question of the unlocking of land in the Highlands is something which we as a party really must look at afresh ourselves. The time is not far off when lairds should consider making the sporting estates of the areas available to a wider public before friction causes abuses and perhaps even confiscation."</p></blockquote>
That is a Conservative talking about confiscation.</span></p>
