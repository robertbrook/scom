<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this opportunity to debate agriculture because since I first entered the House of Commons the only main debate that we have had on agriculture during the hours of daylight has been on the Price Review in which very few Scottish Members had the opportunity of putting forward the Scottish viewpoint. All other discussions of Scottish agriculture so far have taken place in the hours of darkness, late at night on Prayers when most reasonable people were already in bed. It is right, therefore, that at least today we can discuss agriculture in the light of day and not in darkness. It is also gratifying that we have gracing us with his presence this morning the Secretary of State for Scotland. I hope that in these hours of light he will do nothing to obscure our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In taking part in debates in the Scottish Committees and in the House I have noticed the general critical attitude often shown by hon. Members opposite towards agriculture. This betrays failure to appreciate the rôle which agriculture has to play in the economy of this country. This is a time when balance of payments difficulties are looming very large, and it is well to remind ourselves of the part that agriculture plays in saving imports. With output running at a level twice what it was before the war and 60 per cent. higher than in 1945, the import bill is very much smaller than it otherwise might be. So much for what we have achieved. More important is the scope which still remains for the further saving of imports. It has been shown that our imports of temperate foodstuffs at present run at a level of £1,000 million a year, a sum equivalent in value to about three months of exports. This demonstrates the tremendous scope still for import saving on the part of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This makes one wonder whether the Government are sincere in their promises
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
to encourage import-saving industries. If they are sincere, then surely agriculture deserves more support than it was given in the recent Price Review. Milk production, for example, is a section of the industry in which producers are giving up all the time. They are giving up in Scotland at the rate of about one a day. Over the last two years the production of butter has fallen by about 40,000 tons and, as the Chairman of the Milk Marketing Board pointed out in Glasgow last week, this represents an extra charge of £15 million to £20 million on our import bill. This demonstrates how dairy farmers deserve more encouragement and a fairer share of the markets in dairy products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a question not only of saving imports but also of whether in future these imports will be available from overseas. There is no sign of the serious world food situation letting up and it is likely that in years ahead food supplies will be less available. The Secretary of the British Association drew attention in London yesterday to this fact and said that as far as he can see ahead it is unlikely that there will be any relaxing of this world situation. It is not only a matter of more mouths to feed but of the change in the pattern of world trade. This is shown clearly in meat consumption, which in Europe is rising fast. As it rises so there is less meat available to come into Britain from our traditional suppliers—the Argentine, Australia and New Zealand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consumption of meat is rising in South America. This means that there is less meat available there for export to this country and to Europe. Exactly the same applies to Australia and New Zealand where producers are finding greatly increased outlets for their products in industrial Japan. This means that all over the world less meat is available and that what comes to us comes at much higher prices. The increase in dairy production throughout the world has now stopped and surplus stocks of dairy produce are now virtually eliminated. As this happens, prices on the world market begin to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised that as a result of our cheap food policy our beef is at present being diverted from Britain to the Continent. As a consequence, the British
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
housewife has to pay more for the meat which she gets. It is all very well for the housewife and the meat trade to grumble, but what is happening is inevitable in the light of the world supply situation. We cannot, ostrichlike, hide our heads in the sand and think that the world supply situation does not affect us. Thank goodness for this situation, even if prices rise in the shops, as long as it brings home to the Government and the consumer that there is a real case for the increased production of beef in this country, including of course Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the present situation means that we have to export more manufactures from Britain to pay for the same amount of food and that the terms of trade move against us as an exporting country. As this happens, so more urgent becomes our task in British agriculture in replacing imports of food from overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well to remember the particular situation of British agriculture when compared with other industries. This is in contrast to the suggestion which some people make that farming enjoys a specially favoured position. It is well to remember that British farmers produce in direct competition with suppliers overseas. They do not have the benefit of tariff protection such as manufacturing industry has—for example, the 25 per cent. tariff which the motor car manufacturers enjoy. In addition, the cost of agriculture to the British taxpayer has been falling since 1961 in real terms. The level last year was the lowest in real terms since 1955/56. At the same time, we should bear in mind that consumer prices in Britain are the lowest of any country in Western Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are showing their eagerness to pin prices and keep them down and are exhorting industry to absorb rising costs. Prices in food production are the lowest and the most stable of all prices, and agriculture is the one industry which each year at the Price Review is forced, whether it likes it or not, to absorb £25 million of rising costs. If all industries followed the example of agriculture, there would be no need for a Prices and Incomes Board. In these circumstances the Government should be more generous and should not hold down and restrict agricultural production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
It is against this background that farmers in Scotland regarded the Price Review of last February. It is not just a question of prices being inadequate to cover costs and to give a reasonable income, important though that is. It is not just a question of incomes in the farming community lagging behind incomes elsewhere, a fact which cannot be disputed. It is much more a question of agriculture not being given a fair chance to play its part in the economy of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a much more dangerous threat still looming up. One of the conditions of the 1947 Act was that agricultural prices should be consistent with an adequate return on capital. This is important because if they are not we shall not get the investment necessary to give us technological improvement and the increased productivity which is so necessary for the future prosperity of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth our while to remember the very good record which agriculture has in increasing productivity, a record which if equalled by any other section of British industry would solve many of our present difficulties. Growth in agriculture has been particularly fast. Anything which hinders this growth is to be very much deprecated. In paragraph 3 of the 1965 Price Review White Paper the Government said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider therefore that a primary objective of future agricultural policy must be to encourage this growth in productivity through:—
	<ol>
	<li>the maintenance of stability in the industry;</li>
	<li>the further progressive introduction of new technological improvements …".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This pious hope expressed in the White Paper will go completely unfulfilled unless farmers receive a better return on capital than they have at present prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this respect I would draw the attention of the Secretary of State to an article in 	<i>Scottish Agricultural Economics</i> on the return on capital in Scottish agriculture. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman has read it. If not I recommend him to do so, and he would do well to pass it on to his right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture. This article shows that the return on fixed capital, buildings and land has been running over recent years
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
at as low a level as 2 per cent. It also shows that the return on stock and machinery, including the return on management, has been running in recent years at a level of only between 6½ per cent. and 9 per cent. That figure is not only the return on capital but also includes an element of return on management. If we compare the return on capital in industry, even including the nationalised industries, it will make us realise how often there must be a positive disincentive to further investment in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we couple to this the 9 per cent. Bank Rate which we had in recent months and the depreciation of investment allowances under the Finance Bill, we must regard the Government's attitude as paying only lip service to these aims of technological improvement. By their own actions, the Government are putting a brake on investment and on innovation and on new development in Scottish agriculture. A clear example of this can be seen in what is happening in the machinery trade. Anyone who talks to machinery dealers, as I have in recent months, will be told that, over the past six months, sales of new machinery have been declining and old machinery has not been replaced at the same rate as in recent years. This is but one manifestation of the Government's policy to which attention should be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where, now, are the Government's preelection promises of cheaper capital? All we have in the Price Review is an extension of credit under the Agriculture and Horticulture Acts, but no special terms such as were promised before last October. Where are their plans to improve the structure of agriculture? We heard plenty about that before last October. All we have now is the farm business recording scheme. Perhaps the Secretary of State will tell us a little more about that. We know very little about it as it affects Scotland, how it is likely to develop, what effects he hopes it will have, and, in particular, whether Scotland is to participate in one of the pilot schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In capital assistance to agriculture, one scheme of particular benefit to Scotland has been the Farm Improvement Scheme. Anyone, whether he works in the agricultural community or not, must be aware, as he goes through the countryside, of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
tremendous change which has taken place in the modernisation of farm buildings. One can see this from the roadside and get a good impression, but if one sees what is happening inside the buildings one realises what a tremendous benefit the scheme has been to Scottish farmers. It has led to a much quicker uptake of new management techniques, new types of buildings and so on. But there is still a slight question mark hanging over the scheme. It is due to expire in two years' time, and it would be interesting to hear from the Secretary of State whether the scheme is expected to continue or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of more capital could be of particular help in the hill and upland areas. These areas are a vital part of the whole agricultural economy, being a source of store stock in store lambs and store cattle, yet this is a sector of agriculture in which capital is very often at its shortest. There is a case here for extending the Farm Improvement Scheme to give a rate slightly higher than the one-third for capital improvements in these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought that the Hill Farming Act and the Livestock Rearing Act, which gave a higher rate of capital assistance to these areas were of great benefit, but the scheme under these Acts was discontinued two years ago because, I understand, not enough people were making use of it. I suggest that the reason why the scheme was not being used so much before was that, in order to qualify under it, a farmer had to prepare a comprehensive scheme covering the whole farm. He was not able to do single improvements, one at a time; any improvements had to be part of a whole scheme. Although a scheme could be spread over a period of years, it was often too daunting for the individual farmer and beyond his capital resources. This, I believe, was the reason why the scheme was not more used, and there are strong grounds for extending the Farm Improvement Scheme to a higher rate of assistance in these areas. It could make our upland farms very much more viable than they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another very profitable sector for investment, and one which is largely the responsibility of the Government, is the fighting of disease. Livestock farming in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
Scotland is by far the greatest single sector of our agriculture, yet, despite its value, over the country as a whole very nearly 10 per cent. of our gross output—very nearly £100 million, it is estimated—is lost every year through the ravages of disease. I pay tribute to the great work which has been done and is still being done in Scotland in our research organisations and institutes and also by our private and public veterinary services, but there is a tremendous amount still to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I single out for particular attention preventive medicine. Scotland blazed the trail in the eradication of tuberculosis. We are now, I hope, leading the way in the eradication of swine fever. I want the Secretary of State to tell us how the swine fever scheme is going. The Highland Show a fortnight ago—almost a blueprint of what happened last year as well—raised a lot of concern among pig keepers in Scotland about the success of the swine fever eradication scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another direction for a big extension of preventive medicine lies in the eradication of brucellosis. We have already discussed this in debates in the House, and we should like a more positive assurance from the Secretary of State that the Government are taking the matter seriously. The cost of the disease in dairying is known fairly well, but the cost to our beef herds is not known nearly so well. When this aspect of the matter is coupled to the grave danger of brucellosis to public health, one sees at once that this is a matter to which the Government ought to pay close attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, the question of marketing. In passing, I mention the situation as regards potatoes. I welcome the Government's proposal announced last week to co-operate with the Potato Marketing Board and to give it powers to intervene slightly earlier in the potato market. This was something which we on this side recommended last winter and on which the Potato Marketing Board itself exerted a lot of pressure. Yet the Minister of Agriculture stubbornly refused to do anything then, with the result that prices were depressed even further and the final cost of the buying programme was pushed up much higher than the level at which it might have been had the Government permitted the Potato
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
Marketing Board to intervene more quickly. I am glad that the Government have at last learnt their lesson in this respect. Nevertheless, even when the Potato Marketing Board does intervene, prices in Scotland, particularly in the north of Scotland, are very often £3 or £4 per ton or even larger sums below the average for the rest of the country, and producers in these areas suffer a great disability in relation to producers elsewhere when prices are depressed. I want the Government to look again at the question whether the Potato Marketing Board could be permitted to intervene on a regional basis when prices fall below the average in the region, not just over the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest question mark at the moment hangs over the Government's plans for a meat authority. Over the past weeks and months we have been awaiting an announcement, yet we are still no nearer to its actually being made. As we wait, so the uncertainty grows. One can hardly open a paper now but read of some section of the industry or the retail or wholesale trade trying to guess at what is happening. I hope that the Government will not delay in announcing their proposals for the meat commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, when they do make their announcement, it will be plain that the Secretary of State has made sure that Scotland's special position is absolutely clear. The position of the industry in Scotland is not the same as it is throughout the rest of the country. Scotland's interests tend to be different. We are a net exporter of meat. Another factor which must not be forgotten is that for producers in Scotland quality is far more important than it is for producers in England. Two years ago, the Government removed the quality element from the price guarantee scheme. In my personal opinion, this was to the detriment of many Scottish producers, and I hope that in their proposals for a meat authority and for meat marketing the Government will not forget Scotland's special position as a producer of quality meat, whether beef, bacon or lamb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what I have said I have tried to show that the Government have not made a good start in their handling of agriculture. In the way they handled the Agricultural Price Review they gave
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
farmers very little confidence in the future and in how they would handle the whole question of meat marketing. They have failed to understand the background against which farmers have to work. They have not appreciated the balance of payments situation and how agriculture can help it. They have not appreciated the world food shortage and the changing patterns of world trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with a quotation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purchase prices of a number of agricultural products have not covered the expenditures incurred in their production and the numerous reorganisations have engendered an atmosphere of nervousness and fuss. Agriculture has been set great aims which have not been backed up by the necessary economic measures, and from the centre there have gone out all kinds of stereotyped instructions in which local experience and the natural and economic conditions have been ignored".</p></blockquote>
This quotation could well have come from some critic of the Government's agricultural policy since last October. In fact, it did not. It was said by the First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party about Soviet agriculture. I trust that our Government will adopt the same attitude of self-criticism. If they do, it will be to the benefit of agriculture and to the benefit of Scottish farmers, and it will certainly make our task even easier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It falls to me to congratulate the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) on his very able first speech from the Opposition Front Bench. It was clear. It was confident. It was occasionally good party stuff. We welcome this in the Scottish Committee. The hon. Gentleman certainly covered the subject very fairly and very well from his point of view. At times, I wondered whether we had been the Government during the past fourteen years or so when all the problems he mentioned in marketing, import difficulties, Scotland's share of the market and so on, were developing. Had he been in the House a few years earlier, there might have been more fight and more substance in what he said in relation to the uncritical and adulant attitude of those among whom he might have found himself on his own side as a back bencher.

I do not intend to go over all the arguments about the outcome of the Price

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
Review. We have had our debates on the Floor of the House, and they were not uncontested. If I remember aright, they were carried into Prayers and Adjournment debates, and we had very specialised discussions on aspects of Scottish agriculture. But I welcome this opportunity to have a much wider look at Scottish agriculture and, at the same time, to deal with particular points which are highlighted during the debate. In our earlier debates, I expressed the view that the Government's determinations were fair and just and in many respects provided a starting point for new developments. To expect us, within so short a time, to produce solutions of problems which had developed and had been seen to be developing in Scottish agriculture and in the world agricultural outlook was a compliment to us, and we take it as such. We shall certainly bend our minds to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt of the importance of agriculture, but there is equally no doubt that, since the war, there has been a period of unparalleled stability and prosperity in agriculture. The previous Government and the Labour Government of 1945–51 had much to commend themselves for in this. The present Government are looking forward, and it is this forward-looking note which I want to strike as I look at the picture of Scottish agriculture today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1964, the weather conditions were much more favourable than in 1963 and the industry made a good recovery from the setback which it had experienced in the earlier year. The value of gross output increased by nearly £11 million and amounted to £195 million in the year ending May, 1965. This is not in keeping with the picture of gloom which the hon. Gentleman painted with his figures, saying that there was a failure and lack of investment and that this would lead to a slowing down. This has not been in evidence when one considers the prices which people are prepared to pay for farms in the open market and the competition there is for them.

The output of farm and horticultural crops was worth about £47 million and the volume of crop output is now 20 per cent. higher than 10 years ago. The tillage acreage fell slightly compared with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
1963, but within that, there was a large increase in the barley acreage which, for the first time, exceeded that of oats. Barley production was 50 per cent. higher than that of oats. The yields of cereal crops in 1964, particularly of wheat and barley, were well above average. This illustrates how Scottish farmers have been able, by applying the results of plant breeding and the developments which have been pioneered by our institutes, to put land to the proper use, to increase output and thus help to reduce unit costs. The extent to which unit costs are being and still can be reduced tends to be overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a disappointing year for farm incomes in 1963–64 the increase in value of output in 1964–65 should more than offset the increase in farming costs and result in some increase in net incomes in 1964–65. I agree with what the hon. Member said about the ability of agriculture to absorb these increases in costs. I wish that industries were not so ready to increase their prices before seeking ways and means of absorbing a share of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Acreage of potatoes was the same as in the previous year. Yields were well up to average but the crop did not store well. I will deal later with the hon. Member's points about research and what can be done towards eradication of diseases which affect potatoes and other things.

Livestock remains the mainstay of Scottish farming. The beef herd continues to expand slowly, which is the way it expands. What we have to do is keep pushing it forward and keeping in mind world food demand and production. The tonnage of beef produced has fallen slightly, resulting more from some decline in the supply of stores from Ireland and in slaughtering of cows. Sheep production remains steady. There was a considerable expansion in the pig population and output in 1964, and a further increase is expected this year. This is not an unhealthy picture of Scottish agriculture and not nearly so gloomy as the hon. Member painted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of milk producers has declined, but milk production in the year ended May 1965 was higher than in the previous year despite that and there was a substantial improvement in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
pool price, and the gross returns on milk production in Scotland are estimated to have increased by £3 million in 1964–65. In egg production there is a continuing increase in yields and efficiency, though there has not been the same development of large-scale poultry enterprises in Scotland as south of the Border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the important points is the change in employment in Scottish agriculture. This tends to be overlooked, because it is a fact of agriculture and of other problems as well. Employment in Scottish farming continues to fall. There was a reduction of 6 per cent. in the number of farmworkers in 1964. The figure is down, I think, for 1964 as compared with 1963, from about 54,100 to 50,600. If we take the 10-year period, I am sure that I am right in saying that the figure of employment in agriculture at that time was over 90,000 in all categories. In agricultural areas in Scotland, we have had year after year this continued loss of employment. The implications of this for policies other than purely agricultural policies are something which I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not refer to, and that we did not hear more about them from hon. Gentlemen opposite in past years. This is an aggravation of the migration problem from the country districts of Scotland. It is certainly concerning us. One of the things from which this results is the mechanisation and investment which the hon. Gentleman mentioned and which has been supported by Governments since the war. It has led to increased efficiency, and the saving in labour is offset by rises in wage rates. It has also meant that agriculture has been freeing reserves for growth of certain sectors of the economy. However, the social aspects of decline in employment in the remoter areas need to be carefully watched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member spoke about education and research and the improvement to agriculture which has been seen in the results. In 1965–66, at the eight research institutes and three agricultural colleges grant-aided by the Scottish Office, capital expenditure will be well over £400,000. This includes an instalment towards the new building at Aberdeen, the foundation stone of which I had the honour of setting ten days ago. The building will house the North of Scotland Agricultural College and the Agricultural Department
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
of Aberdeen University and will contribute to the union of university teaching with college teaching and the advisory services. The cost of maintenance in these institutes and colleges will be over £3 million in 1965–66—not an inconsiderable sum, but it is a not inconsiderable sum devoted to a considerably important industry. The Government give this free service to agriculture, and I am glad to say that agriculture responds more and more by accepting the conditions which come from it. Its results are not directly measurable, but there is no doubt that the nation is getting a real return in the increasing productivity in the industry. We in Scotland suffered a severe blow through the sudden death of Professor Donald Hendrie, of the Chair of Agriculture in Glasgow University, who was also Principal of the West of Scotland Agricultural College.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal now with the points which the hon. Member raised related to disease. We are following through to see what can be done about eradication. The eradication scheme for swine fever is going very well. We have not been troubled to the same extent in Scotland as south of the Border, and we want to try to maintain our position. As the hon. Member said, we all regretted that we got more or less a repeat of what happened last year at the Highland Show. We have to bear in mind the importance of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to impose restrictions was the right one. A very considerable expense is involved if this thing gets going. We have no reason to be concerned about the general picture. I am satisfied that the progress now being made in eradication is good. As with the most important animal diseases, we are more fortunate than our southern neighbours. During the first calendar year during which the scheme operated, from 11th March, 1963, outbreaks in Scotland totalled 136 as compared with 242 in 1962, and last year only 15 outbreaks were confirmed. There have been no confirmed outbreaks this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also mentioned brucellosis and the need to get improvements here. He has been prominent in this. I know that the hon. Member would prefer an eradication scheme for this rather than a scheme of voluntary and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
free vaccination which we have at present. He will appreciate that it would be terribly expensive. The estimate quoted by the Minister of Agriculture in another debate was between £40 million and £50 million. I can assure him that we have not lost sight of the force of the argument. It is being examined. I am not prepared now to say that we are going in for the wholesale eradication scheme which he suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to deal with cereal marketing. We have lost no time—the hon. Gentleman might have given us a little credit for marketing—in pressing on with two important developments affecting the interests of arable farmers. They are cereal marketing and potato marketing. We have now established the Home Grown Cereals Marketing Authority, and Scotland is reasonably well represented on it. Mr. Pattullo from Kirriemuir represents producers, and the U.K. merchants are represented by Mr. Gray of Stirling. The Chairman of the Authority is not unrelated to Scotland. For about eight years he was connected with Scottish Agricultural Industries, and for four of those years he was the chairman. Their task of maintaining growth and stability in marketing home grown cereal crops is one which we all commend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have authorised the collection of levies from wheat and barley deficiency payments to provide the funds considered by the Authority to be necessary to enable it to do its job in the first year. There has been a certain amount of controversy over the levy for barley. We were not able to introduce a levy related to sales. This might have been construed as affecting those who consume on the farm rather than sell. We cannot do this in that way in the first year because of the complexity of the matter. We shall see whether the differences are such that we should make changes in the following year. I am sure that the Authority, in getting off to a good start, carries the good wishes of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said something about potatoes. The argument about support buying potatoes is an old one. This is not the first year that there have been arguments that the Potato Marketing Board was too late in stepping in. The hon. Gentleman should remember the conditions laid upon the Board by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
his Government. The first thing which the Government had to deal with was, that there was a massive surplus. Secondly, there was the lowering of price and its effect on payment. The hon. Member might have given us some praise for having made the change. His Government did not make the change, but we have. The Minister announced on 29th June that we have reached agreement with the Potato Marketing Board and the National Farmers' Unions, including the Scottish Union, about changes in the arrangements for support buying of potatoes in supplement of the guaranteed price machinery. A joint support buying programme was authorised. The changes are designed to make the arrangements more flexible, because we wiped out the massive surplus and made arrangements much more flexible. At the same time the arrangements for sharing the cost can be worked out when the operation is over and the cost is known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements are such that they will encourage the Government and the Board to make a more realistic appraisal of the need for support buying programmes in particular circumstances. There will aways be a difference between England and Scotland because there is always traditionally the reflection of price differential in relation to coming on to the market. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I will not give way. I have pages and pages, and I want to do justice to the fine speech made by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have agreed to discuss with the Unions at their request an increase in the standard quantity of milk and a reconsideration of the marketing arrangements. Once again, we are dealing with milk. We are prepared to go carefully and thoroughly into these matters with the Unions. It is recognised on all sides that milk is one of the most important items in the farming economy and of great importance to the country generally as an item in the diet. The Government's interest is to see that supplies of liquid milk are adequate to meet foreseeable needs and that the producer gets a fair return for his efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The price received by the producer depends primarily on the proportion of total production which can find an outlet in the liquid milk market. Increased
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
production without a similar expansion of the liquid market depresses the pool price, and the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns must be aware of this—that is, unless we accept his argument willy-nilly and give the same price in relation to the butter and cheese market and push up considerably the price of food in this country. We must take a balanced view of this. In 1964–65 the average price received by producers throughout Britain was 3s. l½d. per gallon. The price ranged from 2s. 9d. to 2s. 10½d. per gallon in previous years, and in the Scottish Milk Marketing Board's area the price received was 3s. 1¼d., or 2·25d. and 3·4d. per gallon higher than in 1963 and 1964 respectively. The Board has calculated that for 1965 the Review award will mean a further 6d. increase, allowing for milk being sold for manufacture and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much publicity and concern has been expressed about the number of farmers going out of milk production. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) and a number of hon. Gentlemen opposite have put Questions to me on the subject. People go out of milk production for a number of reasons, not all of which are related purely to the question of the Price Review. Some of their reasons are related to the economic circumstances of their farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what has been happening. The fall in the period December, 1959, to December, 1964, amounted to 14 per cent. I hope that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns will not hold the present Government's policies responsible for that. The dairy herd fell during that period not by 14 per cent. but by only 3 per cent.—and this is something which should be kept in mind; the fact that the dairy herd has tended to increase, if anything, even as the number of milk producers has fallen. That increase in the dairy herd—as represented in relation to the decline in the number of people in milk production—plus an increased yield has meant that the actual milk production has not fallen to the extent one might have expected when considering the reduction of 14 per cent. in the number of people in milk production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to suggest a likely shortage in liquid milk supplies. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
trend suggests more economic units and increased specialisation. In the last two years, when Scottish milk production has been somewhat lower than it was previously, the reserves going to the manufacturing market has been equivalent to 70 per cent. of the liquid demand. Even at the time of the year when the pressure on demand is the greatest, the reserves did not fall below 34 per cent. of that figure. We must, therefore, be realistic about this matter of milk production. The home producer's share of the market for milk products has, on the whole, been well maintained and it is now a good deal higher than it was before and immediately after the war. That is natural.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman say what the percentage was?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say immediately, but I will try to find out the figure and let the hon. Gentleman know later in our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have indicated, this is a relatively low-priced market and increased production to keep pace with demand could arise only if there were a reduction in the pool price paid to producers. If hon. Members look at past Price Review agreements on this issue they will see that previous Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Secretaries of State for Scotland have had to face farmers with this very dilemma. We must remember that we are a trading nation and that our traditional suppliers in these commodities have been New Zealand and Denmark. We cannot shrug them off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are some of the matters, which we will have to examine with the Unions. I cannot say more about that now. However, we are not unaware of the importance of this matter and the benefits that could accrue if we could achieve this increase in relation to milk going to manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dairy herd can and has been used as a source of beef, and this is a desirable thing. When we consider the contribution made by the dairy herd to national beef supplies we find that it is an important contribution, even in Scotland despite the interest there in the traditional methods of rearing beef cattle, with the emphasis on quality. There has been a heavy demand for beef in the last two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
years and the beef market has undoubtedly proved a useful outlet for surplus animals from the dairy herd. As a measure to encourage an expansion in the home production of beef, the Government have decided to extend the calf subsidy to animals which were hitherto excluded, provided that on slaughter they were equivalent to animals coming under the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme. This will apply to certain types of dairy heifers which are not required for the dairy herd and it should encourage the use of suitable dairy calves from among the 80,000 or so which are still being slaughtered annually in Scotland as soon as they are born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of beef production generally, while the Government have decided to extend the calf subsidy in this way, they have also decided to raise the rate of subsidy in a way which should encourage the supply of beef animals. With the same aim in mind, the Hill Cow Subsidy payment was increased by £1 per head and the guaranteed price for fat cattle has been increased by 4s. per head, from 170s. to 174s. We have, therefore, injected a considerable amount of capital at all points in respect of the beef market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite can say that it is not enough, but other people with ideas and who have claims on these schemes have not looked with such disdain at the efforts which have been made, first on our expenditure of public money and secondly on the aspects of the actual prices paid and received. I suggest that hon. Gentlemen opposite get a slightly more balanced view and approach to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beef production is a long-term business and we have agreed to the Union's request for discussions on the possibility of developing longer-term policies. We must consider the extent to which fluctuations in policy may impede the expansion which is so desirable in this sphere. In the meantime, we are confident that the measures we have taken to inject extra money at key points in the production process will provide an effective means of encouraging the home production which is now so necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns referred to meat marketing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
and suggested that hon. Members were waiting hourly and daily, so to speak. I hope that he will not have to wait much longer for us to make a statement, although I am not able to make a statement at the moment. We have had meetings with the main interested organisations, including the Scottish N.F.U., to discuss the proposals arising out of the Verdon Smith Report for improving the production and marketing of livestock. Their views are being examined. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I assure hon. Gentlemen opposite that we have had a considerable amount of agreement on this matter and that we are probably very much nearer to the point of making an announcement than the laughter of particularly the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) seemed to imply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I try to persuade the right hon. Gentleman on this point? If I understand him aright, an announcement is imminent or will be made within the next few weeks. In view of what he has already admitted to be the predominant interest of meat production and, therefore, of meat-marketing, to Scotland, could we not persuade him that this Committee should have the first news of what proposals he adopts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that if this Committee were meeting when the statement was ready to be made, it would be made known in this Committee. However, we are often being told that the first news should be announced in the House rather than in Committee. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it every way. He cannot criticise us on the one hand for not making statements on the Floor of the House and at the same time, on the other hand, criticise us for not making statements in Committee. We will do our best to meet him on this point, and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement before the House rises for the Summer Recess, whenever that may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns spoke about the farm business records scheme. Work has been going on on this, but on a voluntary basis. I understand that Mr. Joughin, of the Scottish N.F.U., has been playing a personal part in this development with the colleges. We must have a pilot scheme based on the three colleges. We intend to proceed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
on a county basis with certain counties having the pilot scheme. This is an entirely new departure from the point of view of the Government giving financial help. It is desirable that farmers should have the best means of keeping proper records. We have been discussing the nature of the records, not only with the Unions but also with the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I hope that I will be able to make a further announcement on this matter soon. I will do so as soon as matters have been fixed. The hon. Gentleman need not worry on this issue because we have not lost sight of the advantages to Scotland of going ahead with this development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question of the Farm Improvement Scheme. We are considering this and I assure the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns, who spoke about the possibility of it dying a death, that it is a matter of rationalising it. Considerable benefits are available under the Scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman harked back to the comprehensive scheme in relation to upland farms, but I am sure that he knows the history of this matter. It started in 1946 and was to have lasted for five years. It was continued for another five years and continued further by the party opposite which was in power at the time. It was again reconsidered in 1963 by the then Conservative Government. It had been deliberately written in that the Scheme would end 17 years after it first started. Thus, the hon. Gentleman could have had two goes at his Government about the finality of the Scheme. I suggest that 17 years was a reasonably long period for Scottish farmers to take advantage of the Scheme. Speaking from memory, I think that about 3,000 Scottish farmers benefited from the Scheme and that the amount of money spent on it totalled about £25 million. That is an indication of what has been paid for the improvement of Scottish agriculture by the State during these years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns was pessimistic in saying that no help is available. A great deal of specified help is available, particularly when we consider comprehensive help, for those who wish to make improvements. We are looking at this matter from the point of view not of wiping it out but of rationalising and working on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
experience we have of the Farm Improvement Scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made reference to the improvement of the structure of agriculture in the White Paper. Following the Annual Price Review, the Government are giving consideration to three important subjects: the further extension of agricultural co-operative and group activity; the development of upland areas; and the structural improvement of agriculture. As we said in the White Paper, we are anxious to help those people who find it difficult to earn a satisfactory full-time livelihood because of the small size of their holdings and because of the character of the land—in other words, the people to whom we normally refer as small farmers and marginal farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been looking into all possible ways of helping them. We have been considering the benefits which can arise from the development of co-operative activity. We have been looking at the more fundamental problems involved in the upland areas. We must face the fact that there may well remain holdings too small ever to provide a reasonable livelihood. We have been considering what steps can be taken to improve the structure of farming by encouraging voluntary amalgamation of such unsatisfactory holdings. We have given a great deal of thought to all these matters in recent months and we hope shortly to be in a position to seek the views of the organisations concerned on specific proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a bad record of activity on problems which have not been unknown in agriculture over a considerable number of years. We must add to this the problems which arise not from a drift from agriculture, because it is not a drift from agriculture, but a move away from agriculture because of the employment problems which mechanisation and modernisation create in the rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that our agricultural inheritance was not trouble-free. It could not have been trouble-free for any Government, because developments in agriculture have been moving fast. This creates problems which gain impetus as agriculture becomes more modernised. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government will continue to give that priority to agriculture

which it merits and will bear in mind its importance in the life and well-being of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that it was anticipated that there would be a rise in net farm incomes. While this may be true in an academic sense from the point of view of the returns which were agreed in the recent Price Review, I am sure that there can be no one in this Committee connected with the farming industry who does not realise that anything done to bring about an increase in incomes has been more than wiped out by the actions of the Secretary of State and his colleagues in their general economic policy since they assumed office. This is one of the things which worries those interested in agriculture more than anything else. Not only do we have a steady decline in the value of money, with the pound going down by Id. every month we have a Socialist Government, but extra taxes have been imposed. All this contributes towards eroding the income which the farmers expect to receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State paid tribute to what the farming industry does in managing to absorb some of its own costs, but I should like him to consider the attitude of his right hon. Friend who is connected with a trade union which is meeting in another place today and the effect that it will have on the costs of transport, repairs to machinery and everything which makes up expenses in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), who opened the debate so ably, mentioned potatoes. The Secretary of State skated round this thorny problem—perhaps he thought, skilfully—but I should like to draw his attention to the fact that this current year is the most disastrous that the potato growers in Scotland have had and that he and his right hon. Friend are directly responsible for it. The Under-Secretary of State, in answer to a Question which I put in the House, said that in 1961–62 the average price which Scottish farmers received for potatoes was £17 10s. a ton, that the following year it was £17 5s. and that in the next year it was £15 6s. Up to 3rd April this year, however, the average price received by potato growers was £12 14s. 9d. This was at a time when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
the majority of clamps were dressed out for seed and therefore the major part of the crop was on the market. A surplus existed, and went on existing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know this from my personal experience. As a farmer, I declare an interest in receiving guarantees through the Potato Marketing Board. I had to sell surplus potatoes to the Board. They remained surplus, and I had to buy them back and put them in a silage pit. For months the farming leaders told the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State that this would happen. They paid no attention. They have caused very real hardship to farmers throughout Scotland. This affects particularly those who grow stock seed potatoes and who take a great deal of trouble in inspecting and cultivating their potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cash return of these men depends very much on potatoes. How can they replace their equipment? How can they find the money, during the biggest credit squeeze we have had, to replace machinery, when not only the return on the main crop goes down, but the business of getting credit makes it more difficult for them to do so? I hope that we can be grateful that a new and more flexible arrangement on potatoes has been made. Let us be under no illusion that, as a result of the Government's actions, potato growers have had the most disastrous year in their experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman deal with the total income? Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman forgets that, particularly in the seed trade in Scotland, whether there is a surplus or not, only a certain amount of seed will be used for planting because we work on a basic average. Seed potatoes this year were sold at £8 or £10 a ton. This means that the seed which people had to sell brought in half the amount of money which was brought in the year before. There is no other means of getting rid of the surplus. This is the cause of the trouble. If the scheme had been operating, the Board could have taken the surplus potatoes off the market at an earlier date and given the growers a proper return on

their skill and work in producing the crop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there is a sugar beet factory at Cupar. This is of great interest to farmers in Angus, Perthshire and the Lothians. If the return on potatoes becomes less, what alternative crops do farmers grow? If, as seems likely, the increased use of pesticides controlling aphids in areas of England which used to buy seed potatoes from Scotland continues, there will be a decreasing demand for seed potatoes from Scotland. There is therefore a great need for farmers to find an alternative crop which can be grown profitably in Scotland. Sugar beet is one of these crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas up to two or three years ago the Cupar sugar beet factory was fully occupied, and, in fact, was turning away acreage, the present bad season, which has meant a decrease in the tonnages of sugar beet, has made the growing of sugar beet less profitable in Scotland. There is a real need for the price structure for the Cupar sugar beet factory to be reconsidered. I see no reason why it is impossible to deal with the price for sugar beet in Scotland in a slightly different way from the price of sugar beet paid in Lincolnshire and other parts of England where there are much more favourable growing conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to the livestock industry. He gave the impression that things were going nicely, but I hope that he, together with most other right hon. and hon. Members, will have observed a letter from the North Country Cheviot Sheep Society which points out that the interest of members of the Society
	<br><blockquote><p>"as producers of fat lamb and mutton have been most unfairly treated in the recent Price Review and that we are asked to accept a price that is actually less than it was ten years ago. This in spite of the fact that our costs have increased by almost 50 per cent."</p></blockquote>
This is borne out by what was said in a recent article by Mr. Wannop, the Director of the Hill Farming Research Association, in which he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The financial returns of hill farming have been declining in the past seven or eight years. Though farm income may be no less, the costs have risen quite markedly and if hill farming is to keep its place 	<i>vis a vis</i> other types of fanning something needs to be done to increase the income for each individual concerned. In short we must sell more lambs,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
wool and cast ewes per shepherd. Output per man will become increasingly important as automation affects industry and in turn farming."</p></blockquote>
It is very much easier if one is on a lowland farm where one can put up a big beef feeding lot and have one man feeding 200 cattle instead of 70 or 80. This is not easy to do with hill farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is too lackadaisical about his approach to increasing the beef herd, which he said was expanding slowly. It is by expanding the beef herd in hill farming that we shall keep the hill pastures improved and, by having both sheep and cattle on the hills, produce more meat to the acre than in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a good thing in the hill farming districts if we considered the scheme adopted in Ireland, where an increased subsidy of £15 is paid for every calving heifer added to the herd. If a man has a herd of 50 cows on a hill and increases it to 60 cows, he gets an extra subsidy on the ten additional animals. This would be a way to bring much needed money into hill farming, and, at the same time, to increase the number of beef cattle on the hill. This would also go towards solving the problem to which reference has been made about the shortage in the supply of store cattle from Ireland. If the competition from the Continent in meat continues, this is something that we must anticipate. At the next Price Review we must see whether something can be done to ensure that more cattle are put on the hill land in Scotland.

I am satisfied that it is still not realised that we are in (the midst of a great revolution in agriculture. Indeed, a revolution is taking place, not only in agriculture, but throughout our economy. We are in the process of change. Almost a hurricane of change is taking place. The changes which are affecting people in the country are being resisted, to a certain extent, by the natural conservatism of people. This applies not only to those who vote Conservative, but to those who, naturally, do not want to change their job and do not wish to be disturbed.

The farmers are experiencing this change as well and my right hon. Friend has mentioned the number of people who have left agriculture. A good many years ago I made a study of what was happening in Wales, at the request of a certain body. We found that there was a great exodus of people from the farms into the towns. When we examined the matter we found that it was not a case of something being wrong with the farms. It was a case of something being right in the rest of the economy. During the depressed period between the wars people who could not find jobs or even food in the towns went back to their friends and families on the farms. The result was that the farms were carrying a population far greater than was necessary for the working of the economy of the countryside. This applies today in Scotland. With the advance of mechanisation and the revolution which has taken place in the whole productivity of farming, Naturally, people will not stay on the farms where they have nothing to do. As a result our farms have been able to absorb a great part of their costs and to work more economically and efficiently. This is not a matter for complaint but for congratulation. It is only by moving forward in this process and progress that the country will survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mining areas have had to suffer depopulation in the same way. Inefficient mines have been closed, just as inefficient farms must close down. Aircraft factories which are inefficient or unnecessary are closed down. We are witnessing in the economic activities of people a great change which is necessary if the country is to be modern and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
One of the things which those who face change are failing to realise is that it is not the business of a Government to keep people always in the same jobs and in the same conditions as prevailed in the past. There can be no progress if there is no change, and change often means that people must change their occupations. This can be very hard on them, and what it is up to the Government to do is to see that the changes take place in the interests of the population as a whole and that individuals do not suffer personally because of the general progress of society.

Farmers in pre-war days had to suffer from the chaos of marketing and the chaos of Nature. Reference has been made to potatoes. They were always the classic example of the vagaries of Nature. I remember speaking to a big farmer in north Berwick. I was sympathising with him on his small crop of potatoes that year. He said: "Do not sympathise with me. Sympathise with the consumer. He has to pay a high price." One year when there was a scarcity of potatoes prices went up and then every farmer went in for potato production in the following year. Down came the prices because there was a surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Party programme introduced by Dr. Addison, one of the greatest benefactors of agriculture, was designed to try to iron out the fluctuations which brought prosperity one year and near-starvation the next. Farmers had had to sell at £2 a ton and the wretched consumer had to pay £11 a ton. The farmer was nearly bankrupt or in the hands of the moneylender. Dr. Addison's policy was to ensure that the farmer would receive advice and foreknowledge a year or two ahead of what he would receive for his crops. We cannot control Nature and we cannot control fluctuations in production which can vary by as much as from five tons to seven tons per acre. The Government cannot control that, but they can control the balance of planning and the attempt to keep matters on a better regulated basis.

This accounts for the change in recent years in milk production. When milk marketing, was prosperous, everybody went in for milk production and when the production rose there was the problem of disposal. Miners are anxious to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that it has been necessary to keep costs down. Agricultural foodstuffs are an important element in these costs. Exports from this country were subsidised in the past on the stomachs of the coalminers and the starvation of farmers and farmworkers. A great deal is being done to redress that balance by trying to be fair to the whole community. The purpose of the Price Review was to see that the balance was maintained by being fair to everybody. The purpose of the Review is to keep agriculture producing the right stuff at the right time.

Everybody has agreed this morning with the Government that the need now is to stimulate beef production because there is a market for it, but it would be ridiculous to stimulate milk production if there were no mouths to drink it. The Conservative Government bear some responsibility for this situation

Farmers cannot complain a great deal about past policy, because for 13 years they have had a policy and a Government of their own choosing. A great deal has been said about farmers' incomes. I agree that, measured in terms of economic return on capital, farmers' incomes would compare badly with those of people in industry, but the point is that in the main farmers are not in the industry merely for money. It is a way of life and many people make sacrifices for that way of life. The Secretary of State for Scotland

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
said today that many people are prepared to pay more money to get into this way of life. Farmers are entitled to a proper income, but that income is not easily measured. It cannot be measured in terms of £.s.d.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my time the Government put £300,000,000 into British farming as capital to enable stock to grow and the country to expand its agriculture. This, as has been said, resulted over the years in an increase of 62 per cent. in productivity. I am glad to say that Governments following the Labour Government carried out this policy. This increased productivity in Scottish farming. As a former Secretary of State for Scotland I should like to pay tribute to the farmers for their forward view and their wish to take advantage of every scientific aid. Scottish farmers compare well with, if they are not even better than, any farmers in the world in making the best use of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see, however, a comprehensive view being taken of what is to happen in farming. The revolution in farming is proceeding at a pace which our policies are not fitted to meet. One thinks of the advances in factory farming and in mechanisation and of the general evolution which may catch up with us before we are ready for it. Something must be done to establish what the pattern of Scottish farming should be during the next 50 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a social as well as an economic purpose in farming. Hill farms should be continued for social as well as purely economic reasons, but if they are to be continued some arrangement must be made so that when hill farmers bring their cattle to market they receive decent prices for them. I cannot see this happening in the present chaotic gambling conditions of modern marketing. There should be some plan for the marketing of hill calves and store cattle just as there is in modern pig production where payment is according to quality and quantity in a business-like way. If some scheme were worked out there would be some security for people living on hill farms and it would be a viable life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hill farming in many cases will be combined with catering for tourism. When the Highland Development Board gets
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
busy it must get down to finding a plan of life for these people. I know that farmers are difficult to organise in a business-like arrangement. When Tom Johnston arranged to give farmers a guaranteed price of 1s. 1d. a dozen for eggs when they were getting 10d. a dozen from the competitive system they all entered the marketing scheme, but when the competitive system came along and offered 1s. 3d. they all broke away from the scheme and once the scheme was broken up the price went back to 10d. It is difficult to get farmers to realise that there must be some sort of organisation. Dr. Addison's marketing scheme has been the salvation of milk farmers and many others. There should be some proper arrangements for the marketing of hill cattle so that the farmers are not subjected to the vagaries of the market when they trail in and have to take their luck at the end of the day. I hope, therefore, that, one of these days, both the farmers and the Government will get down to establishing some sort of organisation to study what is happening in agriculture.

We must keep the countryside populated. If it is to be populated, people must be able to make a living in it, and, if they are to do that, we must establish an economy which makes it possible. This cannot be done in the haphazard way in which farming goes on. The plans in the Price Review which we originated way back before the war have been a great success so far as they have gone. The marketing schemes originated by us before the war have been successful so far as they have gone, but a much more comprehensive and forward-looking view must be taken to find out what is happening to farming.

Shall we be able to sell our quality beef on the Continent? This may be a great market if we can concentrate on producing high quality beef and lamb. There might be a market on the Continent for our meat just as there is for our high quality wool production and high quality Hawick woollen goods. Our production is so small that just a small consumption in all the towns on the Continent could create a boom in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can have high quality production in Scotland. One farmer told me that,

if Britain joined the Common Market, he would have a wonderful market for his spring vegetables before the Continental growers got busy with theirs. He was not afraid of the Common Market. These things must be thought out in a constructive way if we are to build on what we have and take advantage of the changes taking place not only in agriculture but in all sectors of the economy. Agriculture should be built into the new developments in a comprehensive way, with a forward looking and scientific approach, so that Scotland may prosper from both its agriculture and its industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Y. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak about agriculture in this Committee because of its great importance to the whole of Scotland, representing as it does a much larger proportion of all our industry than it does in Great Britain as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) made a strong point when he spoke about a certain scheme in Northern Ireland. The reason for the success of schemes of this kind is that Northern Ireland has a Government of its own, spending its own money in the way best suited to Northern Irish agriculture, instead of having to go to the Treasury, as we do, for every single thing and claiming a triumph whenever we extract some small concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many examples of agricultural organisation in Northern Ireland superior to what we have in Scotland and in England. This is so simply because Ulstermen deal with their own problems in a small unit. They have taken away a great deal of our Scottish potato seed trade. Another example is the way they are ahead of us in grants for silage, having realised very early on that silage was an excellent food for cattle in Northern Ireland and that they had the best climate in the world for the growing of grass though not necessarily a particularly good climate for making hay. The Department of Agriculture in Scotland ought to be looking at all these things and taking a practical view of what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have already been several references to potatoes. I have no doubt that the Scottish potato seed trade is in permanent decline and we are not just
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
experiencing a temporary situation now. There is little doubt that, with the advent of new aphid sprays, the English farmer can save himself a good deal, spraying his potatoes and carrying on Scottish seed once grown, twice grown and even thrice grown in certain situations. English farmers are now appreciating this, and we must realise in Scotland that we no longer have an automatic market. Our reputation for potato seed and the dressing of it is not very good, and the Irish have stolen a march on us here. The Government have a responsibility in this connection. They must consider, along with the trade and the farmers, what they can do to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sent to the Secretary of State a memorandum prepared by some men of experience in the potato trade, pointing out the possibilities for the export of Scottish seed potatoes. This is an extremely difficult field of action for a private organisation because the trade takes a very long time to build up. One has to take good years and bad years. There has to be a great deal of direct Government negotiation with the countries concerned, India, Egypt and even Russia, for instance; but there are immense possibilities for Scottish seed going all over the world. Basically, we still have a far better health record in Scottish seed if we handle it properly. These gentlemen have calculated that there could be an export trade of about £10 million a year once it has been built up. This could be of enormous value, and we should aim for it. Undoubtedly, we shall lose a large amount of the English seed trade, and the Department of Agriculture should be investigating the matter with vigour and seeing what sort of body ought to be set up in order to prosecute this trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must do a great deal more work also on the quality of potato ware. The Potato Marketing Board has not been very practical about this. It has been encouraging early potato growers to dress their early potatoes. In fact, it should be encouraging them to take their earlies straight off the field and put them into a stiff container for transport so that they arrive at the market with as little damage as possible. When potatoes are beaten about, not only are they marked but their quality is changed. The handling of potatoes today is quite appalling. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
go over the diggers; they are dumped into a cart; they are put over the dresser and then put into bags and dumped on a lorry; the lorryman tramps them down with his feet—which are much larger than mine—walking up and down on them—of course, the first time he gets it wrong so he walks up and down on them again; then off they go to the market, where they are dumped on the floor and some more people climb over them. It is a miracle if they reach the shops in a condition to eat at all. A much more practical outlook should be adopted in the marketing of potato ware. The Government must concern themselves with all these things. We have seen what can be done in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Secretary of State to pay far more attention to the quality of stock in Scotland and the high reputation which it enjoys. It is no good our having a general reputation for good stock if we do not take advantage of it by marketing the stuff properly. There is immense room for A.M.D.E.C. here, and money, which I understand to be spare, ought to be devoted to Scottish beef and mutton in particular, ensuring that everything possible is done to ensure proper marketing, with the meat being marked so that it can command its reward in the markets of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are short of beef and we shall be shorter still, and more attention should be paid to the maximum production of beef. The Secretary of State said that he did not want the price of barley to rise too much because it would be that much more expensive for the beef feeder. I condemn the idea of feed barley—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstood.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
tainly, the new measures the Secretary of State has been talking about, particularly with reference to the cereals authority, were word for word a Tory Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Barley beef depends entirely for its production on a low price for calves and a low price for barley. An 8 cwt. animal is produced which is killed about 4 cwt. below its potential. This is particularly the case in Friesian calves. If more animals are killed earlier, the price of calves goes up. This is what is happening to barley beef at present. With the current price of barley, it is not profitable, but people are now going over to Ayrshire calves and to that extent it would be useful. I am certain that barley should be at its proper price in Scotland in order to encourage the production of more beef from grass, which is the thing we can grow really well in Scotland. Also, the Government were mistaken in not giving more than 4s. per cwt. of beef at the last Price Review. With the way the price is going, it would not have cost them anything, and it would have given an indication that they really wanted the beef herd to expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will continue the effort to put more beef on to the hills in the form of cows. This is the only possible way we shall get more calves, and we can make proper use of the calves we have by taking them to their full weight, and in the long run, for full production, we must have more calves off the hills. Again, the experience of Northern Ireland could be looked at here. Specific subsidies should be given for increasing the herds of cattle on our hills. If we do this and use the techniques which are available to improve pastures we can put a great many cattle on the hills of Scotland. Even in the 	<i>Sun</i> newspaper this morning there is talk about making the hills of Scotland bristle with cattle. A lot of nonsense was talked after the war about how easy this was. We know now that it is not easy, but we know also that it can be done, though it will need a good deal of encouragement from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two practical points indicating ways in which the Government can do a great deal. They should set up a special body to investigate overseas markets for Scottish seed, preserving a very valuable Scottish export, particularly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
from the east of Scotland. They can do a great deal to advance the production of Scottish beef in a practical and economic way by encouraging beef off grass instead of by the use of artificially subsidised barley which produces beef which may be tender but has no taste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows that more food must be produced. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) brought this out very clearly. No longer shall we have a situation of surplus food in the world, although there may be a surplus of certain things at any one time. Scottish agriculture could be much more prosperous in present conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is wrong when he talks about this being the most prosperous and vigorous time in Scottish agriculture. In the period up to 1870, before the wretched Vanderbilts built their railways across the prairies, that was the most prosperous time. It was a time when the hills were ploughed up to a height which we are not even reaching today, a time when there was tremendous expansion in Scottish agriculture, reaching limits which we are not approaching now. This gives an indication of the sort of effort we need in Scotland if we are to have a really prosperous agriculture and help in producing the food which the world wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For example, about half a dozen speakers will today be able to put the point of view of their constituents and a score of hon. Members will go away completely frustrated and hoping to catch the Chairman's eye next year or the year after. We shall not be able to give the proper attention to Scottish agriculture till we have a permanent Scottish agricultural committee meeting regularly, taking away some of the duties of the Secretary of State and acting as a permanent committee surveying Scottish agriculture and planning for the future. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) treated us to a profound philosophic discussion of change. The first essential of change
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
is that we should change our procedure so that we can gat to grips with the problems of Scottish agriculture, not only in these casual meetings and before the Price Review, but regularly, in order that we can understand and plan and deal with the problems. Scottish agriculture is a very big matter and it demands something more than these almost incidental meetings which leave most of us with a feeling of frustration.

I am very sorry that the right hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Sir Alec Douglas-Home) is not with us. This is a curious situation. [An HON.

This important question of Scottish agriculture is vital to his constituency. Instead of being here, and giving us a clarion call, the Leader of the Opposition is missing, and doing I know not what.

The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns failed to mention at all the question which is perplexing many farmers, especially milk producers. It is the question of rent. Why do we get this avoidance of discussion of rent? Rent is a very important factor in the production of milk. The dairy farmers have to think of the rents which they will have to pay, especially if the landlord increases them. I wish the hon. Member would continue to follow the advice given by the Chairman of the Scottish Milk Marketing Board. He did not realise that the Chairman holds rather strong views about rent and that he contributes a regular weekly article to the 	<i>Scottish Farmer</i> which it would profit hon.

Let us see what he said in the 	<i>Scottish Farmer</i> of 28th May last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many rents have been doubled, some trebled and, in exceptional cases, even more. It is not unknown for rental increases to amount to the equivalent of 2d. a gallon of milk. The rent position and the question of security of tenure are bound up together and are indeed useful. I know of almost ransom values having had to be paid for the inclusion of a son in the tenancy, if ever such agreement can be bought at all."</p></blockquote>
When hon. Members opposite talk about the farmers, I notice that they never say anything about substantial increases in rent which have played their part in driving these small milk farmers out of business. The present Government have not had a great deal of time to outline their plans for the reorganisation of the farming industry in Scotland, but we are promised a five-year plan. The right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. George Brown) has promised us a five-year plan beginning in the autumn, and I hope that we shall get this plan worked out in detail for Scottish agriculture and that we shall be able to develop the long-term programme which the farmers are demanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing to do is to get clear some of the facts. One of the most outstanding facts is that of the enormous price of farms at present. In the Report of the Minister of Agriculture, there is a very coy and scanty reference to this problem. On page 65, we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department received from the Inland Revenue a record of sales of farm land involving units of 20 acres and over. This was analysed to provide information about the trend of sale prices among farms of different types, and about the numbers and types of transactions taking place."</p></blockquote>
We have just enough information there to whet our appetites. Why was not information handed on to Members of Parliament? Here is a Department of Agriculture and a Minister in the possession of a whole collection of facts about the rise in farm prices and yet the matter is dismissed casually in half a dozen lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a number of farmers are going through a difficult time some of the highest strata in Scottish farming are doing better than ever in their lives. Milk farmers in my constituency with an average of 45 to 47 cows have had their income considerably reduced through the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
last three years, under the last Government as well as under this Government. When we were discussing the Price Review, I asked that the Government should be more generous on the question of milk. The more information I have got from farmers in my constituency, the more I have believed that a case has been proved to the extent that the Government could be more generous. When I see the Government prepared to spend £10 million on Cyprus, instead of being generous to the people of Scotland, I think that there is something wrong. Something should be done to help the dairy farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite are interested in maintaining the privileged position of the landlord in Scottish farming. I have already mentioned in the House the two sheep farms in Lanarkshire which were sold for £97,000. Those farms were, of course, owned by the right hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire. That is the most outstanding example of how prices of land have soared and continue to soar. When the 	<i>Daily Express</i> published the facts about the sale of those two farms we were told that the proprietor still had 56 farms. Hon. Members opposite may have got as far as agreeing to the principle of one man, one vote, but they believe in one man, 56 farms. That is the situation. It has come about through the kind of legislation passed under a Conservative Government. We all know very well that when they were in a majority they used their position not to help the farmers but to maintain the privileged position of the landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time one finds in a certain area of Lanarkshire—I do not wish to re veal private information—that farmers are heavily in debt to the banks with over-drafts. Many smaller farmers have two enemies. The first is the bank and the second is the landlord, or 	<i>vice versa.</i> The farmers of Scotland owe the banks £56 million in overdrafts. One reason for this is that so many farmers have had to borrow in order to buy their land. A dilemma of the small farmer with a number of sons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would have no difficulty, but that I do not want to take up a greater part of the Committee's time, in finding the relevant pages and pointing them out in this Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time that the farmers are going through a difficult time, the landlords, and the banks which provide the overdraft for the farmers to buy from the landlords, are doing very well. I hope that we shall have a five-year plan for Scottish agriculture which will do something to reverse the present trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers in my constituency are very politically minded. They have passed votes of censure and expressed their opinion of the last Government in many different ways. At present, they are definitely disappointed with the last Price Review. They are calling for a long-term policy for Scottish agriculture. It is up to this Committee to press the Government till we get this plan which will result in more food being produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed at the remark of my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire about butter. What are we to do about surplus milk? An hon. Member opposite interjected, "Make it into butter", and then preceded to throw up his hands in despair that we should have to compete in the foreign market. Surely, in a world crying out for the products of milk—dried milk and butter—to say that we should curtail milk production or the production of butter and cheese when so many parts of the world are undernourished and unhealthy is the policy of defeatism and despair. I hope that, by the time we come to discuss the Estimates next year, the Price Review will be better and will give an incentive to the dairy farmers to continue milk production and show that we have progressed with the long-term programme which the intelligent farmers of Scotland are demanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish, first, to associate myself with the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State in the tribute he paid to my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). My hon. Friend made what I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
thought was the best Back Bencher's speech from the Front Bench to which I have listened for a long time and I am certain that not only the Committee but the whole House will benefit from the sheer knowledge which he will bring on the subject of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also at the outset like to comment on something else which is extremely gratifying, and that is the large attendance on both sides of the Committee. It testifies to the importance which all hon. Members attach to the value of the agricultural industry. I agree with the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) that it would be a good thing if we had more debates—perhaps one every year—on Scottish agriculture. The last one we had in the Scottish Grand Committee was in 1960. Since then and until this one it has been the choice of the Opposition as to what Estimates the Opposition wish to debate. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will chide his right hon. Friend for not having fallen in with the hon. Gentleman's wishes during the last three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all awaited with keen anticipation the speech of the right hon. Gentleman this morning, having read what were virtually the rave notices in the newspapers of his performance before the National Farmers' Union immediately after the Price Review. I am bound to say that I do not think that he will get any rave notices after his effort this morning. He spent a fair part of his speech dealing with conditions. In 1964 they had been better than previously, he said. Of course, it had been one of the outstanding harvests of this century, and even I, who had in the Scottish Office something to do with agriculture when that harvest was sown, would not lay claim on behalf of this side of the Committee to the success of the 1964 harvest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing I found extremely interesting. It came out in almost a small interpolation when the right hon. Gentleman was speaking about the Home Grown Cereals Marketing Authority. When we were considering the Bill I pressed with some energy that the levy on barley should be on the ton rather than on the acre so that those who grow barley and feed it all at home to their livestock are not charged a levy in order to support a market which they themselves do not use. The right hon. Gentleman said,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
perfectly fairly, that the Government could not manage to start this scheme this year but that there is hope that in another year the Authority may manage to tackle it. That is a good sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might have anticipated that the subject of rents would be raised, and the hon. Member for South Ayrshire raised it. No one is a greater admirer of the author whom he quoted than I am. Mr. Young is one of the outstanding agricultural journalists in the country. The figures which the hon. Gentleman quoted I would not dispute, but in the Department's publication 	<i>Scottish Agricultural Economics</i> the highest increase of rent quoted is 80 per cent. The increase in rent which has been charged, so I understand, by the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State on certain of his smallholdings has amounted to 110 per cent. and, therefore, it seems that there is no more lustful or rapacious landlord than the right hon. Gentleman himself. There again, perhaps there should be some channels of pressure going on between the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the subject of agriculture last, four years ago, it is interesting to recall, two points were made then by the right hon. Gentleman the present Secretary of State, who opened that debate on behalf of the Opposition. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not very happy in Ayrshire about the future in relation to milk".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 28th June, 1960; c. 115.]</p></blockquote>
That may have been true then, but I do not believe that in 1960 there were any processions of indignant tractor drivers going through the town of Kilmarnock. The right hon. Gentleman asked on that occasion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What part did the Secretary of State play in this? I am perfectly sure that he is letting down Scotland's agricultural needs".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 28th June, 1960; c. 109.]</p></blockquote>
I will only comment on that that if anything is needed over and above all the motions and resolutions from N.F.U. branches throughout Scotland to put the right hon. Gentleman in the dock on the charge of letting agriculture down, it was his own admission in the house, in reply to a Question of mine only five weeks ago, that he was unable to say how much
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
of the recent Price Review award will go to Scotland. If the right hon. Gentleman does not know that information I find it hard to find much reassurance of the safety and security of Scottish agriculture in his hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to give the right hon. Gentleman time, and I have very little. So I cannot give way. I am certain that the hon. Gentleman need make no attempt to make himself into a bomb-proof shelter for his right hon. Friend, who will manage perfectly well himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is broad agreement on wide aspects of agricultural policy, but it is interesting to remember certain points which the then Opposition used to say were wrong and points which presumably a dynamic Labour Government would put right. The hon. Gentleman the Minister of State year after year used to denounce the ploughing grant and gave the impression that he would do away with it. Here we are with the ploughing grant going on precisely as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State and the Secretary of State were always harping on a matter which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns, the shortage of credit and the difficulty which farmers had in getting it. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend were part authors of a booklet in 1958 on the subject, in which they said that for a medium-term credit farmers were particularly ill served. The right hon. Gentleman wrote an article in 	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> in March of last year on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to look back and remember that, when those statements were made, bank overdrafts to farmers in Scotland amounted to £55 million and cost 7 per cent. Today they stand at £71 million and cost 8 per cent. They were 9 per cent. until only a month ago. I wonder if the right hon. Gentleman would care to say what is the Government's thinking now on credit, and whether they propose to bring in a measure for stabilising or alleviating it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to find out the intentions of the Government for an important sector of Scottish agriculture and I will use the subject of the winter keep grant as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
lead in. I have asked the Minister of State—we have debated the matter in the House and he has written to me on the subject—to comment on the failure of about 5,000 farms, a not insignificant number, to get winter keep—I might even say have not applied for it—although they happen to be eligible for it. My suspicion about C farms—that is, the poorest type of farms which either do not or cannot crop—is that there are a large number of them in that category. The Minister of State, if I am not misinterpreting his reply, has maintained that the majority of the 5,000 are very small farms. He said that there may be some C farms among them, but that, by and large, they were very small units which did not find it worth while to make the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said in his letter that to give a complete answer would mean a detailed analysis of the 5,000 farms involved and he doubted if the cost and labour of doing that would be justified. Subsequently, however, the right hon. Gentleman, in a Written Answer, gave me a breakdown of those 5,000 farms, county by county. I have done a considerable study on this matter and have found that in all the cases where the percentage of non-application is high, so, too, is the percentage of C farms in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that whereas in England winter keep has now been changed to a headage basis—that is, on the number of hill ewes or cattle carried—in Scotland it remains on an acreage, graded basis; and that is the way we undoubtedly wish it to continue, except in those cases where those acreage grants are not available because the farm is either too cold, high or remote. In view of what I have said about the pattern which exists between these two approaches to the problem, I trust that the Minister will give further attention to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last Price Review there was a provision for a supplement of 2s. for a hill ewe. In the Supplementary Estimates which have just been published there is an amount for this purpose of £190,000 and this would mean, by a perfectly easy calculation, that 1,900,000 hill ewes would be involved. In fact, 2,400,000 hill ewes received the subsidy, so to speak, last year, and, therefore, there is a discrepancy of 500,000 ewes in this respect. What has happened to them? Winter
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
keep was designed to produce more beef and mutton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Secretary of State squarely and fairly: how much of these commodities do the Government want? We produce 73 per cent. of our beef consumption and 43 per cent. of our mutton and lamb consumption. Each of these commodities shows an increase in the share of the market which we have won for our own products over the last 10 years. But there is a balance of payments problem. Last year we spent £86 million on importing beef and £71 million on importing mutton and lamb—one-tenth of all our food imports, which in turn form one-third of all our imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I.C.I, has worked out, and published, that we could produce another £100 million worth of meat in the form of beef and mutton and save £50 million worth of feeding stuff imports. I ask the Government whether they have done any calculations of this kind, or whether a study is in process. What is the Government's plan? Does it fall in with the calculations of I.C.I.? I should have thought that the modest increase talked about by the Minister of State and the Minister of Agriculture is below what this country will need by 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like others, I have had to cut my remarks short, but I hope the Secretary of State will be able to deal with some of the points which hon. Members and I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend that I shall be able to deal at short notice with some of the detailed questions which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) asked, but I assure him that I will write to him about those which I do not cover. I agree with him that we have had a very good debate and that the attendance has been worthy of the subject. I thought that he was unfair to his hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) when he said that his was the best back-bench speech that he had heard delivered from the Tory Front Bench for a long time. I think that it was one of the best Front Bench speeches that I have heard for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) raised a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
point about rents. This was not unexpected. Rents play an important part in the element of costs in the agricultural community. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West should appreciate that if any difficulty arises about rents no one has more responsibility for it than the previous Administration, because they freed owners and occupiers of agricultural land from the effects of rating. They followed this up by the Agriculture Act, 1957, which made it possible for rents to be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know from where the hon. Gentleman got the figures about rents which he quoted. I have the document to which he refers, and I have read it. He will find on page 294 a very interesting table, table 198, which shows that the percentage increase in rents is as high as 301 per cent. and over in Scotland. The percentage of all farms with a rent change of 301 per cent. and over was 3 per cent. Then follows the averaging figures which show that the farmers7 new level for rent is about two-thirds higher than the old level. I do not think that there is the satisfactory position which the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) spoke about this being the most disastrous year in the history of potato farming. I hoped that he would follow up that statement by saying that the landlords in his part of the world had decided to reduce farmers' rents, showing that they were sympathetic towards their fellow human beings in this state of disaster in his constituency. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was being entirely fair. Admittedly the potato harvest was very much greater and prices were lower, but the income this year was practically the same as that for last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the great defects of hon. Members opposite. They tend not to be as objective as they could be, and should be, and do not get us into the proper frame of mind for assessing the importance of agriculture to the country, even in respect of imports. It is easy to make this point, but we cannot ignore the industrial activity of the country and the balance which has been achieved and within which we have greatly improved the position and stability of agriculture. This has ensured that it has had a growing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
share of the home market in food products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis)—he has left the Committee; he may have a perfectly good reason for doing so, but I undertook to give him an answer—asked for the figures about the home producers' share of the market in milk products. Before the war, home production amounted to 332,000 tons, which was a 33 per cent. share. In 1964–65, home production participated to the extent of 562,000 tons—a very considerable increase. The share of the home market, instead of being 33 per cent., was 44 per cent.. It is unfair to give the impression that milk products are being denied an increased share of an increased market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are having discussions with the National Farmers' Union about the important problem of trying to cut down our imports, bearing in mind our traditional reliance on help from others. These discussions will proceed because we want, as far as possible, first to save ourselves the burden of imports, and, secondly, to increase our industrial exports. This is a question of balance, and we should be very wrong to think otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East asked about action with regard to potatoes. We have already taken action. The new support arrangements will come into operation. A statement has been made about this. The facts are available. We have come to an agreement on the problems posed to us by the unions. The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that we have responded fairly quickly. It is not the first time that this controversy has arisen. I know about this problem as well as the hon. Gentleman does, because I, too, represent an area which is concerned with potatoes, as does my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. We know that problems have arisen, but this is the first time that a Government have quickly responded and made a change which became necessary because we were inevitably tied to the support arrangements which we inherited from the previous Government and which tied the Government's hands on the question of how quickly they could do something about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made this point before, and it is not exactly true. This is not the first time that a support arrangement did not coincide with demands made on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the possibility of exporting potatoes was raised by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie). I have told him that the memorandum is being studied. If it can help, we shall certainly take advantage of it. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the disappearance of the traditional Scottish export market. He is being too pessimistic. This just has not happened; it has not disappeared. The hon. Gentleman was a little muddled in many of the things he said. No doubt he was muddled on this subject. There was not the disastrous decline about which many Members spoke in the House earlier in the year. If the hon. Gentleman does not recognise this, he had better look at the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would have a look at what was being done on subsidies in other parts of Great Britain. We have a subsidy system which has worked very well. It has brought about an increase in the number of beasts on the hills. The number of cattle eligible for subsidy has doubled over a period probably of ten years. The hon. Gentleman should not under-estimate what has been achieved by our system and say that some other system is slightly better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West said about winter keep. I could not understand from what he said whether the people who were being traced were eligible or not. He drew too wide an assumption. He spoke about them being eligible but not bothering to apply, and then later he said that he felt that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
they were not eligible. It may well be that it is a bit of both. He criticised the scheme when he was on the back benches. Then he became a Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture and found that the scheme was working very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made a slight change. It is very difficult to work a dual system—it would be almost impossible to do so—? but the changes which we have made in the scheme were made with the agreement of the unions. There was full discussion, and the unions preferred the changes which we proposed, retaining the A, B and C categories with the increase in rates rather than switch, as hon. Members opposite did, to the headage payment basis in England and Wales. I am sure that the Committee would want us to march in agreement with the unions. This is what we as a Department have been doing with a considerable amount of success. The Department is not inexperienced about Scottish conditions. I pay tribute to the people in the Department who have worked well in impressing on the Government the importance of tailoring the arrangements to the needs of Scotland. We have done that, and we will continue to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the effect of mechanisation on the growing of potatoes. A study is being made of this and of the spread of gangrene in potatoes, and the extent to which this and other diseases may be caused by greater reliance on mechanical lifting. Dr. Elizabeth Gray, in Aberdeen, has been making a considerable and important study of this matter. Not only is it a question of the mechanical effects, but weather comes into this and the lightness or otherwise of the soil. This is important, because considerable loss has been experienced in the storage of potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns demanded 100 per cent. inspection of potatoes. We are looking into this, because if we can eradicate disease, or diseased potatoes themselves, we shall save very considerably—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
