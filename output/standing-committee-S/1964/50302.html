	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [25th February],</i> In page 4, line 23, after "inexpedient", to insert "in the public interest."—	<i>[Mr. Forbes Hendry.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We ended on Thursday morning with the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) indicating her views on the Amendment moved by her hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). Perhaps I could answer the discussion which arose in the later part of Thursday morning by saying that the hon. Gentleman is, of course, wanting to bring in the phrase "in the public interest" at a point where the Bill does not include it. There cannot be any quarrel with the underlying purpose of Amendments which seek to bring the public interest to the forefront, and certainly the public interest is what is really at the heart of the matter here. In the ordinary way, if the Secretary of State of the day had to take issue with the Council it would clearly be only on the basis that considerations of the public interest made it necessary, and absolutely necessary, for him to disagree with the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The doubt which arises on the Amendments, and the reason why I fear that I must resist them, is whether it is appropriate, in a statutory provision governing the powers of a Minister of the Crown, to import a reference to the public interest in the way which the hon. Member suggests. It can well be argued that such a reference is quite unnecessary and, indeed, inappropriate. To bring in the phrase "in the public interest" does not add anything effective to the con-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
tent of the Clause, and, of course, in all fields the actions of Ministers of the Crown are inevitably governed by considerations of the public interest. This must be so by the nature of the system of government in this country. It is, therefore, not only pointless, but somewhat gratuitous, to bring in an express reference to the public interest in a context such as this. I fear, therefore, that we could not accept this Amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman, having understood why this is so, may find it possible to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for the courteous way in which she has summed up this debate, and I feel she has understood very well the point I was trying to make. As a result of this debate, which has been a useful debate, I feel that this Amendment is by no means perfect in its terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I should take this opportunity to refer to what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) had to say. He said then, that the Amendment was gratuitous and offensive. He also said that it was meant to be offensive. That, of course, is not true at all. This Amendment was moved with a specific purpose and I am sorry that the hon. Member is not here. The hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) summed up the full purpose of this Amendment very well. He said:
	<br><q><p>"It was a specific point in which the hon. Gentleman was trying to make clear that the Secretary should only, as it were, interfere in those matters which did not concern teachers as a profession, but those matters which concerned their involvement in the public sector."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 25th February, 1965; c. 196.]</p></q>
That is an important point, and I think the hon. Lady understands it. I hope that between now and Report she will consider the argument, particularly as underlined by her hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West, to see if she can find a form of words which does express what I am trying to express in this Amendment, which I am the first to admit is very imperfectly worded. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> In page 4, line 41, leave out "consider any" and insert "have regard to".—	<i>[Lady Tweedsmuir.]</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 45, to leave out "indicating" and to insert "of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Mr. Brewis, for suggesting that we should also take the other two Amendment in the same sense. The purpose of these three Amendments is fairly clear. It will be observed that subsection (5) says that the Secretary of State
	<br><q><p>"shall … publish in such manner as he thinks fit a statement indicating the terms of the recommendation".</p></q>
I am suggesting to this Committee that, instead of the word "indicating", we should insert the word "of". The subsection would therefore read:
	<br><q><p>"as he thinks fit a statement of the terms of the recommendation".</p></q>
It does seem to me that that is much more definite and places a greater obligation on the Secretary of State—to publish the terms of the recommendation rather than merely to indicate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important Clause because the recommendation on this question in the Wheatley Report, as hon. Members will recall, was that, where there was a disagreement between the Teaching Council and the Secretary of State on any recommendation, and the Secretary of State therefore decided that he would not accept the recommendation, or would modify it in some form, or perhaps put forward his own recommendation, this should then be subject to the affirmative resolution of the House. Instead of that, we have the situation here where, by an ingenious device, the Secretary of State has decided not to accept the terms of the Wheatley Report about the affirmative resolution, which is the subject of a later Amendment, and suggesting instead that the Secretary of State shall be under an obligation to publish a statement indicating the terms of the recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) says
	<br><q><p>"he shall when publishing a draft of the regulations … publish … as he thinks fit a statement indicating the terms of the relevant recommendation".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
Further on it says that he shall publish
	<br><q><p>"a statement indicating any representations made by the Council".</p></q>
Therefore, I would submit to the Committee, it is very likely that the Secretary of State proposed to publish the whole terms of the recommendation, and not only an outline of it. If that is so, I would suggest it is clear that the word "of" should be substituted for the word "indicating", making it a duty upon the Secretary of State to give much clearer and definite guidance as to what is the source of the disagreement. That being so, I hope that the hon. Lady will accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lady will, perhaps, remember that on Thursday morning I indicated that there were some drafting Amendments to the Bill which we would find it possible to accept. Unfortunately, we did not proceed quickly enough for me to fulfil my promise to any large extent on Thursday. However, this is a series of Amendments which we would be quite ready to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain that there was no ulterior motive in using the word "indicating" instead of "of". The reason was simply that one had in mind that the full text of the Council's recommendations might on occasion be lengthy, and therefore it might not be very suitable to publish the whole of the recommendation. But this provision need present no real difficulties, because if the terms of the recommendation did seem likely to be unduly lengthy, then, no doubt, the Council could be asked to publish a shorter version which could be published in full. Therefor, I certainly agree that to use the word "of" is more precise than to use the word "indicating", and I am happy to accept the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you, Mr. Brewis, for agreeing to our discussing this Amendment with my next one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment seeks to remedy a fundamental weakness in a Bill which I would say is otherwise an excellent and valuable piece of legislation. Indeed, to have to move this Amendment is also a disappointment, particularly when I remember the discussion of the earlier Amendments and the way in which the Under-Secretary of State herself time and again, in dealing with Amendments, said that we must not seek to circumscribe the powers of the Council, we must not narrow its remit; we must have it as broad and effective as possible. Yet when it comes to a fundamental question of power, the hon. Lady hesitates, as, indeed, the Government appear to be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have used the word "fundamental" twice, but I make no apology for that, because the nub of the Bill lies in the relationship between the Council and the Secretary of State. That is the vital part of the Bill. The way in which we are prepared to give teachers a degree of self-determination with regard to the regulations dealing with qualifications for entry into their profession indicates the degree to which we are prepared to accept the real intent of the Wheatley Committee. To regulate the terms of entry into the teaching profession is precisely and exactly what the teachers want, and the fact that this Amendment is necessary shows that we are not yet providing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four ways in which we can express the relationship between the Sec-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
retary of State and the Council. First, we can say that the Secretary of State should be given a power to accept the recommendations of the Council. In other words, if the Council recommends, the Secretary of State will accept. Secondly, we can say that the Secretary of State should be given power to accept, but also given power to veto or reject. Extending it further, we can say that he should be given power to accept or reject, and also, to a limited degree, to initiate. Lastly, we can say that he should be given power to accept, to reject, or to initiate as he wills, which is what the Bill says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of the debate of the consideration of the Principle of the Bill, the Secretary of State referred to what Lord Wheatley had said. He said:
	<br><q><p>"We therefore had knowledge and experience, men who … started with pre-conceived ideas about the problem, and yet every one of whom moved from those pre-conceived ideas towards general agreement. The degree of unanimity which was reached, bearing in mind the nature of the body, is a tribute in itself to their realism and to Lord Wheatley in guiding the Committee."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 2nd February, 1965, c. 5.]</p></q>
I agree with the right hon. Gentleman paying tribute to Lord Wheatley's guiding the Committee, but if by emphasising that the Secretary of State intended to suggest that the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee were unanimous, I think that he was being a little over-optimistic, because every committee must inevitably arise at a compromise by balancing the competing factions, and if we ask the teachers what they really want, we shall find that they want the Council to control entry, and that the Secretary of State should not be able to act in defiance of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley did not recommend this. He did not recommend that the Secretary of State should be empowered merely to accept recommendations of the Council. He did not even recommend that the Secretary of State should merely be confined to having the power of veto. What he said was that if this Council is to be successful in any situation of crisis—and it is a situation of crisis about which we have to think—it is necessary for a strong curb to be placed on the freedom of the Secretary of State to initiate regulations at will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
All this is outlined in Chapter 8 of the Wheatley Committee Report, and I want to quote two paragraphs from it because I feel that they express the argument more concisely and clearly than I am capable of doing. Paragraph 97 says:
	<br><q><p>"Nevertheless, we think that it would be impossible and, indeed, wholly unreasonable to require the Secretary of State to exercise his ultimate responsibility and answer in Parliament for the supply of teachers if at the same time the standards of entry to the profession were completely outwith his jurisdiction and in the hands of a professional body for which he had no responsibility and over which he had no authority. We consider, therefore, that he must retain a say in matters concerning the standards of entry to teacher-training."</p></q>
The significant phrase there is, "retain a say". Wheatley did not express it as his opinion that the Secretary of State should retain complete control of the initiation of regulations if it were necessary, but that he should retain a say, which is not anything like so strong, and as a means of curbing the power of the Secretary of State he suggested the affirmative resolution procedure, with which the Amendment is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what he thinks the Wheatley Committee had in mind when it used the words, "retain a say"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that he should in the first place retain the right to reject recommendations brought forward by the Council and, secondly, that he should continue to have the power to initiate regulations, but that this power should be strictly limited. It is with the limitation of these powers that I am concerned, and indeed it was the method of restricting and limiting these powers through the affirmative resolution procedure with which Wheatley dealt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making his case very well, but the word "say" is the wrong word to use in this context, because, as he knows, one can have a big say, or a little say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or no say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context, it is difficult to know whether it is a big say or a little say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The capacity of hon. Gentlemen opposite to take words and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
juggle with them often alarms me. The Report refers to "a say". I think that the meaning is clear, unless one is of the cast of mind which demands that one takes every word and dissects it. I rather suspect that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) is inclined to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose now to read from paragraph 104 of the Report which sums up the position much more clearly than I could. It says:
	<br><q><p>"We expect that in the great majority of cases the Secretary of State will find no difficulty in accepting and implementing recommendations made by the kind of Council we have in mind."—</p></q>
That is important—
	<br><q><p>"We recommend that where he does so he should implement the recommendations in the normal way through Statutory Regulations which would be subject to the negative resolution procedure … But in order to ensure the fullest opportunity for public discussion of any matter where the Secretary of State finds himself unable, for reasons of Government policy or otherwise, to accept and to act on a recommendation of the Council or wishes to initiate any matter—</p></q>
we must consider the possibility of such a situation arising—
	<br><q><p>"where the Council declined to make any recommendation to meet a problem posed by him, we recommend that, in the event of disagreement between the Council and the Secretary of State, the latter should proceed by Regulations subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This would have two main results. It would ensure Parliamentary discussion of the matter in question, for Ministers would require to state and defend their policy twice, in moving in each of the Houses of Parliament the approval of the Regulations. Under the more normal negative resolution procedure, Regulations are debated only if Members of Parliament choose to table a motion for their annulment. Secondly, it would not be possible for the Regulations to come into operation until they had been discussed and approved by both Houses of Parliament. Under the negative procedure they normally come into operation almost immediately on being made and before they can be discussed in Parliament, and as a result there is often a feeling that they constitute a 	<i>fait accompli,</i> with little chance of the policy being reversed once it has been introduced."</p></q>
If we have a situation in which the Secretary of State introduces regulations which are opposed by the Council, it will undermine a great deal of the hope, trust and expectation which the mere setting up of the Council has created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, whom I have quoted, dealt with this during his speech
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
on 2nd February. This is, after all, the only point on which the Government's proposed legislation differs from the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee. The Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"We have not entirely followed the Wheatley Committee in this respect."</p></q>
That is putting it very mildly. He went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding here. It may be that Lord Wheatley had been too long away from this House."</p></q>
I think that that was a surprising thing to say. Surely the Secretary of State is not suggesting that Lord Wheatley, who has had long experience in Parliament, would make a serious recommendation without being in touch with what is going on in the House? The Secretary of State went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"Regulations and orders are legislation, delegated legislation, but they certainly do not make the same demands on the time of the House of Commons as does other legislation."</p></q>
This is the second argument which the Secretary of State is adducing, that if we adopt the affirmative resolution procedure, there will be continual pressure on the time of the House of Commons in the event of disagreement.
	<br><q><p>"They are very much easier to introduce and to get through because of that fact."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 2nd February, 1965; cc. 17–18.]</p></q>
Is that to be the criterion? What will the teachers say? The Secretary of State says that he will not accept the affirmative resolution procedure, which seeks to have the matter aired properly in the Houses of Parliament, because the negative procedure is much easier to introduce and to get through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are concerned with the old question of the battle of the Legislature against the Executive—something about which the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) spoke very forcefully on the second day of the debate on the consideration of principle, which I unfortunately missed, but the Report of which I read. I suggest that the Council is not likely to be any the more pleased to find that it is under the domination of the dominie from Kilmarnock than it was when it was under the domination of his predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This question was returned to by the Under-Secretary of State in her speech at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
the end of the debate on the consideration of principle. Strangely enough, she did not follow her right hon. Friend's argument. It would appear that between the Tuesday and the Thursday someone had been delving about in the dungeons of Dover House and had unearthed that most formidable of obstacles, a constitutional objection. I found it extremely alarming, listening to the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) to note the way in which he took words of which I thought I knew the meaning and proved that they meant the exact opposite. But for a back bencher it is even more alarming to find oneself faced with a constitutional objection. The hon. Lady said in her speech on the consideration of principle:
	<br><q><p>"There is a real constitutional and Parliamentary difficulty about that arrangement."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 4th February, 1965; c. 102.]</p></q>
I thought that the hon. Member for West Lothian had dealt adequately with the constitutional objection. The Educational Institute of Scotland took advice on the question, and I believe that that advice has been circulated to all hon. Members. Since it is brief, I would like to read it, because it sums up succinctly the opinion of a Queen's Counsel of Edinburgh that there is no constitutional objection to this method of approving statutory orders. He said:
	<br><q><p>"I have been asked to consider whether there is any constitutional objection to the adoption by Parliament of the negative resolution procedure for statutory regulations when the Secretary of State and the Council are in agreement, and the affirmative resolution procedure when the Secretary of State and the Council are in disagreement. In my opinion there is none. It is for Parliament to determine which procedure shall be applied."</p></q>
I hope that it will so determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"If Parliament decides in advance that the negative resolution procedure will be appropriate for these regulations in a given and defined state of fact: and that the affirmative resolution procedure will be appropriate for these regulations in a different and defined state of fact, there is no constitutional reason why it should not so provide in the Bill. By so providing Parliament will surrender none of its power to determine its own procedure."</p></q>
We are concerned with what will happen if the Secretary of State and the Council are in disagreement. We are concerned how the Council which we are setting up to improve relations in the teaching profession and improve its status will act under the pressure of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
crisis. The test of an organisation of any kind is how it reacts under pressure. What sort of regulations might the Secretary of State wish to introduce with which the Council would disagree?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me once more remind the Committee of what the Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"I do not foresee disagreement arising very often—I hope not at all."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 2nd February, 1965; c. 18.]</p></q>
I wonder, therefore, what he is worrying about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a suspicion in the minds of teachers that the reason why the Secretary of State is reluctant to accept the affirmative resolution procedure, and why the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) for the Opposition also sits quietly is that both have the executive mentality. One now represents the Government, and the other recently did so, and both right hon. Gentlemen are considering the question with the same outlook, and considering the possibility of the Secretary of State's introducing dilution into the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the basic question and the basic suspicion which will remain in the minds of teachers. As the hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) has said many times, this is not a teachers' council. The Secretary of State has appointed nominees upon it. It is not likely to be an irresponsible body, which will produce suggestions such as were envisaged in a most amusing fashion by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). It will not seek capriciously to disagree. But if the Secretary of State proposes to dilute the qualifications when the Council is set up to safeguard those qualifications, so that, at the end of the day, the teachers can rightly say, "Ross is still boss", we shall have lost a great opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in a slight difficulty in answering the point made by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) because his whole case was based upon the premise that he had put down a rather different Amendment. He did not argue the case for his Amendment; he argued the case for implementing in the Bill the Wheatley
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
recommendation whereby the procedure to be adopted in the House in considering regulations would vary according to what had happened outside—according to whether or not there was disagreement between the Secretary of State and the Council. This is not what the Amendment seeks to do. It substitutes for the negative procedure the affirmative procedure for all regulations made under this Clause, that is to say, for all regulations made in this field. The hon. Gentleman did not argue the case for that. He argued pro-Wheatley. Therefore, in part I want to explain why we could not accept the Wheatley recommendation as it stands and then, faced with the fact that this was impracticable, why we decided on the negative as against the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before proceeding to his argument of substance I must refer to his comments in the debate at Second Reading. He rather misinterpreted what my right hon. Friend said. If he refers to column 18 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of that debate he will find that, in pointing out that regulations were very much easier to introduce and to get through, my right hon. Friend was making a comparison between regulations, that is to say delegated legislation, and other legislation, that is to say, Bills. Of course it is the case that regulations which are dealt with by the affirmative or the negative procedure take less time to be discussed by the House than does a Bill. That is the point which my right hon. Friend was making, on which I am sure there will be wholehearted agreement by all hon. Members. There can be no question of any apparent difference of view between my right hon. Friend and myself on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I shall not be thought too brusque in using the expression, I also want to dispose of the note from the counsel for the E.I.S. to which the hon. Member referred. I was gratified to see that a distinguished counsel had sustained the point that I made in replying to the debate at Second Reading. If the Committee will refer to my speech on that occasion they will see that I said:
	<br><q><p>"If the Wheatley recommendation were carried out as it stands, it would mean that the form of Parliamentary procedure to be used on a particular occasion would be dependent on whether or not an outside body agreed or disagreed with the Government. That would raise a rather new Parliamentary and constitutional point which is properly a question for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
this Committee and the House to decide. It is a Parliamentary point."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 4th February, 1965, c. 103.]</p></q>
This is sustained in counsel's opinion. He says that it is for Parliament to determine which procedure shall be applied. There is no disagreement between myself and counsel for the E.I.S. We agree that it is a Parliamentary point, and that it must be discussed on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now take the Amendment, and not the hon. Member's argument. Many regulations are made under this Clause. The hon. Member will know, if he studies last week's Vote, that during 1964 there were 2,070 Statutory Instruments of this kind, and that many of them referred to education. Let me give some examples. In the comparatively recent past we have had amendments to the Regulations for the Preliminary Education, Training and Certificate of Teachers for Various Grades of Schools (Scotland) 1931, which involve a number of regulations coming before the House. We have had amendments relating to allowing colleges of education to admit to the three-year course for primary teachers, girls who narrowly failed to secure one of the five prescribed subjects for entry, provided the failure was not in English. We have had amending Regulations introducing the subject of speech and drama in a teacher training course which might be offered a teacher's technical certificate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady say that the regulations that she is quoting are such that they would find strong opposition from the Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed not. That is the point I am trying to make. Under the terms of the Amendment every such regulation of this kind, in respect of which there would be very little possibility of disagreement, would be subject to the affirmative procedure. That is why I say that the hon. Member perhaps misunderstood what his Amendment involves. It involves all these minor matters being made subject to the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amongst these minor matters there may be certain ones in respect of which, for one reason or another, a regulation or a new amendment as proposed by the Secretary of State raises some discussion, and it might be thought proper that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
House should discuss the question. The implication of the hon. Member's argument is that in some way or other matters subject to the negative procedure would have little opportunity of being discussed. That is not so. The only difference between the affirmative and negative procedures is the time allowed for debate in the House, and the fact that under the negative procedure it is the task of an hon. Member to put down a Prayer to annul regulations, and to find 40 people who are prepared to support a discussion of the matter. It is really a difference in the time scale. There are 1½ hours for the negative procedure and an unlimited time—commencing after 10 o'clock—for the affirmative procedure. It is not as though we are faced with the alternative between a whole day's debate beginning at 3.30 p.m., continuing through the evening, and a one and half hour's debate late at night. We must consider the way in which the House of Commons runs these matters. We have the clear possibility that if there is a reason for debating certain of the regulations—and under the Bill they could be minor or major regulations—the House has the opportunity to discuss them, but has a little less time to do so than if it were done under the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of considerable importance because from time to time the House has looked at the arrangements for the negative and affirmative procedures and the conditions under which one or the other should be used. The last occasion was in 1952 and 1953 when there was a Select Committee on Delegated Legislation. The hon. Member for Inverness mentioned that perhaps my right hon. Friend had been a little critical of the Wheatley Report and had said that Lord Wheatley had been a long time away from the House of Commons. I think that he meant that in the last fifteen years there have been a number of changes in the way the House has dealt with these things and that the 1952–53 Select Committee, which analysed the position, was published only at the point when Lord Wheatley left the House. I think I am correct in saying that he left in 1954, so a lot has gone in since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In evidence to the Select Committee was given an analysis of the kind of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
Legislation on which it would be expected that the affirmative procedure would relate to regulations under a Measure. The first instance—and I am paraphrasing paragraph 75 of the Report of the Select Committee—is where powers were given which when exercised, would substantially affect the provisions of an Act whether by altering, increasing or changing its extent, its duration or otherwise. Such is not the nature of the Bill before the Committee. The second category was comprised of powers to impose financial charges. This is not a Bill in that category. The third consisted of cases of skeleton powers where the Act fixes the purposes and leaves a substantial amount to be dealt with by subordinate legislation. This is not that kind of Bill, either. The kind specified on the occasion of the publication of the Report I am mentioning was the Development Council Order made under the 1947 Act where one was dealing with a Measure which stated, in effect, that a Development Council Order could be set up for any industry. That does not relate to the type of Bill before the Committee, which deals with educational provisions and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have endeavoured to show that the understanding of the hon. Member for Inverness—of where it is and is not suitable to have the affirmative procedure as against the negative procedure for all the regulations emanating from a Measure—has led him to a false conclusion as to the arrangements under a Bill of this kind. On the other hand, the Wheatley recommendation on procedure provides in the event of a disagreement between a Minister of the Crown and a non-Parliamentary body for the latter body being allowed to determine what happens inside the House of Commons. In our view this is not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having found ourselves unable to accept the Wheatley recommendation as it stands, and having come to that conclusion on good grounds, and being faced with the choice between the negative and affirmative procedure for every regulation under the Bill, we have felt it correct to say that it should be done by the negative procedure. We know that this will give ample opportunity for any disagreement on any regulation proposed between the Secretary of State and the Teaching
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
Council to be fully explored in the same way as regulations are explored now under the negative procedure, the only substantial difference being the time scale allowed for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial concession has been made to the opinion among teachers; that is embodied in subsection (7), the abandonment of provisional regulations. This should wholly convince the teaching profession that the Government are very anxious indeed to meet the points which it puts on this issue—to meet its point that it would not wish the Secretary of State to have powers which would seem to by-pass the duties and responsibilities of the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness will recall that the procedure between 1946 and 1962—and embodied again in the 1962 Act—has always been that first the Secretary of State made regulations in draft, then he allowed 40 days for discussion, then he had recourse to representations made to him, then he made the regulations, then he laid them before Parliament and then, under the negative procedure, they were subject to annulment. However, Section 144 of the 1962 Act provided that in cases of urgency, where the Secretary of State himself defined urgency, he could make provisional regulations which would take immediate effect, without representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley Report said that recourse to provisional regulations should be abandoned because they were disliked by the profession. That has been done, and provisional regulations have been abandoned in the Clause. We have done everything possible to meet the views of the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what the hon. Member for Inverness has been seeking to do, for he has been seeking to convey the concern of the back bencher or person outside Parliament that the executive powers of the Government should not be allowed to override the real responsibilities which the Teaching Council will have. I assure him that only after the most careful examination of the Parliamentary processes of dealing with these methods—of comparing the powers under the Bill before us and other Measures which concern delegated legislation, where it has been thought fit to have the one procedure as against the other—have we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
come to the conclusion that it would not be correct for us to embody in the Bill a provision that all the regulations should be subject to the affirmative procedure. I hope that I have convinced the hon. Gentleman that only after the greatest thought have we come to this view. We think that we are sustained in this logical argument by well-based Parliamentary precedent, and I hope that, as a result of what I have said, he will give careful thought to our point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Lady on the points she has raised, but I wish to draw her attention to another point concerning the wording of the Clause, for we find in subsection (7):
	<br><q><p>"Section 144 of the Act of 1962 (except subsection (3) thereof) shall apply …"</p></q>
That is quite wrong. I have submitted to the Committee before that we should not pass legislation which continually refers to other Acts, the contents of which could well be incorporated in the Bill under discussion. I have looked up Section 144 of the 1962 Act. It is not very long. Could not it be included in the Clause? It would make life much easier for any practising lawyer, and, if we are giving teachers a new charter I hope that it will be made as logical and as easily to be understood as possible. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Lady will look at this and similar instances in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look at that point. I appreciate that it is worth looking into and I will see whether it is possible to include it in a Schedule to the Bill, if not in the actual wording of the part of the Bill with which the hon. Gentleman is concerned, for to do that would make the Clause too long. I cannot comment further on the point because it had not occurred to me before. Since subsection (3) will be going out and there will be subsections (1), (2), (4) and (5) of the Section I will consider the point between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took great interest in the excellent speech of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), and have a good deal of sympathy with the argument he adduced, but one thing is troubling me. He based his case on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
positive action which may be taken by the Secretary of State namely, that the Secretary of State may, in a disagreement, with the Teaching Council, introduce regulations with which the Council is not in agreement. It is interesting to note that subsection (5) states:
	<br><q><p>"If the Secretary of State refuses to make regulations … giving effect to a relevant recommendation he shall … publish in such manner as he thinks fit a statement indicating the terms of the recommendation and his reasons for refusing to make regulations giving effect to it."</p></q>
It would seem that the Amendment before the Committee would not be in any way concerned with that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What if the Secretary of State refused to publish the regulations? It would be interesting to know what would happen if the Secretary of State refused to publish those details. I imagine that this might be far more important and could give rise to a more fundamental divergence of opinion than the case of regulations being introduced which were not fully in accord with a decision arrived at by the Teaching Council. This would seem a more fundamental point than that raised by the hon. Member for Inverness, who used the word "fundamental" more than once, and I hope that my hon. Friend will comment on it. There could be a greater clash if Mr. Ross avoids exercising his powers. I was rather concerned when the hon. Member for Inverness spoke about perpetuity and said that Mr. Ross might be there—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness will agree that my hon. Friend has made out a good case for us to proceed in conformity with the practice of the House. She showed clearly the difficulties which could arise if the Amendment were accepted. She also pointed out the safeguards which exist under the proposed methods of implementing the Bill and how any interested party is able to raise any regulation which is considered to be offensive. In such circumstances, such a regulation could be prayed against in the usual way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree largely with the remarks of my hon. Friend, and while I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) I hope that the Committee will feel satisfied with my hon. Friend's reply, which I thought covered the position as effectively as it is possible to cover it under the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness hinted at the possibility of dilution taking place. This has always been a dread in the profession. The aim of the Bill is to give the profession greater control in maintaining its dignity and the quality of its entrants by insisting on registration. Nevertheless, there is still great residual power in the hands of the Secretary of State. I, for one, want to see the Secretary of State with the power that he has, because he is immediately subject to the surveillance and criticism of Parliament. That is essential, in my view, and it must be reconciled with the increased power being given to the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What disturbs me even more than Clause 7 is a Clause which went through without receiving perhaps the comment that it merited. Although we may restrain and have control over dilution at the point of registration, I was not quite sure that it was made clear during our proceedings on Clause 5 that we have any control over the problem of dilution at the point of entry into colleges of education. At university level dilution will not occur, but on my reading of Clause 5 there is no guarantee that the Council will have any say about the quality of entrants to colleges of education. I am afraid from what I hear of the schools—Mr. Brewis, I am just finishing on this matter; I shall be out of order for only a second—that there is the chance that the entry qualification might, to meet certain circumstances, be adjusted at the college of education so as to keep up the numbers. I merely state that danger and then sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, there has not been much support for the Amendment. If something can be said for the Amendment, it is that it is perhaps the most professional looking Amendment on the Notice Paper, because it deals with the technical position in some detail. That is why I was rather surprised that the speech made by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) did not relate specifically to the Amendment. On the other hand, the hon. Gentleman did us a service by drawing attention to the fact that the Bill has departed in some major respects from the recommendations made in the Wheatley Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I was surprised at two statements the hon. Gentleman made. He said, first, that Wheatley had said that the Secretary of State should still have the right to initiate regulations. In fact, my reading of the Wheatley Report, particularly paragraph 103, leads me to a completely different conclusion, because Wheatley makes it clear that he considers that there should be a major change in the balance of power and that the Secretary of State should not have the right to initiate regulations, although this should not debar him
	<br><q><p>"from drawing problems to the attention of the Council and inviting it to consider them and recommend on necessary courses of action."</p></q>
In fact, we have not got the departure to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but another major departure from the Wheatley Report. These are not minor matters. These are major areas of difference and departure. However, I believe that it would be wrong for the Government to accept the Amendment, because it could make life quite impossible for them and make the Parliamentary procedures relating to the Bill very difficult to bring into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman advanced two reasons for introducing the Amendment. One was simply that this was what the teachers want, which was very interesting. The hon. Gentleman's second reason was a more detailed one, that if the Amendment were accepted it would bring in some kind of curb on the Secretary of State in trying to resist recommendations made by the Council. This is a positively valid argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said was a curb on the Secretary of State in himself initiating regulations, not in vetoing suggestions coming from the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow what the hon. Gentleman is now saying, but, with respect, that is not what I understood him to say when he advanced his argument. The objection which the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
Gentleman had was that, if we do not have this kind of procedure, it will he far too easy for the Secretary of State to overturn recommendations made by the Council. This is understandable. It means that individual Members of Parliament will have to exercise constant vigilance to see what recommendations are coming forward and what regulations are being laid before Parliament so as to make sure that nothing slips through. I believe that we can assume that individual Members of Parliament, perhaps of all parties, will not be allowed to forget or not to notice regulations of this sort coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, one thing which is perhaps quite worrying is that it will mean that the House of Commons will have only 1½ hours to discuss what might be a major issue of education policy. Under the negative resolution procedure we shall have only 1½ hours to discuss in Parliament what could be a very major issue in education. This is one of the real supporting arguments which I can see for the Amendment. If there is to be a major departure of this sort, the Government should try so far as possible to give as much time as can be given to discuss it. In particular, they should ensure that it does not have to be discussed late at night, as these matters have to be under the present arrangements. This is something which the Government could put right themselves. If there were a major departure of policy, perhaps time could be allowed for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) made quite clear what the major objection is to the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Inverness in support of the Amendment. Despite all the safeguards contained in the Amendment and despite the fact that this would mean a great deal of Parliamentary time being given up for items on which there might not be any disagreement, it does not cover the major objection which the Council may have—that is, the Secretary of State refusing to take any action on certain proposals made by the Council. If the Secretary of State refuses to take any action, no regulations are laid before Parliament. Although the hon. Member for Inverness envisaged many circumstances in which there might be disagreement, it is clear from our experience that the major area
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
of disagreement will be in cases where the Secretary of State is refusing to act on representations made by the Council. Despite all the safeguards provided for in the Amendments, that will not cover this situation. This situation would in fact constitute the main area of disagreement. Although this covers a wide field, it does not in any way completely cover the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that any Government would be extremely reluctant, except in the cases to which the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary referred, to allow the affirmative resolution procedure to operate over a wide field of regulations, because this could make government very difficult indeed. It could mean a large number of late night Sittings. It could be used for harrying the Government out of office. The time may well come when my right hon. and hon. Friends will wish to harry the Government out of office, but if we want to do so I suggest that this is not the appropriate way to do so. It would also mean a great deal of Parliamentary time being taken up with matters on which there will be little disagreement between anyone in the whole of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, I believe that it would be very wrong indeed for us to accept the Amendment, but I hope that we can receive an assurance from the Government that, if by way of regulations they intend to introduce a major change of policy or to reject a major recommendation made by the Council, they will accept an obligation to allow some Parliamentary time for discussion, because, although regulations come forward under delegated powers, it is more than likely that one of these regulations could cover a major change of policy. The hon. Member for Inverness referred to one such change which might come before us. If something of that nature or another major issue were to come forward, adequate time should be allowed for discussion. If we receive an assurance to this effect, I, for one, would be quite happy. I should certainly be most unhappy if the Amendment were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can bring this discussion to a close by simply replying to one or two of the points which have been made. First, on the question of the Secretary of State's initiative, the Clause provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations on his own initiative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
—that is to say, otherwise than on the basis of recommendations by the Council. This is embodied in the Bill, as, indeed, it was recommended by Wheatley. To clear away any misunderstanding I point out that paragraph 104 of the Wheatley Report says this in regard to where the Secretary of State was accepting and implementing recommendations by the Council—in other words, where there was agreement between them:
	<br><q><p>"We recommend that where he does so he should implement the recommendations in the normal way through statutory Regulations which would be subject to the negative resolution procedure."</p></q>
I say this merely to emphasise that it was far from the minds of the Wheatley Committee to suggest that the affirmative procedure embodied in the Amendment should be the normal practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked what would happen if there were to be a substantial disagreement between the Council and the Secretary of State and if it were thought desirable that there should be a lengthier debate than is normally allowed on the negative resolution procedure. The point here is that, if it were a matter of this kind, arrangements would clearly be made, one would think, through the usual channels for a debate to take place on this kind of subject—on a Supply Motion, or something of that kind. One is envisaging here—certainly the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) is envisaging—a really substantial disagreement, which one would not at this moment expect to arise. I think that there is very little possibility that this would occur, but, should it do so, it would clearly be a matter of such moment that it might be perfectly appropriate to arrange for a debate in the House on the issues associated with the regulations, as against a debate on the regulations themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the question of the time of night at which debates on regulations take place and on the time scale, may I refer the Committee to the Third Report from the Select Committee on Procedure, Session 1962–63? The Committee discussed this whole question and the difficulties which tended to arise because of the limitations of debate late at night. The Committee suggested that the House of Commons might like to refer to the Select Committee on Procedure at a later
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
date, with a wide Order of Reference, all the matters associated with this problem. Again, this is a question of the general procedure of the House and the arrangements the House itself may decide to make to cover difficulties of this kind arising in debates on regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think one can probably best sum up the discussion by saying that there seems to be general agreement on both sides of the Committee that the Amendment would be neither practicable nor desirable. I recognise that by moving the Amendment the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) was rightly seeking to get a very full explanation from the Government of why it was necessary to come to the view we have taken.

I do not know that I would go so far as to say that I would completely agree with all her arguments, by any means, but I would certainly concede that she is correct in saying that the Amendment is probably unsatisfactorily phrased for what it is intended to achieve. As she has said, we have had a long discussion; and, indeed, much of what has been said this morning will be remembered and regarded as an assurance by the teaching profession. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment, with permission, of course, from the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), who also signed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) should seek to withdraw this excellent Amendment. I think he has been unwittingly, perhaps, misled by the hon. Lady in her explanations about the undesirability of this procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of this Committee's deliberations I have been honoured with various zoological descriptions. I have been described as a rogue elephant and I have been described as an old fox. I do not know under which of these designations I am making my present speech—possibly under both—but I have been a Member of the House long enough to know that there is very little substance in the description of the difficulties brought about by the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady well knows, it is purely a matter of wording the Motion on the Paper. In the one case, the Secretary of State puts down a Motion that the regulation made should be approved, and, in the other case, the initiative is on the part of an hon. Member. If the Secretary of State puts down a Motion and if there is no objection, as the hon. Lady well knows as a result of experience, it can go through on the nod and there is no Parliamentary time whatsoever wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two very important sides to this. The first is that the onus is on the Secretary of State to justify his action. If he is proposing to run in the face of this very responsible Council, then it is his duty, if we are using the affirmative procedure, to come along and say why he is doing it. It seems to me that, if he does not do that, then he is not standing up to his responsibilities and explaining to the House of Commons this most extraordinary action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Wheatley in his Report was perfectly clear on this subject, and he explained very well why this should be done. This, indeed, is in line with the whole tenor of my arguments throughout this Committee that the responsibility for initiating these regulations should be with the Council, and it should be a very exceptional course for the Secretary of State to do otherwise. As Lord Wheatley puts it, the Secretary of State should act, where he finds himself unable, for reasons of Government policy or otherwise, to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
accept and act upon a recommendation of the Council. In other words, his reason for doing this must be extrinsic to the profession itself, and must be for a matter of Government policy. A matter for Government policy is a matter for debate in the House of Commons and not somewhere outside, such as in the newspapers or anywhere else. It does seem to me that the appropriate procedure in the event of a disagreement is, as Lord Wheatley said, the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Wheatley did not go to the length of this Amendment suggested by the hon. Member for Inverness. He suggested another alternative, as the hon. Member very rightly said in his speech. As the hon. Lady knows, there is nothing whatever in this world to prevent her from putting down on Report an Amendment modifying this, and providing for the negative procedure or the affirmative procedure on the lines of Lord Wheatley's Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go to the length of saying that, if she were to put down some Amendment on Report providing that in the event of any disagreement the negative procedure should apply I should be the very first person to support her in that, but I am afraid that I can see no reason after this debate to depart from Lord Wheatley's considered recommendation, and I thoroughly approve of the Amendment put down by the hon. Member for Inverness with my support. For these reasons, I am very much afraid that I cannot agree to the withdrawal of this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can best answer the noble Lady by saying that there is no real departure in this Clause from the accepted position at the moment. The purpose of the Clause is to require the Teaching Council, as she says, to draw up a statement of principles on which they will be prepared to consider applications For exceptional admission to the register; that is, applications from individuals who have, for example, trained outside Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lady will remember that I gave her some figures earlier about the number who have been trained outside Scotland and accepted for the teaching profession in Scotland during the last five years. Similar provisions to those in the Clause exist at present under the Training Authorities (Scotland) Regulations, 1958, which provide for a statement of principles by the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers in regard to exceptional certification by the Secretary of State of individuals educated and trained outside the normal Scottish pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would expect the Teaching Council in due course to draw up a statement one lines comparable to the memorandum on the exceptional award of teaching qualifications, which was published by the Scottish Council in November, 1962. This memorandum sets out the general principles on which cases fall to be considered. It identifies the essential elements of education, training and experience which the Council looks for both individually and in combination. So I can assure the noble Lady that the Clause is no new departure, and that one would expect the Teaching Council to follow broadly the same lines as the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers does at the moment in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause broadly follows the provisions which have been made in similar legislation for other professional persons.

It does bear a reasonable relation to the provisions in other legislation for control of entry to other professions, and to fraudulent representations in relation to that. What I have said almost completely answers the point which the noble Lady has made. There are precedents, and it is quite clear that if we are having legislation which provides for entry to the profession then it is of tremendous importance to have in that legislation a Clause which would impose penalties for people who made fraudulent representations, who misrepresented their qualifications, and misrepresented anything which might cause them illegally to be considered for entry to a profession which they were not entitled to be in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
The purpose of moving this Amendment is partly to find out what is in the hon. Lady's mind about the composition of these two Committees. We also thought it was very desirable that some sort of instruction ought to be given to the Teaching Council as to the size of these Committees. It seems to me, particularly in the case of the Investigating Committee, that the Committees should be kept very small. We have here quite a large Council and it seems to me that it would be highly inappropriate if a large number of persons were on this Investigating Committee. My experience in the legal profession, is that a great many complaints, most of which are completely frivolous, are made against members of the profession. The great majority of complaints against members of the profession are so minor and so trivial that they can be dealt with out of hand by a small committee. On the other hand, the more serious cases can be better investigated by a small committee than by a large one, and it is for that reason that my right hon. Friend and myself have put down this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other half of the Amendment is concerned with the fact that these Committees should be composed of members of the Council, and the Bill as it is at present drafted does not say that. It seems to me that it is appropriate that these Committees, particularly the Investigating Committee, should consist entirely of members of the Council. After all, the Investigating Committee is given very wide powers to probe into the background of a teacher and things of that sort, and it would seem to me intolerable if this Committee were to consist of people imported for the purpose of making investigations. I hope that the hon. Lady will be able to satisfy us on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that in his reference to the second part of the Amendment the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to his question—and I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has put down this Amendment in order to explore the position—is that the provision here follows broadly the form
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
for similar committees which are being set up or have been set up under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act, 1960. Under this Act the various professional boards of radiographers, physiotherapists and so on are set up. In the 1960 Act there is no provision regarding the number of members. There is, of course, provision in the Medical Act, 1956—and the hon. Gentleman may have referred to this—whereby the Disciplinary Committee under that Act shall consist of the President and 18 other members of the General Medical Council, but there is no provision made in the Act as to the membership for their Penal Cases Committee, which is the preliminary investigating body under the Medical Act, which corresponds to the Investigating Committee under this Act. The membership is left to be determined in rules which will be made by the Disciplinary Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be happy to consider between now and Report the number of members on the Committees. There seems to be no necessity for saying that they should be members of the Council. There seems to be no reason for providing that the discretion of the Council should be limited as to the membership of the Investigating and Disciplinary Committees, otherwise than is provided for in subsection (4,	<i>a</i>) in which the hon. Gentleman will see that there is a provision for there to be a majority of registered teachers on both Committees. I think that that meets the hon. Gentleman's point. We have related the Bill primarily to the 1960 Act, but I shall look to see whether it can be improved in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One is always grateful to the hon. Lady for considering things, but I do not think that she has really answered the point made by my hon. Friend about the members of the Committees being members of the Council. The hon. Lady referred to subsection (4,	<i>a</i>). This seems to indicate—I do not know whether this is what she means—that the Council, if it wanted, could appoint three, four, five, or six registered teachers from outside the Council altogether to investigate a case of complaint on which an investigation was requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My feeling—and I should like the hon. Lady to think about this rather carefully before Report—is that this is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
a very desirable idea. It may be that in certain cases teachers in the area from which the complaint has come have more personal knowledge than individual members of the Council, and to that extent the hon. Lady may feel that they could come to a better conclusion, but I do not share that view. It is important that a small number of people should look into these cases. It is also often important that these people should not necessarily be too close in place, so to speak, to the point from which the complaint comes. There are other Amendments which I do not want to anticipate, but I think that there is a great deal to be said for both the Investigating and the Disciplinary Committees being small, and consisting of members of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady will not overlook that point when she comes to consider it. It has been on the Notice Paper for a week or more, and I am sure that she has had time to consider it, but we know that she is busy, even if there are no positive signs of it at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is wrong for us to decide what is the best size for these Committees? Surely the people in the best position to decide that are the members of the Council? Why should we lay down in advance how many people will investigate any complaint, or discipline any member? I can think of very good reasons why a committee dealing with discipline, or investigating something, should not be a small one. Some people have strong prejudices, and if a committee consists of three people, it requires only two of them to ruin somebody's career. I would not like to say what is the right size of the Committee, and I do not think that anyone here should attempt to do that either. This is a job for the Council itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, there may be cases where it would be advisable for the investigation to be carried out by members of the Council, but there may also be cases where it would be much better for the investigation to be undertaken by outside people. Often in the House we are asked why we do not appoint people from outside the House—such as lawyers, and so on—to sit as chairmen of investigating committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
It would be wrong for us in advance to tie the hands of the Council either as to the size of the Committees or as to who should be the members of them. Surely this is something which can best be decided by the Council itself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that can go unanswered. The hon. Gentleman is well aware that there are a large number of teachers on his side of the Committee, and a few on this, but seriously to suggest that this Committee should not consider whether an investigating committee or a disciplinary committee should be of a certain size is indeed to detract altogether from the purpose of having this Committee. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that if we appoint a Teaching Council, or a Coal Board, or any other body, the House and this Committee should sit back and say, "We have appointed some people to do the job, let them get on with it"? It seems a remarkable argument to use in this Committee of all places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had the hon. Gentleman been a Member of the House for the last five or six years he would be staggered at the speed with which the Bill is passing through the Committee, in spite of the enormous amount of verbosity from his side. In spite of the speed that we are making, he says that we should not consider this matter. I am sure that the Council will consist of able and carefully selected people, but will they be people in a class above Members of Parliament, even Members who happen to have been teachers before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting for a moment that we should not decide who are to be members of the Council, just as we decide, for example, who is to be the Chairman of the National Coal Board. What I am saying is that we should not tie the Council's hands. What is the point of setting up a Teaching Council and then hamstringing it by regulations and details of all kinds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea behind the Bill is to give a little more power to the teachers through the Council. If the right hon. Gentleman does not want to give the Council any power, there is no point in having the Bill. We can simply leave the power in the hands of the Secretary of State. We are trying to give the Council more power, and we must not tie its hands any more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>235</span>
than is necessary or advisable, and in this case I do not think that it is necessary or advisable to try to tie it on these two question of detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), I completely fail to understand the arguments which have been adduced by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig). If we carry his argument to a logical conclusion we might ask what is the purpose of this Committee, and why are we wasting our time sitting here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pass from that to thank the hon. Lady for the very understanding way in which she has received the Amendment. There is a point of substance here, and I am grateful to the hon. Lady for agreeing to consider the matter between now and Report, but I am disappointed that she has not answered the second part of the Amendment which asks that members of these Committees should be members of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that there is a danger here, particularly with regard to an investigating committee, that there may be a temptation on the part of the Council to appoint a retired policeman to one of these committees. There is nothing to prevent the Council from doing that. We have a precedent for it, because to the best of my knowledge and belief, the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association has appointed an ex-policeman to be its secretary. Whether he has made a good job of it or not is a matter of opinion, on which I express no opinion here, but there is that precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for that to happen, and I ask the hon. Lady to give serious thought to that and to the second part of my Amendment which provides that the members of these committees should be members of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be the impression here that I am suggesting something quite unusual. I am doing nothing of the kind. All that any administrative body does is to set out the broad issues of policy. It does not deal with details. One might as well argue that we should say to the Coal Board, after appointing it, "You will sell your coal at such a price", or "you will employ so many miners". It might even be said that we should tell the Electricity Board how much to charge for electricity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
It is the duty of any legislative body to settle the broad questions of principle. That is all that we should do. Then, if the authority concerned does not carry out our instructions, we can supersede it with something else, but to try to get down to details of this kind is sheer stupidity, and it will never work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of my local authority there was a certain individual whom we regarded as a firebrand. He had all sorts of ideas about how our transport department should be reorganised and run. Eventually he became the transport convener, the chairman of the transport committee. After he had been in that job for two years, there was no sign of any of the revolutionary changes of which he had spoken, so I asked him what had happened to all his ideas. He told me that he was too busy keeping the buses running to have time to think about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That illustrates what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is suggesting. This colleague to whom I referred got so bogged down with detail that he had no time to think about policy, which is what he was there for. If, in advance, we tie the hands of the Council, it will be hamstrung and will be prevented from doing its job. The question is whether we have the administrative outlook required to give the Council the power to do the job that we want it to do. That is the difference between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sheer nonsense to suggest that I am trying to give away the power of Parliament, or of this Committee. I have no intention of doing that. The power of this Committee should be used, not to settle details, but to settle broad principles of policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) has completely misunderstood the purpose of the Amendment, because during the course of his last few remarks he said that if we gave the Council power to arrange these committees, without specifying, as the Amendment provides, how many members there shall be, or of whom these members shall be composed, and the Council does not do the right thing, we can tell it to do something different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the moment when we have to consider whether we shall lay down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
the general principles within which the Council is to operate. There is no power anywhere else in the Bill—and the hon. Lady will correct me if I am wrong—for the Secretary of State, or anybody else, to tell the Council that it should do something differently if what it does is considered to be wrong. It is because there is not this power in the Bill that we are seeking to clarify the issue by giving the Council guiding lines on the size of these committees, and the type of members whom we think it is advisable should serve on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is making rather heavy weather of this problem. We should give this job to the Council, but I am rather perturbed that in respect of the membership of either the Investigating Committee or the Disciplinary Committee there is a possibility of outside persons taking part. It should be made quite clear that members of these Committees should be members of the Council, and it should be just as evident that they will operate as committees of this kind always do—both in the trade union world and in respect of the wider affairs of the House of Commons—when they are set up to do a particular investigating job. They should have power to bring before them witnesses from the locality or from the school concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They should have this power in order that we can have better control during the whole of the proceedings, and in respect of the report back to the Council on the matters which are being dealt with. It would be a very bad thing if we gave the Council power, in setting up either of these two Committees, to draw upon outside bodies for their membership. They should be comprised of members of the Council, and these Committees should have the power to call before them any witnesses they wish in order to help solve the problem they are dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wonderful exposition of 	<i>laissez-faire</i> Liberalism from the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
This question of discipline is one of the most important parts of the Bill. A person who enters the teaching profession enters it not merely because it is another job but because—we hope—he considers it to be a vocation. To enter the profession he has to go through teaching college and undergo a long period of training. As such he forgoes for many years the level of earnings that he might have been able to obtain outside the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with cases coming before it the Disciplinary Committee will have power to benefit or mar a person's whole career, and since we must bear in mind the vocational aspect of the career and the many years of training which have gone into it, it is clear that detailed consideration must be given to the way in which these disciplinary powers will be applied. I hope that the Under-Secretary will give more consideration to this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that I shall consider the Amendment.

It is clear that it is not possible at once to accept such an Amendment. It would not always be the best way of making the improvement.

Leaving out the discourtesies and confining myself to the courteous remarks, I think that it will be valuable to examine the Bill before Report and see whether it can be further improved by meeting the points which have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her most gracious acceptance of the Amendments. I agree that she is entitled to have further time to consider them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 5, to leave out "have his name removed from the register" and to insert:
	<br><q><p>"disciplinary action under subsection (1) of the next following section".</p></q>
It might be for the convenience of the Committee if we deal also with Amendment No. 79, in page 7, line 12, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, if the disciplinary committee are of the opinion that a registered person has been guilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect, but that such conduct is not of sufficient gravity to warrant the removal of that person's name from the Register, that committee shall be entitled to censure such person and, if it thinks fit, to impose a fine on him not exceeding £100.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that agreed? It is agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words that I propose to leave out are
	<br><q><p>"have his name removed from the register".</p></q>
That is the only penalty envisaged by the Bill in the event of certain circumstances dealt with by the Disciplinary Committee. If that Committee imposes any penalty it must impose the dreadful
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
penalty of removing the offender's name from the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an exceptionally harsh provision. There will be cases where an offender has been guilty of professional misconduct or of some offence which requires recognition by the Council but which is not of such a nature as to demand the severe penalty of striking his name off the register. Such a penalty is absolutely damning to the teacher for the rest of his professional life. Even if his name is subsequently restored to the register the dreadful stigma of removal will always remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and I put down Amendment No. 79. We propose that where a registered person
	<br><q><p>"has been guilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect, but … such conduct is not of sufficient gravity to warrant the removal of that person's name from the Register, that committee shall be entitled to censure such person, and if it thinks fit, to impose a fine on him not exceeding £100".</p></q>
Those words have been taken in their entirety from the Solicitors Act as it applies to Scotland. The Bill, excellent thought it is in many ways, does not confer the power of censure. Hon. Members will probably agree that up to that point the Amendment is unexceptionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last part of Amendment No. 79 is probably more debatable. The imposition of a fine has been found very useful in the Solicitors Act. A penalty of up to £100 is one of some severity, but it is nothing like as severe as the ultimate penalty of having one's name struck off the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the hon. Lady to accept the Amendments as worded, but I hope that in considering them her administrative zeal will be tempered with mercy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. It raises a very important point. The Disciplinary Committee has to be satisfied that the alleged offence is of such gravity that the only penalty open to it is removal from the register. I suppose that the Committee will have among its membership a majority of teachers with experience of general work in the classroom and outside. I am sure that it will be very careful in its approach to any charge made against a member of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
As the Bill stands the Committee can decide only one thing, namely, that the offence alleged is of such gravity that only removal of the offender's name from the register can be considered an adequate punishment. I am sure that my experience is shared by other hon. Members who are familiar with the work of education authorities. They will know that many minor offences which teachers commit from time to time do not warrant the removal of their names from the register and the removal of their right to earn their livelihoods in the profession in which they have qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will this establishment of the Disciplinary Committee entirely remove from the sphere of consideration by a local education authority the question of an alleged misdemeanour by a teacher in its own service? At present each education authority is unfortunately faced with the unwelcome duty of considering from time to time an offence committed by one of its teaching staff. It must examine the report of its director of education and decide what course of action should be taken against the culprit. Decisions can vary from committee to committee and education authority to education authority, and even according to the composition of a committee at one time as opposed to another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this Committee comes into being will it supersede any similar investigating committee set up by a local education authority? We cannot have two bodies sitting in judgment on members of the profession, on the one hand at local level and on the other at national level. If it is felt that local educational authorities should cease to investigate offences committed by members of their staffs the question arises whether, when an offence has been drawn to their attention, it will be incumbent upon them to communicate the facts of that alleged offence to the Council. I assume that by various methods the Teaching Council will know of these cases, but will it be the duty of local education authorities to draw to the attention of the Disciplinary Committee any cases of professional misconduct which may have been brought to its attention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, I hope that the Disciplinary Committee will not be a terribly busy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
organisation. Human frailties are such that some people tend to pounce on the activities of certain individuals. In this connection, I wonder what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has in mind by the use of the words "infamous conduct" in the Amendment. Would charges of drunkenness and so on come within that expression? I fear that the Disciplinary Committee might become a little too busy and I hope that the Under-Secretary will express the Government view on its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Disciplinary Committee will appreciate that something other than removing the name of a teacher from the professional list should be considered. We should also remember that new entrants to the profession may begin to wonder what this is all about. At present a new teacher considers questions of salary, conditions and so on, but disciplinary procedure against him does not enter his mind. I appreciate that it enters the minds of people going into the medical and legal professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Disciplinary Committee we are considering will be concerned solely with removing an individual from the register or taking no action at all that might be a deterrent to a would-be teacher thinking of joining the profession. I hope that my hon. Friend will explain what the Government consider will be the role of the Committee. We hope that the new Teaching Council will play some part in helping us to achieve the amount of recruiting necessary into the profession. It is to be hoped that the activities of the Disciplinary Committee will not result in a lessening of the recruiting rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With these few misgivings, I welcome the consideration of the position which the Committee is giving to this matter, for it would be interesting to know whether there will be a halfway house, so to speak, form of punishment as suggested in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the Under-Secretary to be careful about this matter. I do not dissent from my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) in the idea of having a penalty of censure, but I have grave doubts about giving the Disciplinary Committee power to levy a fine of even up to £200. In my view it should be a point of principle that only the courts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
may impose fines. We should stick to that principle. I would ask the hon. Lady to consider the Bar in England, which has had long experience of this. There is power to censure or strike off, but, I think, no power to impose a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, if I may, to have her views on the words "serious misconduct". They are rather vague. Serious misconduct could be a criminal offence. I should like some explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, hope, that the Committee will approach this matter—not only as envisaged in the Bill but as suggested in the Amendment—with very great care indeed. I am particularly concerned with the words in the Amendment:
	<br><q><p>" … if the disciplinary committee are of the opinion that a registered person has been guilty of infamous conduct …"</p></q>
I have always thought that the word "infamous" concerned a most serious charge; indeed, one of the most serious charges that could be levelled against anyone, teacher or otherwise. Infamous conduct is something which one speculates about and regards as a dreadful thing. Yet in the Amendment we are asked to speculate about infamous conduct without there being any definition or guide as to what is meant by those words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear to apply only in a professional respect and to an individual who is a member of the teaching profession. I find it difficult to imagine how infamous conduct could take place in a professional way. Perhaps the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) will enlighten us as to what was in his mind when he included the words "infamous conduct" in the Amendment. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) could cite cases of infamous conduct in the teaching profession, but speaking from experience, as a teacher and headmaster in large schools, I have no recollection of having met with a case of infamous conduct in the professional respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In applying it not from the professional point of view, does it mean that infamous conduct, perhaps in its social aspect, is something which is entirely exempt from the consideration of the Disciplinary Committee, as well as from the penalties open to it? Is there a separation between one standard of infamous conduct for people in a public service from both the professional and social points of view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
I believe that any committee, local or national, must have the power to interview its employees and to censure them, but when considering the application of a fine—and the one suggested in the Amendment is £100—we must consider that this is an entirely new departure and one which must be carefully thought about because the question immediately arises, how does one get the £100? I mention this because there is no registration system across the Border, where there is a great demand for teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every day we see how people in industry react when the courts apply penalties on workmen—in respect of, say, the care and maintenance of wives and children. Those men merely go across the Border and obtain work there. I have raised cases of this in the House of Commons with the former Lord Advocate, but he could do nothing about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That must have been some time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. It has been going on during my years in Parliament, and as Tory Governments have been in office for most of that time I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that what I say applies with greater effect to a Tory Government than any other Government, but I was not thinking of it in those terms. I was simply pointing out that the Lord Advocate is the person to whom we go with these problems, yet he is unable to do anything about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what would happen if the Disciplinary Committee imposed a fine of £100 on a teacher. The teacher could go across the Border and get a job in England, where registration is not required. What will be the result if that is to be the way of dealing with infamous conduct? We have lost a teacher, the penalty is inoperative, and England has gained another Scotsman. It is all very well coming to a decision when considering what should be done, but that decision must be capable of being put into practice. I do not want at this stage to say anything about what is proposed in the Bill, as against what is proposed in the Amendment, because I would rather hear my hon. Friend's explanation of this part of the Bill before coming to a decision on this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee, but we are now dealing with a most important question and we must remember that of the two Amendments before us the first deals with the powers of the Investigating Committee while the second deals with subsection (1) of the next Clause and the powers of the Disciplinary Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more concerned with the word "liable". The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) rather thought that the only decision which could be arrived at would be the removal of the name of the teacher from the register, or otherwise no action at all. I cannot agree with that view because the hon. Gentleman will notice that in subsection (2) appear the words:
	<br><q><p> "… if, after such investigation, it"—</p></q>
That is, the Investigating Committee—
	<br><q><p>"considers it just to do so, the Investigating Committee shall refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee."</p></q>
That presupposes that decisions other than the one indicated by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West could be arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in this respect that I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain what will happen if the Investigating Committee considers that although an offense has been committed it is not one of such gravity that it should be sent to the Disciplinary Committee. In other words, what will happen if the Investigating Committee considers that the person should not be liable to have his name removed from the register?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also somewhat concerned about cases which are dealt with by the Investigating Committee and which, after decision, go to the Disciplinary Committee but without report to the Teaching Council. This would appear to be a strong power, for the Disciplinary Committee would appear to have power to remove names from the register without recourse to the parent body. It is a wide and unaccustomed power, compared to that given to bodies on which I have served. I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to justify this position and tell us if the Investigating Committee can arrive at a less serious decision than that indicated by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West. Although I would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
not support the hon. Gentleman in what he is trying to write into Clause 11, namely, a fine, I should like to know how the Disciplinary Committee would deal with a case in which a teacher was not liable to be removed from the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised, not only by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), but by my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern), Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), and Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), and by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison). To take them as they emerged, this Amendment, in page 6 line, 5, is presumably regarded as preparing the way for the Amendment in page 7, line 12. It would not be right for the purpose, but nevertheless I accept that this is what it is intended to do and I accept that we are directing our attention to the latter Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this to my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire, answering the point which emerged in other speeches. Where the penalty of removal from the register seems to be too harsh, there is a power for the Disciplinary Committee, as recommended by the Wheatley Committee, to warn offenders—to give warnings as a possible preliminary to removing their names from the register if the offence were repeated and no notice were taken of the warning. The only statutory penalty is removal from the register, but this is statutory and is followed by the provision of appeal on this question. So, although this is the only statutory penalty, there is power for the Disciplinary Committee to give a non-statutory or unofficial warning if it should decide that a last chance should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made clear in earlier discussions that removal from the register does not necessarily mean removal for all time. On the contrary, it would be open to a teacher to apply in due course for restoration to the register. Clauses 10 and 11 make full provision for applications to be made for restoration to the register. The only limitation on applications for restoration is that, under a later subsection, the Disciplinary Committee may include in the direction for removal from the register a stipulation that an application may not be made within a specified period which is not to exceed 12 months from the date of direction. Given the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
scope for non-statutory or unofficial warnings, and given that removal from the register does not necessarily mean removal for all time, the Bill in fact provides an effective and appropriate sanction in accordance with the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee, which did not recommend monetary penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did it not do so and why would monetary penalties in this case be inappropriate, however appropriate they may be in relation to solicitors who commit offences which it is considered lay them open to discipline? Infamous conduct in any professional respect—people have asked how the infamous conduct would be defined—is admittedly not something which can reasonably be defined in advance. The whole essence of the self-government of a profession is that the profession determines what is unprofessional. So it is not possible to bring definitions of this into the Bill. To do so would be to go against the whole aim and object of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, if a teacher is judged guilty of infamous conduct in a professional respect—that is to say, short of and not associated with a criminal offence—it is difficult to see what possible relevance a fine could have. A teacher who has been found guilty in such a way is not appropriately to be accepted as a teacher for the time being. He should be removed from teaching, and he should be away from teaching till there is a reasonable assurance that his ways have changed, that he is a reformed character. The public is concerned here. The interests of children are concerned. We are not concerned merely with imposing a penalty, with inflicting a punishment for an offence which has been committed. We are concerned with protecting children in school from the teaching of a person who has been found by his own professional body—by the Teaching Council—to be guilty of some unprofessional conduct, of infamous conduct as defined by the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has referred to powers which could be vested in the Council. Would she tell the Committee whether it would be within the power of the Disciplinary Committee to suspend and, if so, at what stage would suspension operate? Would it be as soon
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
as the alleged offence was brought to the notice of the Investigating Committee? Would it be after the Investigating Committee had reported that a case had been established and passed the matter on to the Disciplinary Committee? Would there be provision for suspension from duty till the Disciplinary Committee had finally disposed of the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a case where a serious charge was involved, clearly the rules of the Teaching Council governing the Investigating and Disciplinary Committees would have to cover cases where it was essential that immediate action should be taken. My hon. Friend will agree that we are thinking of the most exceptional case. Over the years there has been only a handful of cases which would be regarded as warranting the kind of procedures we are considering now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we cannot expect examples of what is meant by professional misconduct, but may I take it from what my hon. Friend has said that professional misconduct is misconduct which takes place in school hours—that is, within the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Professional misconduct is, I would say, to be defined as conduct which, in the view of the Teaching Council, or of the Committee which it has appointed, renders a person unsuitable professionally to be a teacher. This is the only possible way in which one can define it. I would not suggest that one could limit it in the way my hon. Friend puts to the Committee at the moment, although these would be matters for the Committee to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Govan and Shettleston about the function of the local authority in this matter, as against that of the Disciplinary Committee. Here I think we can be quite clear. Matters of employment are for the employing authority, but Wheatley made quite clear what the procedure would be in these matters. Paragraph 148 states:
	<br><q><p>"The normal procedure which we envisage is that in cases other than those which arise from a conviction for a criminal offence a complaint, whether from a pupil, a parent or another teacher, will go for redress, as it normally does at present, to the headteacher of the school in which the teacher against whom a complaint is made serves and, thereafter, if necessary to the employing authority"—</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
in other words, just as things are at present—
	<br><q><p>"it will, of course, be made direct to the employing authority if it involves a headteacher himself."</p></q>
Again, just as it is at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"The employing authority may refer any such complaint to the Council if it thinks that such a course is justified, and if it refuses to do so the complainer can then make the complaint to the Council itself. The Council should entertain a complaint only if the person making it has first approached these authorities but is dissatisfied with the action (or lack of it) on their part."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that my hon. Friend has directed my attention to these very relevant sentences in the Wheatley Committee's Report. I should like her to tell us where these sentences are given effect to in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that, where a Bill does not effect a change, the 	<i>status quo</i> as it is at present is held to operate. All that I have been saying concerns the situation as it is at the moment, but the employing authority may refer to the Teaching Council anything that it thinks that it would like to refer, just as anybody can refer anything to the Council. If one were to seek to write into the Bill every possible way in which any communication could be made to the Council by anybody, the Bill would be a very long one indeed, because there is nothing to prevent anybody from writing to the Council with some suggestions, some proposals, some complaint, or anything of that kind. My hon. Friend will appreciate that it would not be practicable to bring all this into the Bill. Unless it is prohibited—nobody is suggesting that there is in the Bill a stipulation that such and such a person or such and such an authority may not write to the Teaching Council or may not make a communication to the Council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend and all Members of the Committee are anxious to get a standard form of practice and machinery. However, from what my hon. Friend has just said, I submit that there could be a wide variation between the judgments arrived at in relation to a particular kind of conduct as between one authority and another. Whilst one authority might submit an alleged offence to the Council,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
without its being called upon to do so, another authority might write it off altogether. We shall not get a standard form of practice under which authorities must report certain matters to the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point. He is right. It inevitably takes some little time for a code of practice to emerge when self-government is given to a profession. Here we have the way in which it will operate. Out of its operation will be built up a code of practice and a tradition. If there were to be a difference of judgment, of definition, by different local education authorities in relation to whether they reported a particular matter to the Council, there is, nevertheless, the fact that the individual affected—the parent, or another teacher, or anybody else—might report the matter to the Council. I would imagine that this would occur, because in practice—let us keep our feet on the ground and think about what happens in practice—a matter of this kind has usually been the subject of some public discussion in the locality where it occurs. People usually know about it. I would say that, if the local education authority decided that this was not a sufficiently important matter to refer to the Council there might well be others who would so consider it—perhaps the parents. In this way one can cover the difficulty of variation between authorities, which I agree would be a possibility while a code of practice was in course of being built up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the answers to the points which have been made. I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West will agree that, although the Amendment seeks to carry into the Bill what he quite rightly regards as being appropriate in his own profession, nevertheless there are differences here, because one is thinking of the public interest and of the children in the class. A fine or censure would not be suitable substitutes for the warning and the removal from the register which are envisaged in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for her explanation of the difficulties and for her references to Lord Wheatley's most valuable Report on this and other subjects. I do not

think I am clear yet as to why Lord Wheatley himself decided it as he did in paragraph 146(3), when he made recommendations about the powers of the Disciplinary Committee. Paragraph 140 outlines in considerable detail what is the practice in the legal profession, but Lord Wheatley does not comment upon it, either favourably or adversely.
