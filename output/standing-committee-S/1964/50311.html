Schedule 3.—(PROCEDURE OF DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment moved [9th March],</i> In page 17, line 20, leave out from "followed" to "in" in line 21.—<i>[Mr. Wylie.]</i></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday I was making the point that the Disciplinary Committee set up by the Schedule is really similar to a court of law, and I made reference to the powers which the Committee will have under the Bill for recovering documents and for citing witnesses. In these circumstances it is altogether appropriate that the Committee ought to have power to make its own rules of procedure, but what I question here is whether it ought to have powers to frame its own rules of evidence, and that is the point of this Amendment.<br><br>
The rules of evidence are really rules of law which have been evolved over a very long period of time with the object of achieving justice between the parties, and if we start interfering with the rules of evidence in a committee of this nature there is a risk at least that we may prejudice the right of parties appearing before the committee.<br><br>
For example, it would be competent for the Committee, if it thought fit, to provide that hearsay evidence would be admissible. I do not know whether the Committee would ever dream of making a provision like that, but that is the kind of thing that could fall within the provision "the rules of evidence to be observed".<br><br>
It would be highly prejudicial in my submission if the Committee exercised its powers in that way. It might also provide that the necessity according to the law of evidence for corroboration would no longer be required, and that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
the one witness rule, which is a familiar feature of the English law of evidence but which, with one or two statutory exceptions, is not a part of the law of Scotland, could be embodied in the rules of evidence set up by this Committee. This is the kind of thing which should not be done, and the Committee should not even have power to make decisions of that nature.<br><br>
It is quite true that under paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule there is provision for the Lord President of the Court of Session approving any rules made under this Schedule, and of course there is a safeguard there, because I am quite certain that no Lord President of the Court of Session would ever confirm rules with regard to evidence which conflicted with the law of evidence which is so important in the interests of justice between the parties. To that extent it seems to me that the whole provision here—"the rules of evidence to be observed"—is unnecessary, undesirable, and should certainly be deleted from paragraph 2(1) of this Schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to what the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has had to say because of his knowledge of these matters, but I am wondering if he himself did not supply at least part of the answer towards the latter part of his remarks when he referred to paragraph 2(3) which provides that the rules
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not come into force until approved by the Lord President of the Court of Session."</p></blockquote>
I should imagine that the Lord President, as the rule making or rule approving body, particularly of the law in Scotland, will be a sufficient safeguard, but I think this point ought to be made, that it depends on who the Lord President is. Some Lord Presidents would take a different view from others about this type of rule. I am sorry my researches have not enabled me to locate a certain individual, but I think it is known that there are Lord Presidents who would insist on court procedure being strictly followed in such matters, and individuals coming before such a disciplinary committee would require to have only a solicitor or a lawyer to speak for them. So I think the hon. and learned Gentleman would be wrong.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0310">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
I think the balance of the argument here is in favour of these words being retained.<br><br>
What we are dealing with here is not the rules of procedure but the rules of evidence. The first argument might be that the words "the rules of evidence" are unnecessary. I thought the hon. and learned Gentleman would argue that these words could be argued to be incorporated in the preceding words "rules as to the procedure". The second argument I thought he might have touched on would have been that the Council should not have power to adopt standards lower than those of the courts. Now we come to what I think is the main burden of his argument, that these words referred to in the Amendment are unnecessary because the rules of evidence which apply in the courts would automatically apply in such instances as these. I have doubt whether or not they would automatically apply, and it is precisely for this reason that I should have thought that the words proposed to be left out here are entirely necessary.<br><br>
I do not know whether there are any precedents for this in previous legislation such as the National Health Service Act, Statutes dealing with pharmacists, dentists and others, but I should be very much surprised if there were not to be found in some of these previous enactments words or references similar to this. I should have thought these words ought to be retained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear from the wording of the Schedule that the intention is that the proceedings of the Disciplinary Committee should as nearly as possible resemble the proceedings in a court of law. The Committee is given power to administer oaths, to call witnesses, and require the production of documents, and it is going to have an assessor who can advise on the law. That being the intention it seems to me very strange that the Committee should be given powers to have its own rules of evidence as mentioned in paragraph 2(1). For that reason I fully support the arguments of my hon. hon. and learned Friend.<br><br>
I wonder whether the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has really considered this question. Evidence is a very large and complex branch of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
law. It has been developed over the years by Statute, by case law and the interpretations of judges. It has all the time been designed to secure that an accused person, plaintiff or defendant, has a fair trial. The rules of evidence have been designed over the years so that prejudice, recriminations, lapses of memory, lies, and all the other human failings to which mankind is subject, are taken account of.<br><br>
Both in England and in Scotland the rules of evidence are in my view better than those obtaining in any other system of law, and they are certainly worth following and worth very exact study. It would be total folly to allow a lay Committee to have its own rules of evidence. They would be very amateur and would undoubtedly lead to much injustice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that if there were any such rules which appeared to be amateurish there would be the safeguard of their requiring approval from the Lord President of the Court of Session?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do agree, but there is a misapprehension about evidence. It is a vast branch of the law. Is this Committee to revise all the rules, or what? It would be much better if it were to follow the rules already established and were to have no power to make other rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite sure that if the hon. Gentleman looks at paragraph 6 of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum he will see that the Lord President must approve these rules. Is not that a big enough safeguard? Does the hon. Gentleman not think the Lord President a safe person to pass rules?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that it is a perfectly good safeguard, but that there should be no power to make rules different from those applying in the courts of law. The whole case is unnecessary.<br><br>
If the Committee will bear with me I would like to ask a number of questions. Is hearsay evidence to be allowable? Because that would be a very unusual thing to occur. Secondly, is the one witness rule or the two witness rule to apply if the Committee has special powers to make its own rules of evidence? I should like to know the answer to that. Are witnesses to remain in the Committee during the whole of a case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0311">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
or will they only come in when their own evidence is needed? Are husbands and wives to be compellable witnesses, so that a husband and wife have to give evidence against each other? These are very searching questions and they show how vast and complex is this whole question of evidence. What is going to happen about the expenses of witnesses? They need not give evidence till their legal expenses are paid. What attitude will be taken about the competency of witnesses, expert witnesses, hostile witnesses? What view is to be taken of the evidence of a lunatic, given during one of his lucid periods? Lastly, what about a witness who has an interest in the result of the case? Has that been thought of? Perhaps even more highly important than this case, how about the evidence of infants and minors? That is bound to be vital in a matter of this sort. What weight is to be attached to their words and to their oaths? How is it to be decided whether they understand what an oath is?<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I could continue asking many more questions to demonstrate the difficulty of this subject. I could, for example, put probing questions about the doctrine of estoppel, but I do not wish to take up any more time. This is a very complex subject, and we would be well advised to accept the Amendment to make sure that the Committee follows the established rules already in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take more or less in order the points which have been raised. This paragraph requires the Council to make rules about the procedure to be followed and the rules of evidence to be observed in proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee. Under sub-paragraph (3) such rules will be subject to the approval of the Lord President of the Court of Session. What hon. Members opposite wish us to do is to delete from the Bill the reference to the rules of evidence to be observed.<br><br>
The anxiety expressed has centred largely around the need to make sure that the rules of evidence to be followed by the Disciplinary Committee will in no way be of a lower standard than that of the rules of the courts of law. I support the argument that there ought not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
to be any possibility of that, but the point which hon. Members opposite have missed is that unless those words are in the Bill it will be possible for the rules of evidence adopted by the Disciplinary Committee to be of a lower standard. This is the only safeguard which will make sure that they are not. If the words are removed there will be no provision that the Lord President of the Court of Session must approve the rules of evidence adopted.<br><br>
The provisions are very much common form, and are paralleled in Section 37 (1) of the Medical Act, 1956, and in Schedule 2, paragraph 3, of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act, 1960. It is clear that if the Council had it in mind to set up rules of evidence which in any way fell below those applied in the courts it would quickly be brought to book by the Lord President.<br><br>
It is not possible to go on the basis that the rules of evidence in the courts would automatically apply in proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee unless provision is made to link those rules with the rules approved by the Lord President of the Court of Session. If the words are left out, it will not be possible for the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) to assume that the rules will be those of the courts; nor can it be assumed that they will be of the same standard.<br><br>
We consider it essential to include in sub-paragraph (1) a reference to the rules of evidence, and I am advised that if these words were deleted we should leave room for doubt, which I am sure is the last thing that hon. Members opposite would want. Secondly, the provision has ample precedents. Thirdly, there is the safeguard that the approval of the Lord President is necessary.<br><br>
There is a further point. If no provision is made in the paragraph for the rules to be made by the Council to cover the rules of evidence—this refers to subparagraph (3)—the Council could go on the basis that it had complete discretion. It could argue that it could deal with this matter quite separately, and not according to the rules to be made by it under the paragraph. For example, it could apply as it thought fit what the hon. and learned Member referred to as the laws of evidence, without the safeguard of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
approval of those rules by the Lord President.<br><br>
I hope that I have said enough to indicate that—taking the objective of hon. Members opposite as being one with which the whole Committee would agree, and as one which is entirely admirable and which was in our minds when we drafted the Bill—the only way to provide the necessary safeguards is to leave these words in the Bill, so that there is no discretion on the part of the Council, and so that the Lord President can ensure that the rules made by it shall not be of a lower standard than that of those operating in the courts. What I have said answers the points raised as to hearsay evidence, the evidence of husbands and wives, and so on. All these points will be safeguarded if the words are allowed to remain in the Schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most obliged to the hon. Lady for the long and careful explanation she has given, but if the rules of evidence to be observed before the Disciplinary Committee ought to be the same as those observed in the courts of law, because they have been evolved over many years in the interests of justice, I would have thought the simplest way to deal with the question would be to write into the Bill a provision that such rules must be observed.<br><br>
The hon. Lady is creating a duty for the Council to make its own rules of evidence as well as its rules of procedure. The paragraph says that the Council
<br><blockquote><p>"shall make rules as to the procedure to be followed and"—</p></blockquote>
shall make, those words being understood to be in the paragraph—
<br><blockquote><p>"the rules of evidence to be observed …"</p></blockquote>
as I read that, it is clear that there is an obligation on the Council to submit to writing the rules to be observed.<br><br>
I would have thought that, for a start, that would be a monumental task; and an unnecessary one, because if the Council rewrote the rules of evidence as contained in the laws of evidence they would pass the scrutiny of the Lord President of the Court of Session, but if it departed from those established principles and did what nobody wants it to do—introduced rules of evidence which set a lower standard than is set
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
by courts of law—they would not pass the scrutiny of the Lord President. In that situation it would seem to me that the easiest way out of the difficulty would be not, perhaps, to accept the Amendment—which evidently does not meet the situation—but to write into the Schedule a specific provision that the rules of evidence to be observed by the Committee will be according to the law of evidence as applied throughout the courts of the land.<br><br>
I confess that I had overlooked the provisions of Section 37 of the 1956 Act. One of the great disadvantages of being on one's own here is that it is not possible to look up everything. But I have looked up the provisions relating to the Solicitors' Disciplinary Committee, and I find that they contain no corresponding provision. In practice, the law of evidence is covered by that Disciplinary Committee, before which I have appeared on many occasions. I ask the hon. Lady to reconsider the matter. It seems to me that she is imposing a difficult and unnecessary task upon the Council by requiring it to set up these rules of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Parkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not erudite in the law, and I may have unknowingly fractured it at times. I have been fortunate in not having had to pay undue penalties. It seems to me, however, that a prospective teacher will be subject to two trials. If that is so it will be a unique position for anybody in Scotland. It is possible that a trial before the Disciplinary Committee may have certain safeguards for the teacher, but it is a fact that we shall have in the community individuals who may be subject to two trials for the same offence. If the Schedule becomes law it is possible that the rules of procedure and the rules of evidence followed at the first trial will be different from those followed at the second. That would appear to militate against justice, and I should be glad if my hon. Friend would clear up that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am not at all happy with the hon. Lady's reply. It may be that the Amendment is not properly worded, but I fully share my hon. and learned Friend's view that it would be better to write into the Bill that the rules to be followed shall be those applied in the courts of law. Let
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0313">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
us do it that way. Then there can be no possible mistake as to the meaning of the words. If the Council is to write its own rules it will not have time to do anything else. It will be writing them for the rest of its life, because this is a monumental branch of the law, which needs a great deal of skilled study. Secondly, what rules has the hon. Lady in mind when she says that the Council shall make its own rules? How are these to differ from the rules which apply in the courts today? What points will they cover? The hon. Lady has not answered that point, nor has she answered all the points I raised about witnesses and the weight to be attached to the evidence of witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) for something that he said, because it reminded me of a typical example of the sort of difficulty which could arise. Let us suppose that we have a case of unprofessional conduct which also constitutes a crime at Common Law, or a statutory offence. The offender will be tried by the criminal courts according to a standard of proof which is recognised throughout the United Kingdom—proof beyond all reasonable doubt. That is the crucial standard of proof which must be followed in any matter involving a criminal offence the results of which can affect the liberty of the subject.<br><br>
Unless the Disciplinary Committee follows the same rule of law it is conceivable that an accused schoolmaster will be acquitted on the higher standard of proof in the criminal court but convicted on the lower standard of proof in the Disciplinary Committee. The consequences to him of such a conviction could be as drastic as, or even more drastic than, a period of imprisonment which might have been expected from the criminal court, because the Disciplinary Committee has power to deprive him of his livelihood.<br><br>
The hon. Lady and I are at one in this matter. We want the same standards of evidence to be adopted. That being so, why should we not face the fact and write it into the Bill, so that there can be no doubt about it? I urge the hon. Lady—for whose long explanation I am most grateful, because she has clarified certain points in my own mind—to reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had an opportunity of discussing this point with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), and while I accept what the Under-Secretary has said about this sort of procedure having been followed in previous legislation—although my hon. and learned Friend said that it had not been followed in others—it is clear to me, from everything that has been said on the Amendment, that we are aiming for the same result, and that we want to achieve it by the easiest possible method. I have wandered about occasionally in legal circles during the last few years and I have heard many legal people discussing the possibility of rethinking and rewriting the whole law of evidence. If we can achieve what my hon. and learned Friend believes can be achieved by bringing the rules of evidence to be followed in the Committee in accordance with the rules of evidence followed in the courts, then if there should be, as there may be, in the next five or ten years, changes in those rules, we would be taking off the Committee any responsibility for having to look at its rules to see how they should be changed, because they would automatically be changed when the rules of evidence applying in the courts were changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that we are not now discussing the Amendment, because it is agreed that it would not suit the purpose which the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is conceded that it might not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are probably discussing in our further consideration of the Amendment a possible hypothetical Amendment which might affect the same thing in a slightly different way.<br><br>
The last remarks of the hon. and learned Member were based on a misconception. I do not think that he looked back to Clause 11. He was implying that we were considering the law of evidence in a hearing by the Disciplinary Committee in regard to somebody who was accused of a criminal offence. This is not so. As he will recall from the wording of Clause 11(1), if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
the person has been convicted of a criminal offence there is no question of the Disciplinary Committee having to hear the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but the situation which I was envisaging was of somebody who had been charged with a criminal offence and, on the higher standard of proof in the criminal court, had been acquitted, but that a complaint had been made of professionally infamous conduct, which might well be a matter proper for the Disciplinary Committee to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether it would be. This would be one of the matters within the rules of procedure to be approved by the Lord President, who would have something to say. It would clearly be unfair if someone who had been found innocent in a court of law were to have his case re-heard by a body not in itself a court of law. So that would be covered by the rules of procedure.<br><br>
To answer the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) if what he means by the second trial is the appeal to the Court of Session, those proceedings will be governed by the Court of Session procedure and Act of Sederunt under Clause 12.<br><br>
My main answer to the points which have been made is this. I ask hon. Members opposite, accepting that the Amendment is not a suitable way of achieving their objective, to look again at the whole thesis of their case, having regard to, for example, the rules of the Disciplinary Committee of the General Medical Council. If they do that they will find that one of the possible ways by which these matters may be covered is without need at all for the Disciplinary Committee to work out its own detailed rules of evidence and seek in any way to have any difference between those and the rules of evidence in the courts.<br><br>
Paragraph 43 of the Rules of the Disciplinary Committee of the General Medical Council states, in regard to evidence:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that where any matter is tendered as evidence which would not be admissible as such if the proceedings were criminal proceedings in England"—</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
this is in the English context—
<br><blockquote><p>"they shall not receive it unless, after consultation with the legal assessor, they are satisfied that their duty of making due inquiry into the case before them makes its reception desirable."</p></blockquote>
So the evidence is held to be admissible only if it were in proceedings in a criminal court, with a certain proviso.<br><br>
The proviso relates to the fact that it is not a criminal offence being judged, because, under Clause 11, that is not in consideration. It is the mere fact of there having been committed a criminal offence, or not, as established by a court of law that determines the action which the Disciplinary Committee should take. Here the Committee would be concerned with guilt of infamous conduct in any professional respect.<br><br>
I think that the best thing for us to do, on the understanding that the Amendment would not in any case achieve the objective which the hon. and learned Gentleman hoped that it would—at least, I gather that he agrees that it is possible that it would not—is that he and his hon. Friends should look at this whole matter again and satisfy themselves, by reference to some of the precedents, that our approach is correct, and that there is no need for the fears which they have expressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say one last word on the subject? In the example which the hon. Lady gave, but for the proviso there would be no need for the provision at all, because, as I understand from her reading of paragraph 43 of the Rules of the Disciplinary Committee of the General Medical Council, it provides that the law of evidence as applied in the courts will apply in proceedings before the Council, except in certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And, of course, the exception would have to be approved by the Lord President.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.<br><br>
If the hon. Lady could give an undertaking—but I do not see how she could—that the Committee will make a similar provision under its powers to make rules of procedure, the difficulty might not arise.<br><br>
However, I am happy to leave it on that basis at the moment. The hon. Lady has been advised that my Amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0315">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
would complicate the situation rather than help it. I am not sure about that, but if there is a danger of that happening I would be the last person to press the Amendment. I will, therefore, ask leave to withdraw the Amendment, but the hon. Lady's reference to paragraph 43 might be considered and it may be possible, if necessary, to raise the matter again on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By and large I agree with what my hon. and learned Friend has said, but I have still not had an answer to my question. I asked how far this body will be able to go in making its rules. What has the hon. Lady in mind? What subjects is the Clause to rule about? Does she consider it necessary, since rules already apply to the courts, that different rules should be made? How will they differ? I do not see why legislation applying to doctors—legislation applying in England; no doubt extremely good legislation—should necessarily be the end of the matter. The Solicitors Act operates on a different principle, and that might be better. I do not wish to press the matter further but I ask the hon. Lady to consider the case again, because there are possibilities of injustice. I would much rather that we wrote into the Bill that the rules of evidence shall be followed, so that there could be no possibility of doubt.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 17, line 35, to leave out "or otherwise".<br><br>
This is really a probing Amendment. I can see how a party could appear in person before the Disciplinary Committee or could be represented by counsel or a solicitor. I am not quite sure what is envisaged by other forms of representation. I cannot think of any other form of representation which would be of much use to either the Disciplinary Committee or the individual concerned. I would be glad to know what the hon. Lady has in mind by having this provision that some other category of person might represent a member of the teaching profession whose activities have brought him before the Disciplinary Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand some of the remarks of the hon. And
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
learned Gentleman. Why can he not visualise that some other category of person might want to assist a teacher before a tribunal of this sort?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said "represent".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same thing applies. I should have thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman would be aware that there are many people in a lay capacity—even Members of Parliament, and others; say, friends or members of the teacher's family—who might be asked by the individual to accompany him. I am refraining from making remarks about the hon. and learned Gentleman wanting to have restrictive practices for lawyers and solicitors. There are circumstances in which an individual would want to speak on behalf of a teacher.<br><br>
Temperament comes into this. A member of his family, someone in the trade union movement, or someone like that with experience of tribunals—perhaps at a labour exchange, a National Assistance Board and elsewhere—might be more capable of expressing the case in human terms. It is in human terms that the Committee will be considering many of these matters. A person of the type I have described might be able to express in human terms what someone else, perhaps someone like the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), could explain only in a cold, matter of fact, legal way in arguing a case. Someone like my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), with his warm, human approach, would probably be of greater value in a case of this sort than, say, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West, who might prejudice the teacher's case.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman does not want to be restrictive, but his Amendment would represent an interference with the liberty of the subject. After all, a teacher might be a member of the Close Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren. He might sincerely wish to argue from a different standpoint—from Corinthians, perhaps, or from a different standpoint entirely—and he might not wish to depend on counsel or on someone like the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West. Even the Privy Council has approved rules which provide that any party, being an individual, may appear in person or by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
counsel or solicitor or by any other officer or member of any organisation of which he is a member or by any member of his family. I hope, therefore, that the hon. and learned Gentleman will reconsider his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee but I was rather staggered to note that after the very quiet and calm way in which my hon. And learned Friend moved the Amendment—avoiding, I thought with great delicacy, any possible clash of closed shops—that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), who, I believe, was himself a teacher—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should not apologise, but sympathise, because I would dearly have loved to have been a teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been an undercurrent running through almost the whole of our discussion on the Bill to the effect that people in the teaching profession must be fully qualified and certified to be allowed to be in control of a classroom of children. Now the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill says that, in just as technical and difficult a situation, what he wants is a nice, warmhearted approach, with no cold, calculating accuracy in the courtroom. It would be a terrible thing if the hon. Gentleman were to carry his ideas into schools and if new pupils in this great new technological age were to be taught with a warmhearted approach and without the cold, calculating accuracy which would fit them to pass their examinations.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I do not believe that this is a question of a clash of closed shops. My hon. and learned Friend asked a simple probing question. I think that the hon. Lady will answer it with her usual courtesy, and the Committee can then get on with its business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While not wanting to take on the cloak thrown over to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) I hope that I may on the odd occasion be con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
gratulated for my warmhearted approach against what I think may be iniquity or injustice. During the course of our public lives all of us have been accustomed to representing people at various appeals—for instance, at the Ministry of Labour. At such places we represent ordinary people, either because of trade union connection or even on the basis of a friend. We have discovered that, on some occasions, the cold, calculated, studied attitude of the lawyer—the solicitor—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schoolteacher?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never known a schoolteacher to appear in these circumstances.<br><br>
We have all had experience of occasions when the cold, calculated approach did not get the ear of the chairman. On some occasions, especially during the days of long unemployment in the 'thirties, one felt that one was doing some good on such appeals.<br><br>
I am very pleased indeed that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) indicated that this was a probing Amendment. That indicates that he has some doubt about the Amendment's value. One can surely envisage situations in which the engagement of a solicitor from the most respectable quarter of Edinburgh or Glasgow would not be as valuable as representation by the local secretary of the E.I.S. who would have some knowledge of the school. Therefore, in such circumstances a teacher, because of his trade union position, or the local secretary of the S.S.A., as the case may be, could do a very valuable job. I hope that with the fairness of mind for which the hon. and learned Gentleman is known he will agree that there should be the opportunity for people other than counsel or solicitors to act on behalf of a teacher who has got into difficulties which might lose him his job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take a strictly neutral attitude on any clash of closed shops that may be emerging in the Committee. I will reply to the points which have been made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and by my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) and Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) in as cool a way as I can.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
I think I can best do it by simply saying this. While accepting that the likelihood is that a teacher would wish to be represented by a lawyer, nevertheless he should be free to choose to be represented by a prisoner's friend, a lay person. This freedom of choice was strongly urged in relation to other similar bodies by the Scottish Committee of the Council on Tribunals. The hon. and learned Gentleman will be aware of the reports of the Council on Tribunals in which it has brought out this point. It is because the Council feels very strongly that there should not be a restriction on the freedom of choice for the person who is appearing before the Disciplinary Committee that this provision is included. I hope that this will satisfy the hon. and learned Gentleman. It is with no more and no less than that in mind that this provision is included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always understood that it was inherent in Scottish law that a person had the right to conduct his own defence. Surely that right is not even under challenge? I accept that the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) wanted to probe this matter. I thought that the right of conducting one's own defence, even in the most extreme case, was inherent in Scottish law. Nothing should be done in this Committee to disturb that right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) fails to appreciate that that is not in issue here. It is a question of representation. There is no question here of suggesting that an accused person, or a person brought before the Disciplinary Committee, must be represented by a solicitor or counsel and cannot represent himself, as it were. That inherent right is very properly preserved.<br><br>
I am entirely satisfied with what the hon. Lady has said. I anticipated the arguments put forward, but it seemed to me that it was worth probing to find out exactly what the Government had in mind.<br><br>
I think that the warm-hearted approach when people are fighting for their lives or their livelihood sometimes gets people into the most awful mess. Whatever may be said about the legal profession, it is a profession which is dedicated to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
pursuing the interests of justice and, although in some circumstances it may be thought that the approach is cold and calculated, it is only cold and calculated because it has been proved in practice that that is the way to achieve the best results for the client for whom one is acting.<br><br>
I am perfectly satisfied with the hon. Lady's explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 88. I think that it may be for the convenience of the Committee if we discuss with it the Amendment in page 18, line 42, leave out "(2)" and insert "(1)".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 18, line 15, to leave out from the beginning to "but" in line 16 and to insert "appointed by the Council".<br><br>
This Amendment, and the Amendment in line 42, which is consequential, are drafting Amendments. The hon. Lady will be aware of the passionate interest always shown by the Scottish Standing Committee in trying to improve the drafting of a Bill. She will observe that, if the Amendment were accepted, instead of there being 16 words there would be four. This is an improvement. The paragraph would then read like this:
<br><blockquote><p>"… an assessor to the Committee who shall be an advocate or solicitor of not less than ten years standing appointed by the Council; but if no assessor appointed" and so on. I suggest to the hon. Lady that this would be simple and would have the advantage of removing a word which is not one of the best in the English language, namely, "exercisable".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reply to this Amendment more briefly than I have replied to any other. I agree. I think that it is an excellent improvement. I am very happy to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady very much indeed.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendments made:</i> In page 18, line 39, leave out "paragraph" and insert "sub-paragraph".—<i>[Mrs. Hart.]</i></p>
<p>In page 18, line 42, leave out "(2)" and insert "(1)".—<i>[Lady Tweedsmuir.]</i></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 18, line 47, to leave out "may" and to insert "shall".<br><br>
I almost hesitate to move this last Amendment at the end of the proceedings of this Committee, because never have words had more discussion in Standing Committees than "may" and "shall". I can see hon. Members opposite simply bursting, as there is yet time for them to take their turn in discussing the rival merits of the two words.<br><br>
Sub-paragraph (6) as drafted says that the Council
<br><blockquote><p>"may pay to an assessor appointed under this paragraph remuneration".</p></blockquote>
I seek to substitute "shall" for "may", so that it would be obligatory upon the Council to pay remuneration to an assessor appointed under this paragraph. Why is there some doubt whether the assessor should be paid? For how long is it thought that the assessor should not be paid? In what circumstances should he be paid? Further, how much would he be paid?<br><br>
All these are very important points. I hope that the hon. Lady will feel that she can accept this last Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir), but am I not right in saying that barristers, certainly, and advocates, I think, cannot sue for fees owing to them? Therefore, it does not much matter in this case whether it is "may" or "shall". Will "shall" confer more rights on advocates?</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I approached this Amendment with some trepidation with the thought that we might find ourselves spending more weeks in Committee because of it, but I think that the matter is rather simpler than it appears. The use of the word "may" instead of "shall" again reflects corresponding provisions in other enactments—the Medical Act, the Nurses (Amendment) Act, 1961, and the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act, which all have similar provisions.<br><br>
The essential point is that the assessor will have a contract with the body which appoints him, and he will presumably make his own decision about whether he wants to be paid or not. If he wants to be paid, he will not accept a contract
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
which says that he will not be. The rates, while subject to the consent of the Lord President, will be a matter for arrangement between the prospective assessor and his employer.<br><br>
Using "may" rather than "shall" is simply leaving it open for the assessor to make his own arrangements with the Council and, since an assessor is not likely to work without fee, putting in the word "shall" would, in effect, make no difference. I suggest, therefore, that this is not one of the most earth-shattering questions of "may" or "shall" that the Scottish Standing Committee has frequently discussed, but that it is simply a matter of negotiation between a professional person and the body employing him, and that the word "may" satisfactorily suits the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this not a rather loose way of treating quite an important matter? We have had many debates in the past about the use of "may" or "shall". I do not know whether the Under-Secretary of State has had the opportunity to consult her hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) who has often expressed distinct views on this matter. The fact that the use of "may" in this Bill would follow the precedents of other Statutes is not a good argument.<br><br>
As the hon. Lady has said, it is unlikely that the assessor would work without a fee, and she referred to a contract. Surely, therefore, there should be an obligation on the Government to provide a fee for the assessor who undertakes this duty. The word "shall" would place that obligation on the Government, but the use of "may" would leave the question open. In fairness to the assessors who may be appointed—according to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) they are not in a position to sue—they should be protected by the word "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. and learned Friend confirm that an advocate cannot sue? Barristers, I know, cannot sue. About advocates I am not so certain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State would consider the remarks she has just delivered. She said that it was highly unlikely that an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
assessor would not be paid and, therefore, as it was subject to his own arrangement, it was unnecessary to put in the word "shall". But surely she defeated her own argument. If an assessor will accept a post only if he is paid, then what is the difference in putting in the word "may" instead of "shall"? As she has defeated her own argument, could she not think again?<br><br>
I know that all Parliamentary draftsmen feel that, when they have drafted a Bill, it is absolutely perfect and laymen hardly dare to improve it, but the hon. Lady has been good enough to accept the last two improvements, and as she says that an assessor will have to be paid it is surely logical to put in the word "shall". Could she not, on this one last point, show a little independence? She has come to the Committee suitably briefed, has sought to do her homework, and has listened to the arguments of hon. Members. Can she not have just one little argument with her own advisers? Let us see if she has independence and can change her mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that independence occurs at various points. I felt that it was unfair to the Committee not to allow it to have a debate about "may" or "shall". I myself, and my advisers, see no strong merit in clinging to "may", and, unprecedented though this may be in the closing moments of a Committee dealing with this vital point of permissive as against mandatory powers, can I say that, in the light of the views expressed in the Committee, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
will happily give way on this Amendment?</span></p>
