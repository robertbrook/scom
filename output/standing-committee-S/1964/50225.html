	<div class='title'>Clause 6. (ESTABLISHMENT OF REGISTER.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [23rd February],</i> In page 3, line 47, after "fees", to insert "not exceeding £1".—[	<i>Mr. Monro.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have really said all that I intended to say in this matter. It is simply a question of simplifying the legislation as far as possible, so that one can see in the Clause what Parliament is intending to do without having to go to the Schedule as well. I hope that the Minister will accept the Amendment. I hope, at least, that some of her hon. Friends will speak in favour of it, because on numerous occasions in the past they have spoken of the complexity of Acts of Parliament—and this proposal is designed to simplify this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member, in what he said the other morning, tried to show that it would be better to bring the wording of the Schedule into the Clause. He argued that this would be more convenient for those who have to construe this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to engage in a lengthy argument with him. What is probably at issue at the end of the day is a matter of taste and style. I put it to him, however, that if his point of view were adopted a Schedule to a Bill would be very rare. Carried to its logical conclusion his views would sound as if he would hardly ever have a Schedule. He would almost always seek to bring into a Clause the detailed provisions which are normally contained in Schedules. Although it is quite legitimate to put in a Schedule matters of a relatively detailed or procedural kind, if we were to bring
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
them into Clauses we would have excessively long and complicated Clauses. We can overdo the argument about the difficulty of construing a Clause with its related Schedule. The Schedule is not very long or complicated in this case, but the Clause itself is a fairly long one, and it seemed to us, on balance, better to put into a Schedule rather than into the Clause itself the provisions which bear on the rules that the Council will make under subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member suggested that unless I had some good reason why his proposal should not be adopted I should modify the Bill as he proposes, but the onus is on him to show more conclusively than he has done so far that his suggestion on drafting is an improvement. I do not think that he has done so. Having had the matter ventilated, he will, I hope, be content, and will allow us to proceed to other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very surprised at the hon. Lady's attitude in this case. It is right that I should say something about the matter because one of the Amendments we are also discussing is in my name—namely, to leave out Schedule 2. It is consequential upon the Amendment which has been moved. It seemed to me quite nonsensical that we should have a short Schedule of only 12 lines stuck at the end of a Bill, instead of making it form part of a Clause which is much longer than the Schedule itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady that there are circumstances in which a Schedule is a very right and proper thing, but this is not one of those cases. The First Schedule is a very lone; one, extending to six pages, and it is obviously right that the very complicated set of rules which it lays down should form a Schedule, otherwise the Bill would be unwieldy and difficult to follow, but there is a point of balance at which the convenience of those people who will have to administer the subsequent Act of Parliament must be taken into account, and it seems nonsensical to have a Schedule of 12 lines whereas, by incorporating its provisions into the Clause, many of those lines could be eliminated. If this were done we could cut out the whole of subsection (5). I hope that, in consultation with her advisers, the hon. Lady will agree to remove the Schedule at a later stage, thereby making the Bill a much more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
convenient instrument for subsequent administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady that Schedules are frequently necessary and desirable. If we complicate a Clause with minute matters of detail the end result is less desirable than is the case where the principles are laid down in a Clause and the details are contained in a Schedule. I would not like the hon. Lady to think that the logical result of my argument would be that we would never have Schedules. Of course we must—and a perfect example is Schedule 3, which it would be most inappropriate to incorporate in a Clause. I would never dream of suggesting any such course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Schedule 2, however, there are only two effective paragraphs, namely paragraphs 1 and 3. I do not think that paragraph 2 is necessary at all, and paragraph 4 will automatically go out because it merely refers to a definition in the Clause. It would, therefore, not add any length to the Clause. The Schedule itself, being relatively short and concise, could properly be incorporated into the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady says, it is a matter of taste in drafting. I think that it would be simpler and more straightforward to do as I suggest. There is no great issue of principle here, and no question of loss of face. I hope that the hon. Lady does not feel that as a matter of principle she must oppose drafting Amendments of this kind. I am sure that her Parliamentary draftsmen would be the first to concede that there are occasions when drafting in a Bill of this nature leaves room for improvement. This is one of those occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the hon. and learned Member's argument I assume that it is only some Schedules, within the consideration of the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must point out to the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) that in the Committee the reading of newspapers is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While you are dealing with that point, Mr. Brewis, would you be prepared to give a rather wider Ruling and say that hon. Members should pay full attention to the proceedings in Com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
mittee and not conduct other duties in respect of which, in former years, they have been reprimanded by the Chair for carrying out in Committee? If they do this it means that they cannot give their full attention to the important issues arising in a debate of this nature, and a Bill of this complexity? Will you rule on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly keep the hon. Member's remarks in mind and if I see any breach of the rules I will act accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If seems that the hon. and learned Member is dealing only with Schedules which are of no great length. I take it, therefore, that he is leaving a discretion to the Minister to decide whether or not a certain Schedule should remain as a Schedule or be incorporated in the Clause to which it refers. Even there there is a question to which we might give a moment's thought. As it is, in Committee debates on Clauses very often go very wide, and the Chairman sometimes has to make the matter clear to hon. Members. If we included within a Clause the provisions of a Schedule, however short—and I am not particularly against including short details in the Clauses of a Bill—the argument on both sides would become more diversified than ever, and detail would become mixed up with general considerations. That might lead to a saving of words in the Bill, but we should certainly run the risk of having longer debates than are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to delay the Committee. I have no passionate feelings about the matter. I was about to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that he need not worry about the possibility of my always seeking, as a matter of principle, to resist his Amendments. He may have some pleasant surprises later on. I shall be happy to look at the question again. We may well find that in respect of a particular matter of taste his definition is to be preferred to ours. I shall be happy to consider the matter again, if that will meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most obliged to the hon. Lady. In that case I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is for the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) to say whether he wishes to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one question to ask. Can the hon. Lady give me any indication of what she considers to be the maximum registration fee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not really, because matters of this kind depend on the way in which the Council decides to organise registration—as between, for example, an annual fee, a life registration, and various other possibilities which it might wish to offer as matters of choice. I cannot, therefore, indicate what sort of fee it will be. What I can say is that the fee would presumably be the minimum required to administer the whole scheme effectively. There is no sense in wishing to pile up these funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 1, to leave out paragraph 	<i>(c).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be true to say that the Committee has already given a great deal of consideration to what lies behind the Amendment. It was apparent during our earlier discussion, however, that considerable anxiety exists about the personal detail which it might be thought competent to include in the register. The purpose of the Amendment is to discover to whom extracts can be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are going to accept a considerable amount of detail in the register, in respect of practical work and in the case of the hon. Lady's example, an indication that women are married, there may be other sub-divisions of the register for various practical and understandable purposes. It is therefore conceivable that on the register there could be a wide variety of material which I would have thought would be quite unsuitable to be provided as extracts to anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two points come to my mind. First, either the register must be sufficiently wide to provide a great deal of detail which is bound to include personal matters or it will have to be so narrow that it is confined to names and teaching qualifications. To whom is it proposed to give extracts from the register?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from experience—and it is clear that many other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee share this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
experience—the difficulties of staffing local authority education committees. We know how highly personal things can become, when the individuals concerned are known personally to some or all of the committee considering their merits. I should be very reluctant indeed to believe that any details beyond the bare necessities should be made known on a localised basis, where, after all, individuals have to live and have their being and continue so to do. Perhaps we could put in a provision at a later stage which would restrict the certified extracts which could be given. As it stands at present this paragraph imposes no such restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what are we to anticipate should be provided in the extracts? If we are to assume for a moment that the extracts would be provided for the benefit of staffing committees, what are we going to have? We have had earlier examples of what there should be. This is another case where personal details could be in the register, and where personal details could be handed out to a very much wider public than I should have thought desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any method of amending this paragraph and the only alternative is to delete it entirely. If it were to be deleted entirely, what harm might we be doing? I cannot really see that we would be doing any harm, because it should be possible to get other evidence as to various aspects of the character of the individual. I can see no occasion when it would be necessary to issue a certified extract from the register, because if it were a case of teaching qualifications these would be known from other sources; if it were a case of character qualification this could be known from other sources; if it were a case of experience other evidence could be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I should be very glad if the hon. Lady would explain the purpose for which these extracts would be provided in public; and I include the county council committee, because, after all, the minutes of the county council committee are in most cases covered. I hope that, unless she can justify this paragraph very strongly, the hon. Lady will feel disposed to look at this matter again and will either delete the paragraph according to the Amendment, or will insert a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
qualification restricting the people to whom such extracts should go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the arguments adduced by the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson), but I was a little surprised that with her long and wide experience in the field of education she cannot anticipate the situation in which it would be necessary and in the interests of the teacher to provide certified extracts from the entry in the Teaching Council's register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite sure that the Teaching Council's information will in no way supersede the information which is acquired by education authorities. The Teaching Council, I hope, is not going to be set up as a body which could be cited as a referee about a teacher who applies for a post in some other field of activity. That would certainly not be the purpose of the register, nor would it come within the ambit of the Teaching Council. A local education authority can still build up its own dossier on the teachers in its service. That information will continue to be supplied to the members of the staffing committee of that education authority, when considering a teacher's application for promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Teaching Council could be asked for an extract from the register where a teacher goes abroad. The teacher may produce a certificate of registration with the Teaching Council in Scotland, which, probably, the people in Ottawa or Timbuctoo have never seen before. As many colleges of education do at the present time, they could write to the place of birth or the place of training of the teacher who applies for admission, asking what are the qualifications of the individual making the application. Therefore, in a situation of that kind it would be in the interests of the teacher, and I would regard it as within the duties of the Teaching Council, if the Council were to confirm that a teacher applying for a post abroad or in Scotland had the qualifications which the individual was submitting for consideration to the body which was about to become his or her employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that, for teachers making such application, there is in every case a particular form—one form in the case
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
of Commonwealth countries and a different form in the case of other countries—which asks for most precise and definite information which extends to four foolscap pages and includes two referees? I am bound to say that I think "dossier" is an unfortunate word to use in regard to a person of professional status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to go into the definition of the word. We use the word "dossier" in relation to information which would be acquired by an education authority. The meaning is entirely different from that which is applied to, say, the civil service department of some foreign political Power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So I should hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt about it. They are two entirely different types of document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently in the House raised a case the hon. Lady may know, where there was a person abroad who used false documents and who then came back to this country and was able to get a post as a teacher. I was surprised to find that that person, who had not been a teacher, I think, at any time, was able to get a post on the basis of the documents, which had evidently not been checked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not extend this arrangement beyond the teaching profession, and I should not like the Teaching Council to provide information for employers outwith the teaching profession altogether. Unfortunately, some of our teachers emigrate to overseas posts far too soon after having completed a period of training in Scotland. In such cases I think it would be quite within the province of the Teaching Council to provide a certified extract of the facts of the teachers' registration and qualifications, but probably nothing beyond that. Therefore, it would be in the interests of the teachers themselves, that some provision should be made as is done in paragraph 	<i>(c).</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) talked about a complete dossier of the life history of a teacher, and that, of course, is what we are particularly concerned with. In the discussion which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
we had on Tuesday we came to no form of agreement as to who was to compile this dossier and who was to supply the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used the word "dossier" only in relation to information within the knowledge of the education authority—not in relation to the Teaching Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Member's explanation. We are concerned about where the information is to come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, the facts of an educational qualification should be available to anybody who wants to see them, but we are only really concerned with the other particulars. For instance, is the clerk of the local authority to give information to the Teaching Council, to the director of education, to the convener of the education committee, to head teachers or even to training colleges, and is he to produce an enlarged reference for the particular member on the register? Who is to supply the information? Because it could become exceedingly embarrassing to appointments committees or promotion boards, if the applicant were to know that his personal record—perhaps compiled from information within his own education authority—would be read out to his colleagues. We should bear with the applicant and realise that he would possibly also be in a very embarrassing situation. I should like the hon. Lady the Member for Lanark (Mrs. Hart) to give us some explanation as to where the information, to be supplied under the heading of "other particulars", is going to come from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can, of course, understand the hon. Lady's concern about what this paragraph means, and the Committee affords us an opportunity of offering our own suggestions as to what it does mean, but I wonder if my hon. Friend could confirm whether I am right in thinking, that the whole of subsection (4) is giving the Council the right to draw up its rules about what information will be required. We cannot tell at this stage what details it will decide on. Are we not going too far in trying in this Committee to lay down what details the Council will require? We decide the principles, and it will be for the Council to decide what details it wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
Is not the main point that, from now on, it will not be the Secretary of State who will give the parchment to the teacher; it will be for the Council to register the teacher—paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> applies to that procedure—and after having decided what details it wants the certified extract will be issued by the Council to show that the teacher is qualified. If that is so, then I should have thought that the hon. Lady would be reassured that, although this process looks very much worse, and appears to use sinister words and so on, it is a procedure for issuing the certificate in lieu of the parchment given by the Secretary of State. Will my hon. Friend confirm this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While it is true, of course, that the Council will have great powers in this matter, nevertheless we in this Committee cannot resign all authority to the Council without giving some thought to the matters that may be concerned with this registration. There is the human aspect. We are dealing with men and women, not with pedigree Angus cattle or with prize herds. When we come to registration of these creatures there is a great deal of necessary and important description of the various qualifications of the animal concerned. But, in this case, we are dealing with men and women and must realise that they have private lives like hon. Members, and very often hon. Members object to the widespread information circulated about them without their previous consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) has said is true—that the governing approach to registration will be determined by a supply of information that is no more than what is required by the local authority—then that is a guide. We must have a guide when talking about registration. A teacher has a private life. What he may have done in student days is not necessarily important. Many of the things which he may have done then are not for registration. Nevertheless, if we are not careful in defining our own approach to him, it may result in questions which are just beyond the bounds of legitimate demand.

There was a period in the history of teaching when qualifications were very limited and it was said by many people that the main qualifications to enter the
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
profession could be that one was over 17, vaccinated and of sound moral character. If one added these three qualifications for entry on any register then one was good enough to teach. Now the profession has grown and has to place far greater requirements on applicants to be registered than ever before. Consequently, there has grown with it a feeling that we should know more about prospective entrants to the teaching profession that we ever thought we needed to know. It is there that I say we have to be careful. We have been reminded that references are given to teachers by head teachers. That is true. A head teacher regularly gives such references, but all these are in confidence; they are not for public inspection, and that is one important difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a teacher has to fill in a very inquisitive form when he wants to go abroad to the Colonies or elsewhere, that is a matter within the discretion of the country concerned. It is voluntary. Here, however, he is to be compelled to give the information, and that is a distinction which we have to keep in mind when we are indicating to the Council, as we have a perfect right to do, what our views may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not presume to suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston spoke for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State when he said that, in his view, what should appear in the register would be no more than the information presently required by local education authorities; but if that is the case, then it is doing no harm, but may do a lot of good, to the teacher in his profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by what appear to be the tactics of the party opposite. As I have said before, it is indulging in the creation of Aunt Sallies. They are turning the argument upside down. We must be clear that registration is in the interests of the teachers and not against them. There is no point in hon. Members opposite setting themselves up as great defenders of the individual rights of teachers when the register is being created in order to defend those rights. The whole argument is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register replaces an existing system and I take it that the certified extracts will be supplied to teachers as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
proof of the existence of parchments. It will be easier to that extent. It is wrong to say that this system will invade individual rights. Apart from containing information which any education authority wants, it will probably contain little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Teaching Council is being established under the aegis of Parliament representing a responsible community of teachers. Again, the register must be operated with the co-operation of the teachers. In other words, the very rights which hon. Members opposite claim to be safeguarding belong to those very people whose agreement one must get in order to do this. That is the ultimate safeguard. The fact is that no one needs or wants or is willing to have this kind of information on the register, and, indeed, those whose co-operation one must have for the system will not allow that information to be put in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's tactics are not an attempt to safeguard the rights of the teachers but an attempt to hold up the Bill. The aim of the register is not to attack the individual rights of teachers but to defend them, and safeguard the man who is registered against the encroachments of the man who is not. On one occasion, an individual presented himself to my school as having a first class honours degree in biochemistry and he did, in fact, teach at the school, but he had left school at 15 and he was later arrested for wearing the uniform of a R.A.F. officer. The register will help to safeguard against that sort of thing. The individual has the protection of certified extracts and the local authorities, headmasters and other registered teachers have a safeguard in the fact that, if a man's name is not on the register, he is not a registered teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend, therefore, explain this point? Suppose a man says that he has first class honours and that claim is entered in the register, for his word must be taken. What inquiry then is set afoot to verify the entry? Who conducts such an inquiry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be the same as what happens now in the case of parchments. On passing out of training college one is given the necessary certificate, and that is furnished to the local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
authority. It is the same with a degre diploma or parchment. That is the evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as the hon. Gentleman says, the procedure will not vary but will remain as it is, then presumably the case to which he referred is irrelevent, because, presumably, a way was found around the parchment in that case. In any case we are dealing not with qualifications—I made that plain—but with such other information as may be contained in the register, the details of which are at present unknown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But which are to be decided by the Teaching Council. That is the important point. The Council represents the education interests and is not concerned with the kind of detail the hon. Lady seems worried about. That is the important point and the final safeguard. What we must get into our heads is that the final safeguard is that the co-operation of the teachers is necessary before the scheme can operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and the creation of the register creates exactly those conditions in which these safeguards can take place. It is not against the interests of the teachers but for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can reassure hon. Members, the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) in particular. I refer to paragraph 126 of the Wheatley Report which shows that the Wheatley Committee had this in mind. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under our recommendations, therefore, colleges of education would no longer notify the Secretary of State of the names of successful students. The students would apply individually to the Teaching Council which would then enter the names and details in the provisional register and supply each teacher with evidence of registration in the form of a letter or an extract from the register. At the same time it would be necessary for the Council to notify the Scottish Education Department so that each teacher granted registration might be given a superannuation number and admitted to the Superannuation Scheme. The teacher's qualifications would be attested, when he applied for appointments, by the combination of his degree or diploma, his college of education certificate or diploma (which would, as at present, give details of the subjects he had been trained to teach) and his registration certificate or extract."</p></blockquote>
That, of course, is what the subsection is based upon. As one or two of my hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
Friends have pointed out, this replaces the issue of a parchment or certificate. It is something that the teacher can produce to show that he is a registered teacher. There is no other purpose envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is basing this Amendment on her own premise, on her own view of what she thinks the register might contain. She is not basing her argument on anything I have said it may contain. I have looked up what I said on Tuesday on the question of the entries of details of birth, type of school and marital status. I said that the Council would be a responsible body of people with a great deal too much to do to probe into individual qualities and other information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great many of us have specific cases in mind. A case I have in mind is that of a person who has a breakdown, which, the hon. Lady will agree, covers a very wide range of difficulties. One could argue that this must not be put in the register, but one could equally argue that it is so important that some reference would have to be made to it. If the register is to exclude things of that kind and many other details, that is fine, but we have no assurance that it will exclude them. If only those with experience of cases like this could determine whether breakdowns should in some form or other be recorded or excluded, I would be more content. I am perfectly happy about what the hon. Lady said on Tuesday in terms of pure qualifications, but some hon. Members suggest that there is no limit to this. I would like her to say whether such things as breakdowns would be entered in the register or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can assume—one is legitimately entitled to assume—that, acting in the interests of teachers, the General Teaching Council would not permit something to be included in the register which would be likely to harm the interests of the teacher. That is the essential point. There is no greater likelihood than that, if a matter of this kind were suggested as being suitable for inclusion in the register. If it would harm the interests of the teachers, it would not be included, because the Council would exist as a body operating in the interests of the profession and of education as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
One would suppose that the extract from the register would be confined to the teacher's name and qualifications, with the dates of his or her qualifications and registration and, presumably, marital status. I do not suppose that any teacher would have a strong objection to being described as Mrs. if in fact she was Mrs. rather than Miss. This is what one assumes. Registration will take the place of certification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> were not to be included in the subsection the teacher would have nothing to take the place of the parchment, the certificate, which he or she has at the moment. Registration is a means of giving to the teacher some evidence that he is what he claims to be and has the qualifications that he claims to have, and he can quote from the register which has brought him into the profession as a teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members want to be sure that the scope of the power of the Council is not too great, it is as well to include this paragraph, for it is a means of defining the extent to which the Council may operate in connection with the issue of extracts from the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Lady that this is a necessary paragraph and that her doubts and anxieties are unwarranted and that, as the Teaching Council will be making sure that the interests of teachers are safeguarded, this is a perfectly logical step following the withdrawal, as it were, of the parchment and its replacement by registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has pointed out exactly why many hon. Members have expressed doubts and genuine anxieties about these matters, not so much about paragraph 	<i>(c),</i> which might remain in the Clause in its present form, although it was very important to raise the matter and the anxieties connected with it, but because the Under-Secretary again referred to the phrase in an earlier part of the Clause "other particulars as may be prescribed". She also used such words as "I assume" and "We must assume" and "We think that the Teaching Council will do this"—or that—"in the interests of the profession". We are here discussing the contents of what will be an Act of Parliament, and it is important that we should try to get this provision as clear and as definite as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
possible, so that in the years ahead, whoever may eventually serve on the Council, what is meant by these words is absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "other particulars as may be prescribed" give a very wide latitude, as is quite apparent. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) may feel disposed to leave paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> as it is, and perhaps we can consider whether some clearer definition of "other particulars" can be suggested later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lady should remember that the membership of the Teaching Council will not be permanent and that 25 members will have to submit themselves for election and re-election. People who would ask such outrageous and wholly irrelevant questions would never be re-elected to such a body by those who put them there in the first place. If a safeguard is needed, that is a safeguard which will ensure that the questions, and the contents of the register, are such as the profession itself would desire, and no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not suggesting that outrageous particulars would be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that was the direction of the argument by the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are saying that in an Act of Parliament, which, we hope, will stand for many years, we should be as definite, as clear and as precise as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are still one or two matters which should attract our attention. There is no argument about teachers wanting to be registered. This is a safeguard and no teacher would suggest otherwise. However, there is an aspect of this matter which I shall raise later and about which I should wish to be assured, for the definition of "teacher" is now to be immensely widened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If registration is to be a substitute for the parchment, we have to remember that the parchment was the private possession of the teacher and that nothing about it could be divulged without his permission. Certain extracts about him
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
may now be reproduced without his consent for the information of those outside his ken, perhaps by a Council in whose election he has had some say. But his position will nevertheless be fundamentally altered. He will be safeguarded, because he will be registered, but as an individual he will have no control over the extracts provided from the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are matters which we are wise to discuss here, so that the Council will take note, and see what provision can be made to defend the position of teachers, or for consulting individuals about the provision of extracts for quarters outwith their ken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I take it that no adverse comment about a teacher will appear on the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that there would not be. I know that the noble Lady will say that I cannot say that, because the responsibility is being left to the Council, but I assume that nothing of that kind would appear in the register, assuming that the Council, representing a self-governing profession, would be protecting the interests of that profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is also the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). When he says that the teacher would have no rights to ensure that the substitute for his parchment was in nobody's possession but his own, he forgets that what the teacher is doing is giving to his own elected representatives and other members of the profession and other people connected with education the right to safeguard his interests. This is essential to the basis of the setting up of the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that the whole concept of registration is not to be regarded as one means by which an employment bureau can be conducted. It is not that kind of thing, but is a process whereby the teacher comes into the profession and is admitted to the profession. There is no fear in my mind that, given the composition of the Council and given its purpose and duties, it will do anything, or even contemplate doing anything, which would harm the interests of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In seeking to protect the rights and liberties of individual teachers, as apparently they do, hon. Members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
opposite are in danger of preventing the Council from acting effectively on behalf of the teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose that a teacher has a prison record—and I know of such cases—before entering the profession, and in the profession holds a position of high responsibility with great success. Would that be on the record in any form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is confusing what we are now discussing with the fitness of a teacher to teach, which is a matter decided under Clause 2. Once it has been decided that here is a person who may become a teacher and who may be admitted to the register there is no reason why the register should contain anything which is not wholly relevant to the person's qualifications to be a teacher. In other words, there is no reason why any background fact about the teacher should emerge from the register. I cannot see any point in the Council reaching a decision that there should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can follow the hon. Lady's argument about something which has happened prior to registration, but if, subsequent to registration, a teacher is found guilty by the Disciplinary Committee of infamous conduct in a professional respect, is that the kind of thing which would be recorded? Is it envisaged that that kind of conduct would be recorded for future reference, for example in the event of a recurrence after readmission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman may be anticipating a discussion on Clause 11(4), which provides for the removal of a name from the register and for its re-entry in certain conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Accepting that that has happened, would that be the kind of thing which would find its way on to the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that this was a separate question. The period during which a person's name is not included in the register clearly does not affect the extract from the register at the point at which it is contained in the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the infamous conduct of which he had been convicted

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is this not more appropriate for discussion when we reach Clause 11(4), which deals with refusal or non-refusal to an application for registration or reregistration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something in that point and I will try to restrict the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It had not been my intention to press the Amendment to a Division, although I have not been happy about the way in which the discussion has gone. There will be a later opportunity to discuss what was said by my noble Friend which may be fundamental to what I have been saying, and there may be a better opportunity to raise this matter when we reach Clause 11. Nevertheless, I ask the hon. Lady to appreciate the considerable concern and to remember that there is a wide range of difficulty which has not been mentioned and which would come within disciplinary consideration.

Will the hon. Lady therefore undertake to review with care such things as will go into the register, and such things as will not? As my hon. Friend said, the point really is that unless we write into the Bill definite restrictions as to what shall go in, and what shall not, we have no guarantee that in the future others will not interpret the Bill differently from the interpretation put on it by the hon. Lady this morning. If she were to give an assurance that she would consider this point, I would beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 3, to leave out paragraph 	<i>(d).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very short matter, and not one on which I feel at all strongly, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
it seems to me that paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> is not really necessary. Subsection (4) gives the Council power to make rules
	<br><blockquote><p>"with respect to the form and keeping of the register, and the making of entries and alterations therein".</p></blockquote>
It is concerned entirely with the construction of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> gives the Council power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribe anything required or authorised by this section to be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1) imposes on the Council a duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to establish and keep a register containing the names, addresses and such qualifications and other particulars as may be prescribed …"</p></blockquote>
If the Council has power to set down qualifications of that nature, and to make rules with regard to the structure of the register, it seems to me to be quite unnecessary to go on to say that it has power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribe anything required or authorised by this section to be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
I do not hold myself out to be a parliamentary draftsman, and if the hon. Lady is satisfied that this paragraph is necessary, then by all means keep it, but, looking at it purely from the commonsense point of view, it seems that if the Council has power to make rules on these matters, it is not necessary to say that it should have power to prescribe anything which is required to be prescribed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that I have looked at this very closely indeed. Quite clearly it is the kind of paragraph which raises in one's mind the question, is it really necessary? Having looked at it very closely, and established to my satisfaction that it is necessary if one is to catch up the provisions in subsection (1), as the hon. and learned Gentleman has pointed out, it is clear that if this paragraph were taken out, "as may be prescribed" in subsection (1) would be left in the air. The deletion of paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> would make it necessary for matters falling to be prescribed under the Clause to be prescribed otherwise than in rules made by the Council under subsection (4). It is a technical matter, but I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that I am satisfied that as the Clause is drafted, and as subsection (4) is drafted, paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> is required to catch up subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4) says that "prescribed" means
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribed by the Council in rules made under this subsection."</p></blockquote>
The Council has power to make these rules by references to the whole purpose of the Clause. The keeping of the rules must include power to prescribe what is required. I do not want to be dogmatic, and if there is doubt about it—it does not seem as clear to me as it does to the hon. Lady—perhaps it ought to be kept, and accordingly I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 5, to leave out paragraph 	<i>(e).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was filled with hope this morning when the hon. Lady said that we might be surprised that she might accept some of our Amendments. I hope that this is one of them. I was rather surprised that the last Amendment was not accepted, because, like my hon. and learned Friend, I cannot see the purpose of paragraph 	<i>(d),</i> but, be that as it may, he has withdrawn his Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 	<i>(e)</i> seems, both to my hon. and learned Friend and to myself, to be completely and utterly meaningless. Subsection (4) says that the Council may make rules, and that rules made under this subsection may in particular do certain things. One of those things is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make such consequential, ancillary and incidental provisions as appear to the Council to be expedient for the purposes of the rules".</p></blockquote>
That seems to be unnecessary. To use the hon. Lady's favourite word, it seems tautologous, or, to use a phrase which I prefer, tautological, but she may have some objection to that. At any rate, this subsection gives general power to make rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes on to prescribe particulars, and I am surprised that the parliamentary draftsmen have not included that phrase beloved of lawyers, "without prejudice to the foregoing generality". I cannot understand why they have not included these words, because they seem to be even more necessary than the words in paragraph 	<i>(e).</i> Having given the Council general powers to make rules, it Seems ludicrous to give it power to make such
	<br><blockquote><p>"consequential, ancillary and incidental provisions as appear to the Council to be expedient for the purposes of the rules."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
This is not a Council of idiots. It is a high-powered Council, consisting of representatives of the universities, of the teaching profession, and so on. When we are setting up a Council of that soft, cannot we give it a certain amount of discretion to make sensible rules, without giving it specific powers to make consequential, ancillary and incidental provisions? I hope in this case the hon. Lady will give us a pleasant surprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. I did not say that it was this morning that I would necessarily have concessions to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have inquired into this very closely. It is one of those subsections which seem to the layman to require a good deal of justification. I am assured that it is a normal provision, and I have satisfied myself that it is. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, it appears in a great deal of legislation of this kind where one is concerned to remove any possible doubt about the powers that are given under legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he trusts the Council to be sensible. The general tenor of the argument from his hon. Friends this morning suggests that they have too little faith in the Council to be sensible. There is nothing sinister or far-reaching about this paragraph. The purpose is to make sure that the Council will have power to include in the rules under the subsection any of the things—and I do not want to be tautologous myself—laid down here as being consequential, ancillary and incidental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of things might be involved here? One would not wish to circumscribe the Council in a matter of this kind by preventing it from filling out its rules in any procedural or administrative way which it might think necessary to make the rules workable in practice. For example, one can think of the use of forms. The Council may supply forms to be used for any of the purposes of the rules, such as for initial application, or final registration on completion of probation, and it might require that these forms should be used, or it might wish to make a rule for the transmission of documents. It may decide that certain documents should be transmitted by registered or recorded delivery post, or it might want to confer on the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
registrar a discretion to allow reasonable extension of time limits for anything that is required to be done under the rules. It might wish to make special provisions for dealing with teachers already professionally certificated, but whose probation under the Secretary of State's rules is not yet complete, in other words, special cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the kinds of administrative filling out of the rules which would be completely covered by this paragraph, and would remove any possible doubt which there might be that the Council had power to make that kind of rule governing consequential, ancillary and incidental provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a similar provision in the rules relating to the Law Society. There is a difference here, of course, because the Lord President comes into the picture. Nevertheless, this particular filling out is a perfectly normal thing, and one example of it is the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am heartbroken that the hon. Lady has not seen fit to oblige me in this case and give us that joy to which we are all looking forward of having an Amendment accepted, because this is not an Amendment of earth-shaking importance, but I appreciate her courtesy in giving us such a long explanation of such a useless paragraph. I would remind the hon. Lady that in this Committee in the previous Parliament we listened long and often to her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State urging the Committee to cut out unnecessary verbiage in proposed legislation, and I suggest to her that she might profitably have a consultation with her right hon. Friend on that very subject. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is, of course, one of the most important Clauses of the Bill, and it has been very interesting that the bulk of the discussion has related to the additional particulars which may be prescribed by the Council in the establishment of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the moving of the last two Amendments I looked very carefully at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
Clause 11, under which the hon. Lady said it would be possible to discuss again the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) as to whether, when a person had had his name removed from the register for infamous conduct, and then had it restored, these particulars would be put on the register and would be put out in the certified extract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read Clause 11, it seems to me that it is impossible to discuss this question there, because there is no reference to the register at all. Clause 10 deals with the application of a person for the restoration of his name in the register. This seems to be the only place at which it will be in order once again to discuss the matter. Will the hon. Lady therefore give a definite reply to the question raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) as to whether or not, when the name of a teacher has been removed from the register for infamous conduct and has later been restored, that fact is contained in the particulars included in the register? When she replied to the point before she said that she assumed that it would not be. In Committee we are entitled to have a definite statement of fact, and by now she may be able to give a definite answer, having taken advantage of the legal advice at her disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point concerns the question whether, if a person is not registered, he can still teach. Paragraph 128 of the Wheatley Report says that while the Committee recommends
	<br><blockquote><p>"that registration with the Council be obligatory on all teachers who wish to claim entitlement to the benefits conferred by certified status"</p></blockquote>
it did not see the need for registration to extend beyond the present scope of certification. The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot recommend in present circumstances that it should be an offence for an unregistered person to be employed in teaching."</p></blockquote>
Since this is not written into the Bill we ought to be given an assurance by the hon. Lady that this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also be interested to know if the hon. Lady can estimate, on present figures, how many teachers are likely to register, how many would be fully qualified under Scottish standards, and how
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
many would have non-Scottish qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point concerns paragraph 129 of the Wheatley Report, which lays it down that a single register of qualified teachers should be divided
	<br><blockquote><p>"only into those who are provisionally registered and those who are finally registered,"</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will, of course, be for the Council itself to suggest changes in the basis of registration for the future."</p></blockquote>
I would have thought, therefore, that the point raised by one or two members during our discussion, as to the great power conferred on the Council by the Clause, is not a valid one, because we must read this Clause in conjunction with Clause 7, under which any recommendation by the Council as to the type of person who should be registered under Clause 6, or what sort of qualification he should have, must be placed before the Secretary of State, who can, under Clause 7, accept the recommendation as it stands, or alter it—with or without agreement—or reject it altogether. Although the Clause taken by itself appears to give the Council considerable power in deciding who shall be registered it does not really do so, as is shown if we read Clause 7 with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to paragraph 130 of the Wheatley Report, which points out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A particular problem arises over the position of some teachers employed in further education centres who, although they do not possess a Teacher's Certificate, nevertheless have qualifications approved for permanent appointment. We consider that the question of their inclusion in a register is a matter which should engage the attention of the Teaching Council at an early stage."</p></blockquote>
Can the hon. Lady give us her views on this recommendation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I hope that public positions wil not be taken up outside the House on the question of such matters as the proposal for a four-year associateship course in colleges of education. During the last few days we have all read letters in favour of or against such a proposal, and I would have thought that it was for the Council, once established, to consider all the questions for and against the proposal without the necessity for protagonists to rush into print or to write letters rejecting or supporting the proposal. The general supply question of teachers in Scotland demands new atti-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
tudes and an ability to change, and if this can be done we may yet go a long way towards meeting the supply position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. It appears to me, Mr. Brewis, that the speech of the hon. Lady went very wide. It covered matters which arise particularly on Clauses 7 and 8. Do I take it that you will rule that, as we have already covered these points, there must be no repetition of them when we reach on each of those Clauses the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Lady was out of order in making passing reference to Clause 7 or Clause 11, but I would deprecate going over all the discussions we have already had on the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wittingly or unwittingly hon. Members opposite have attempted to create dismay and despair in the minds of teachers as to the nature of the entries in the proposed register. I am sure that in their hearts they know that whatever entries are made—and there will be a minimum number—they will all be geared to the interests of the teachers themselves. Ample safeguards are built into the matter, in the membership and composition of the Council, and this will ensure that only questions which are relevant to the teaching ability of an individual seeking registration are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) knows a great deal more than most of us about the contents of the medical register. I am sure that she makes a study of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that the hon. Lady is so competent to speak on the contents of the medical register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether I should be in order if I took up that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, however, that the hon. Lady does not rush daily into the Library of the House of Commons to study the entries against her husband in order to discover whether he has undergone an operation for an appendectomy, or is suffering from tonsillitis. I am sure she does not go there to see whether the entries are changed from day to day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
Nevertheless, she has tried to create the impression that the proposed teaching register will follow the detailed events throughout a teacher's lifetime—that it will be a complete record of everything that has happened to him, mentally or physically, from the time when he left the college of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I wanted to refer to the details of any doctor I could not do so. The document to which the hon. Member refers is held by the B.M.A., and made available only to the members of the British Medical Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly indebted to the hon. Lady for at last confessing that the medical register contains a whole lot of details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not available, I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that it is not available for general inspection. We have not reached the stage of deciding who will be able to inspect the register of teachers, but at least she has conceded that in the compilation of the register of the British Medical Association it has gone far beyond what the Teaching Council will seek to incorporate in its register. At the commencement of an individual's teaching career there will simply be the requisite minimum entry regarding his fitness to teach. That will not be under constant review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge any hon. Member to cite any professional register in which the suggestions that have been made by hon. Members opposite are followed in practice, in reviewing such a register from the angle at which it has been suggested that the teaching council register will be reviewed. The hon. Lady suggested that if, perhaps in the middle of a teacher's career, he or she suffered a mental breakdown, that fact would be recorded in the register if that teacher subsequently returned to the teaching profession. Of course it will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but that was the impression that she conveyed. She instanced the case of a teacher who had had a mental breakdown subsequent to his registration, and wondered whether
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
that fact would be incorporated in the register, or included in an extract taken from the register. That was her argument, and we can only conclude that she had in mind the possibility that teachers would be in duty bound to report every illness occurring in their lifetimes so that the teaching register could be kept up to date. Every hon. Member knows that the register will contain simply those minimal facts such as are contained in the registers kept by many other professional organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that we may have added a little fuel to the arguments of hon. Members opposite by the use, in subsection (4,	<i>c</i>), of the words, "the issue of certified extracts". It might have been better if the Clause had said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Council to issue a certificate of registration."</p></blockquote>
The word "extract" denotes something which is not an entire entry but is limited to a narrower field of information. I feel that it would be sufficient to say that once an entry has been registered a duty is laid upon the Council to issue a certificate of registration in whatever prescribed form the Council may deem fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite have made heavy weather of this provision. Despite what they have said, they know that all the fantastic possibilities which they have suggested in respect of details which could be included in the register would never be considered by the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several points which I should like to answer. First of all, there were those put by the noble Lady on the question of what would happen to the entry in the register if a teacher were subject to discipline under Clause 11. This, surely, is quite clear, as I think I was beginning to indicate when we realised that the discussion of Clause 11 would go beyond our discussions on this Clause. If the teacher were subject to discipline he would just go off the register. He would then come on the register after it was decided that he could do so. The register would not contain any details of the disciplinary procedure during which he had been absent. He would simply be off the register and then back on the register. I hope that reassures the noble Lady on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the fact that he had been on the register, off the register, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
then restored to the register, be recorded in the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The date of registration would probably be on the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be self-evident, in other words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of unregistered teachers, the noble Lady quoted paragraph 128 of the Wheatley Report when she asked about this matter. She will recognise that a little earlier in the paragraph that she quoted the Wheatley Committee said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore recommend that registration with the Council be obligatory on all teachers who wish to claim entitlement to the benefits conferred by certificated status."</p></blockquote>
I think this is really the answer to her point. I accept that in this respect the Clause is a relatively limited one. It makes it an offence for someone to hold himself out falsely to be registered when he is not registered, or to seek registration by means of any false representations. I would not want to anticipate the debate which we might have on another Amendment on the Paper, and if I went too far into this I might be in danger of doing so. What happens here is simply that the Secretary of State has powers in making regulations under Section 1 of the 1962 Act to ensure that where certificated teachers are available in sufficient quantities they, and they only, should be employed, and I think his powers there are sufficient at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lady asked about the number of registered and unregistered teachers. It is difficult to say how many teachers we would expect to be registered in the future, without going into a long discussion of the supply situation and I do not think that I should be in order in doing that on this Clause. The total number of certificated teachers at present, as the noble Lady will know, is about 40,000, and of course the number is increasing all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as exceptional cases are concerned—and the noble Lady asked in particular about teachers outside Scotland—one can get a guide from past numbers of exceptional admissions of those teachers from the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers has recommended should be given exceptional recognition by the Secretary of State. In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
1959 there were 125 recommendations; in 1960, 173; in 1961, 190; in 1962, 199; in 1963, 236; and in 1964, 282. This has been the number of exceptional admissions, and although the figures would include some teachers in addition to those who were teachers with some degree of English training they are nevertheless a reasonable guide in answer to the question which the noble Lady asked. It is the only fact that one has available. One does not have a breakdown any further than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend tell me whether the 40,000, to which she referred, applies to day school teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the number of teachers who are certificated at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 130 of the Wheatley Report, as the noble Lady said, raises the question of teachers employed in further education centres, and she asked what would be the Secretary of State's attitude on this and what he proposed to do. She will recognise that the Wheatley Report suggests that the question of whether or not they should be included in the register is a matter which should engage the attention of the Teaching Council at an early stage. We really have to regard this as one of those matters which one hopes the General Teaching Council, when it is set up, would consider at a fairly early stage. I would not regard it as a matter on which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would wish to declare a view at this point. He would wish this to be a matter for consideration by the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lady also made some remarks about the discussion in the Press recently on the proposals for an associateship course. I think she will recognise that as this is before the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers, which, when it reaches some conclusions, will, no doubt, be telling my right hon. Friend what they are, it would not be appropriate for me to comment at the moment. Therefore I would rather not follow her in her remarks on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) looked back at the wording of the Clause and I shall certainly take note of what he said in his comments there. In considering the Question, That the Clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
stand part of the Bill, we are not, of course, looking back at the detailed wording of it, but, nevertheless, I was interested in what he said, and I certainly shall read very carefully the comments he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that, I think I have covered all the points which were raised on this Question. We have had a rather lengthy discussion on some very necessary and some, perhaps, slightly unnecessary fears, but with that we seem to have satisfied most of the Members that the Clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 7. (REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOMMENDATION FOR REGISTRATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the next Amendment, No. 60, it may be convenient to take No. 61 as well, in page 4, line 16, leave out "and fitness to teach".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 16, after "education" to insert "and".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two Amendments raise the matter which was raised on the wording of Clause 2(1). They raise it even more sharply, because what Parliament is saying here is that the Secretary of State shall have power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make regulations prescribing the requirements as to education, training and fitness to teach."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to take up the time of the Committee by going over all the lengthy arguments we had before about "fitness to teach". May I just say that I can understand how the Secretary of State could lay down regulations with regard to educational requirements? These are readily understood, easily defined and capable of regulation in this way. I can also understand how it is perfectly possible for the Secretary of State in advance to lay down regulations prescribing the training required of teachers who are going to satisfy the requirements for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I cannot see how the Secretary of State can lay down in advance regulations dealing with so vague and essentially personal characteristics as would be bound up with the phrase "fitness to teach". For the reason that the words
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
"fitness to teach", or such words, are entirely appropriate, for example, in Clause 6(2,	<i>c</i>) it seems to me that they are entirely inappropriate in Clause 7(1), because in Clause 6(2,	<i>c</i>) the Council is being given discretionary power to decide in any individual case whether an applicant has the necessary qualifications, and is fit to teach by reason both of his fitness to teach and his experience. These are essential qualifications which will vary from individual case to individual case. They are intimately linked with the use of a residual and discretionary power on the part of the selecting body. I have the greatest difficulty in understanding what kind of regulations the Secretary of State would make under that general concept, and it seems to me that these words should not form part of this subsection for the reasons I have given today, and for the reasons which were adduced at some length when these words were criticised earlier in our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot remember now whether or not the hon. Lady said in relation to Clause 2 that she was going to reconsider the Amendment relating to fitness to teach, but I hope, if she did not give any such undertaking at that stage, that she will give now an undertaking in this connection on this Clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can probably save the time of the Committee at this point by recollecting what I did say on the Amendment to Clause 2, to which the hon. and learned Gentleman has referred. What I said was that the Government would consider the possible rephrasing of the general expression "education, training and fitness to teach", and on that understanding hon. Members opposite withdrew their Amendment. Clearly, it is desirable that a uniform expression should appear throughout the Bill where it is appropriate that it should do so. Therefore I should be very happy to look at this expression here, along with the expression in Clause 2, on the assumption that the expressions should be uniform in both parts of the Bill. I hope that will meet the hon. and learned Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only possible way to deal with this matter. It is most appropriate that it should be dealt with in that way, since the words used come into both Clauses. I am entirely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
satisfied with the hon. Lady's undertaking on the matter. Accordingly, on the understanding that the Amendment will be reconsidered as the hon. Lady has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 21, to leave out "consider" and to insert "have regard to".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient also to take Amendment No. 63, in page 4, line 41, leave out "consider any" and insert "have regard to".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Brewis, for agreeing that we should discuss Amendment No. 63 with this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have very real hopes at long last that the hon. Lady will accept both these Amendments; and if she has any wish to be consistent with her previous attitudes on this Bill I feel sure that she will do so. The purpose of these Amendments is to substitute in subsection (2) the words "have regard to any relevant recommendation" for the words "consider any relevant recommendation", and to do the same in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that when we discussed Clause 4 we discussed whether it was necessary to have it at all, because we could not conceive of a situation where the Secretary of State would not have regard to any recommendations made to him by the Council. However, after considerable debate the hon. Lady gave various reasons why she felt it was essential that Clause 4 should remain and why it should be clearly stated that the Secretary of State should "have regard to" any recommendation. We must be consistent for the benefit of future generations who will, I hope, eventually read the Act, and it may well be that those with acute legal minds will come along and look at Clause 7 and say, "Now what is meant by the fact that instead of having the words 'have regard to' we have the word 'consider'? Does it mean that the Secretary of State does not really have to pay quite so much attention to the recommendations which are made to him, as it is definitely laid down in Clause 4 that he has to 'have regard to' these recommendations?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at what it is that the Secretary of State has to consider or have regard to we see they are very important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
considerations indeed, because the whole of this Clause 7 refers to the requirements for recommendation for registration, and under subsection (2) the Secretary of State "shall"—this is a duty placed on him—"before making regulations … consider" or have regard to "any relevant recommendation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (4),
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Secretary of State proposes to make regulations under this section otherwise than in consequence of a relevant recommendation he shall, before publishing a draft thereof in pursuance of section 144(2) of the Act of 1962, afford to the Council an opportunity to consider the draft and shall consider any representations made by them."</p></blockquote>
If, as the hon. Lady said, it was so necessary to have Clause 4 in the Bill in order to make sure that the Secretary of State fulfilled his duty, I suggest that we should substitute in subsection (4) of this Clause the words "have regard to" for the word "consider". That would ensure consistency, and clarity for future generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Clause deals with the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations describing the qualifications to be fulfilled for registration. In subsection (2) he is required to consider any relevant recommendations by the Council and to give effect to them unless he considers it inexpedient to do so. In subsection (4) the Secretary of State is required, if he is to make regulations on his own initiative, to consider any representations made by the Council on the draft of the regulations.

The point at issue is the question of the use of English. The hon. Lady says that I must be consistent since I argued on Clause 4 that the Secretary of State should have regard to recommendations made to him by the Council. She says that it would be consistent if we used the words "have regard to" in this context. Her argument astonishes me because she voted against Clause 4 and did not think then the Secretary of State should have regard to matters of this kind. To find her now arguing that he should "have regard to" relevant recommendations is a little extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless the real argument here is that, when he is about to act on a matter, then "consider"—in line 21—really does seem to be the right word because the Secretary of State will consider something and, unless he considers it to be inexpedient, he will give effect to the recommendations. The word "consider" in this context would seem to imply that he will reach a balanced judgment on the recommendations before him, deciding either to give effect to them or not. In one's judgment on the use of English—and I am sure that we all wish that we had 	<i>Fowler</i> here, for he would be of help, but no one ever produces him in Committee—it seems to me that "consider" is the right word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment is to line 41, and here the position is a little different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
It would be reasonable to say in line 41 that the Secretary should "have regard to" any recommendations that are being made by the Council. I think that would be the correct use of English and an improvement on the Bill. I therefore accept the Amendment to line 41.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Lady said that she would accept one Amendment and reject the other I thought she would accept the first and reject the second. That is the course I would have followed. This is, I suppose, quibbling about words. It is not correct to say that we opposed Clause 4 because we did not consider that the Secretary of State should "have regard to" recommendations. If I remember it rightly, we objected because it was not necessary to tell the Secretary of State to have regard to recommendations of a body which he himself had set up and one of the purposes of which was to make him recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a narrow point but I think that "have regard to" would be the appropriate wording in Clause 7(2). It is recommendations which are being considered here, just as it was recommendations that were being considered on Clause 4. Although he is to take immediate action in the second case and perhaps not in the first case, it does not appear to me that that is a valid distinction between the phraseology appropriate in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will reconsider. I would much prefer her to accept the first Amendment and reject the second than adopt the course she has decided upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to thank the hon. Lady at any rate for seeing fit to accept one Amendment. It shows that, at long last, we have got her to understand that one must not come to the Committee with a mind completely made up but must listen to arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When she talked about the first Amendment she said that she thought that "consider" was better because the Secretary of State had to exercise what she called his "balanced judgment". I would have thought that he would also have to exercise his balanced judgment in the second case, too, and I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands

(Mr. Wylie) (therefore, that it really would be advisable for her to accept both Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may be so bold as to say that I am sure she is surrounded by the most expert legal advice behind the scenes, although, of course we do not have the benefit of having either the Lord Advocate or the Solicitor-General for Scotland in our Committee—a point made so strongly by hon. Members opposite when they were in Opposition—and therefore we understand why she must rely very heavily on advice behind the scenes. With due respect to my hon. and learned Friend, sometimes those with learned minds do have a field day. I can remember myself trying to resist those very legal minds who advise the hon. Lady. It was on the question whether that great word "heretofore" should or should not be used in a Bill. I wished to have it removed, but I had quite a battle behind the scenes because they wished it to stand and be in the Statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Lady that she consider it wise to look again at her approach to the first Amendment in view of her decision to accept the second. Perhaps laymen, who also have to read the Bill, might consider there was something inconsistent in having "consider" in one place but "have regard to" in another, bearing in mind that she felt it was necessary to "have regard to" representations under Clause 4. While I thank her for accepting the second Amendment, I hope she will reconsider her decision on the first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find myself in some difficulty as to what I am being asked to do by the hon. Lady and the hon. and learned Gentleman. I have two Amendments before me. I am prepared to accept the second. The hon. and learned Gentleman would rather I accepted the first.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has come to a very wise decision. She is going to apply the phrase "have regard to" in line 41 and is keeping "consider" in line 21, where it refers to "any relevant recommendation". Relevant recommendations going to the Secretary of State may be tremendously important documents and he will not approach them or have regard to them using harsh words. He will take the attitude of a judge when he says that he must retire to consider the case. The judge does not retire to "have regard to" the case. The Secretary of State has to take a decision of great importance and these relevant recommendations will be of great importance. He will retire to his appropriate chair, chin in hand—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will retain "consider". She has said that she is prepared to accept the second Amendment, "have regard to". The Secretary of State will have considered the draft and must have reached some sort of conclusion about the matter, and when he comes to the representations after considering the draft very deeply, as Scottish Secretaries of State always do, he will decide that he will have to have regard to the representations made. The language here has been excellently used. It describes the attitude which Ministers will take to these important recommendations, drafts and representations made to them. It is adequate language used in the proper place and I hope that my hon. Friend will stick to her decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even before she starts her answer, I will hazard a guess that the hon. Lady will say that these words are unnecessary. I shall resist the temptation to say that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I have already suggested that many words used in the Bill are unnecessary; but here I am with a modest four little words to add to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to try to persuade the hon. Lady that these words, or words like them, are essential. I regard these Amendments as of great importance. The Bill sets up a Council of very great distinction and influence. The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Scotland has gone to a good deal of trouble in his consideration of the Wheatley Report to pick representatives of the whole of the teaching profession, elected by the profession, representatives of the universities and of the training colleges, and so on. This distinguished Council is to be set up to consider and make representations to the Secretary of State on certain matters of vital professional interest and importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in addition we are to give to the Secretary of State what is virtually the right to veto these recommendations. The Council can make recommendations but it is up to the Secretary of State himself to decide whether to act on them. By these Amendments I am trying to underline that in exercising the rights which the Bill seeks to confer on him the Secretary of State should have regard to matters extrinsic to the profession itself. Matters of a professional nature should be the prerogative of this erudite, influential and representative Council, which will have given great thought to these professional matters, and those thoughts should not be negatived by the Secretary of State, except for some reason outside the interests of the profession. There may be matters of great public importance unconnected with teaching which make it necessary for the Secretary of State to act in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not for a moment suggest that even the present Secretary of State would act contrary to the public interest. The present Secretary of State must be considering something, although I do not know what he is considering, because we never see him. However, we must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that, wherever he is, his great considerations will be in the public interest. The purpose of the Amendments is not to suggest that he would exercise his extraordinary powers other than in the public interest, but to underline that he should have regard to matters of public interest which are completely extrinsic to the profession itself, and not try to ride roughshod over the considered opinions of a body of the type to be set up under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In these three Amendments we have a glaring example, starkly brought into relief by the speech of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), of how the Tory mind works, how it functions, how suspicious it is. The whole philosophy of the Tories is that they cater to sectional interests. It is because of their inherent belief in the importance of catering to sectional interests that they are suspicious that a Labour Secretary of State would act in the same way. The interests for which a Labour Secretary of State would cater would be completely different from those for which the Tories would cater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West proposes to insert the words "in the public interest" after the word "inexpedient". I would like to hear the view of hon. Members on the Front Bench opposite about the Amendments. I notice that their names are not associated with them. I do not know whether this means that there is a rift in the camp and that the back benchers are trying to lead the Front Bench. It will be interesting to see what develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite wrong to include these words, "in the public interest". It would be completely wrong to act as though we believed that my right hon. Friend would not act in the public interest but would cater for sectional interests, of the teaching or any other profession. My right hon. Friend is obviously trying to perfect the Teaching Council in order to improve Scottish education in the public interest. It is not that we are catering for the teaching profession as such. We are looking after the interests of teachers in order to equip the teachers better to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
perform the duties which we ask them to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not for a moment believe that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will think of accepting the Amendments, but I hope that she will repudiate them as strongly as I have and show that we do not believe that a Labour Secretary of State will in any circumstances act other than in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much pleasure in supporting the Amendment so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). There are two things which greatly surprised me when I first read this Clause. The first is a fundamental consideration which was mentioned at Second Reading—the proposal to give the Secretary of State the right to make regulations on his own initiative. This is a fundamental change from the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee, and it is surprising that, throughout our discussions, we have had no explanation of this major change in policy, a change which somewhat reduces the status and powers which we are prepared to give to the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is the use of the word "inexpedient". One of the problems of the profession in Scotland is that far too many decisions have been taken because of expediency—and perhaps there are some which have not been taken because of expediency—even when such a course of action has not necessarily been in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It did not escape my attention that in an earlier discussion it was said that the Council would be greatly concerned with the point of view of the teachers. The Council will be very representative of teachers. It is not wise to include the word "inexpedient" in a Bill of this kind. There may be a legal reason for using the word "inexpedient".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman try to define his use of the word "expediency"? His uses of "inexpediency" and "expediency" do not seem to gel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a layman who has had something to do with bringing into operation legal matters connected with the teaching profession, in my association with local government. I have found the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
relationship between "expediency" and "inexpediency" to be entirely insubstantial. It may be fairer to my hon. Friends and to the hon. Member to say I was trying to make out what I meant without precisely defining what I had in mind. Because we are all in this difficulty. Scottish Members are in a difficulty because of the absence of the Law Officers. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West spotlighted this difficulty last night in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now discussing an Amendment which is concerned with what the Secretary of State is to do, although the Secretary of State is not present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite in order to refer to the absence of my right hon. Friend. He is not a Member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. That is the point I was trying to make. I was not making a personal reflection on the right hon. Gentleman by suggesting that he was disregarding his duties, but merely pointing out that he was not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his absence if is only right, when we are discussing a question which would cover a legal condition—and to that extent it is particularly inappropriate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has nothing to do with a legal condition. It is a matter of English. The hon. Gentleman has used the word "expediency" as opposed to "inexpediency". This is not a legal matter but a matter of English. I do not understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to argue from the point of view of the use of English and the meaning of words. I do not know to what the hon. Gentleman is taking exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are having to deal with a legal matter in the absence of the Law Officers. We have had this difficulty in the House. We on this side of the Committee believe that we have not had sufficient Parliamentary time devoted to a discussion of Scottish economic affairs. That is a side issue which was introduced by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have here the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless he considers it inexpedient to do so"</p></blockquote>
and it is essential that we should insert
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
the words, "in the public interest", because if the Secretary of State is going to make a change in a recommendation of this sort, one which stems from the Council, there should be weighty reasons for his doing so. Recommendations can be put forward by anyone in this country but they should be treated differently from recommendations put forward by the Council. If the Council puts forward specific recommendations after careful consideration—and let us remember this is a body which we hope will be one of high status and influence—there should be some weighty reasons for the Secretary of State making any change. To that extent, therefore, it is essential to put in some strong words to let the Secretary of State know that we consider that there should be great and weighty reasons for disregarding recommendations put forward by the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the phrase "in the public interest" is not the best one, but, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, some words must be included to make it clear to the Secretary of State that if he proposes to override or to change any recommendations made by the Council there must be real, relevant and weighty reasons for doing so. In my opinion the phrase "in the public interest" is the correct one. I think it is essential that a phrase of this kind should be included, to make it quite clear that there must be weighty reasons for overturning any recommendation made by the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only have I failed to understand a good deal of what was said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), but I think that he has failed to understand a good deal of what was said by his hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Amendment was not put forward to provide the Secretary of State with weighty reasons, but to demand that he should have weighty reasons before he accepted this. It was a specific point in which the hon. Gentleman was trying to make clear that the Secretary should only, as it were, interfere in those matters which did not concern teachers as a profession, but those matters which concerned their involvement in the public sector. In other words, the whole argument to back up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
the Amendment falls. It has nothing to do with producing weighty reasons. The fact that such a strong argument can be adduced for it suggests that the original Amendment must be loose and vague, and this, I think, is its difficulty. I do not think that it does the job which the hon. Gentleman is trying to make it do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be very careful in the use of these words "expediency" and "inexpediency". In its normal usage we use "expediency" when we compromise because we cannot carry out in full, at a particular moment of time, a policy of action. We therefore withdraw the full application of the action. That is expediency. But in the terms in which it was being used by the hon. Gentleman, to bring in the question of public interest, it means that which is in the public interest, that which is doing or is not doing something in the public interest, and I think that the hon. Gentleman was unnecessarily confusing the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there is such complete confusion in the minds of the hon. Gentlemen proposing and supporting the Amendment, there is something false in it, and it is this: having decided that it is not a teachers' council, but a Teaching Council, and having decided, therefore, that there is proper public concern over this body, and public involvement over this body, it becomes impossible to decide completely and absolutely those matters which are only in the interests of the profession, and those matters which are only in the interests of society. An obvious point is salaries, but of course we are not dealing with them. If it is decided that a teacher's pay should be increased, it affects society. It is not a matter solely for the teaching authority. Similarly, the question of entrance will decide the number of teachers who come in. That affects society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment falls because it does not achieve, first, what it sets out to achieve, and, secondly, because it cannot achieve what it sets out to do, because public interest and teacher involvement are far too integrated to be disentangled in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment stands in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), who has managed to enlist the support of one

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) is so anxious to display his political venom that he has unwisely rushed into this discussion. When he has been here for a little longer, perhaps he will learn to restrain himself and not give vent to his political prejudices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West is an old fox at this game, and it is disappointing to find young hon. Members being misled in matters like this. If the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West had his way he would bring into this Council all the practices of the legal profession. We know that discussions in the legal profession are at least semi-private, and are not always in the public interest. Teachers are public servants, paid out of public money. They are not hired in the way that some solicitors, and as some doctors, are. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would get it into his head that we are dealing with the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is gratuitous and offensive. It is meant to be offensive and insulting. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] It is insulting, and it is offensive, in the sense that when we have Conservative Ministers, it is said that they act in the public interest on every occasion, but when there is a change, there is a need for greater scrutiny. It is not we who have been trying to cabin, confine and constrain the activities of the Council. It is hon. Gentlemen opposite who have been trying to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the public interest must prevail. That is why the Wheatley Report said what it did. If the hon. Member for Cathcart wants some reassurance on this point perhaps he will read paragraph 102 of the Wheatley Report which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From what we have said it will appear that in regard to teachers' qualifications we have found it necessary to consider the public interest and the professional interest as separate entities. This is not to say that the two will necessarily often—or, indeed, ever—be in opposition to one another. But the possibility must be faced that they may not always coincide."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
If that is so, who will determine the public interest? Is it to be the teachers, or is it to be some other section of the community? The hon. Member for Cathcart claims to be a great democrat. If we are to follow democratic processes, the decision must rest with Parliament and with the Minister, and the Amendment is, therefore, gratuitous.

The hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) did not tell what view the Opposition Front Bench took of the Amendment. I hope that she will do so, because it strikes at the heart of the processes which we employ in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lady suggesting that the new Clause and the six Amendments in my name are not in my name? I have been called the hon. Member for Renfrew, East, and the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) has been called the hon. Member for Renfrew, West, but it is coming to a pretty pass if it is being suggested that the Amendments to which I have referred are not in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The point the hon. Member is raising is not a point of order. I think that we must get on with our discussion of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The hon. Lady started by saying that she was replying because of a challenge. Is she replying for the Front Bench, or for the back bench?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to reply when hon. Gentlemen opposite sought to raise points of order and thus delay the proceedings of the Committee, which must, I am afraid, be very annoying to the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), and also to the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire and the hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) answered the points which they put before the Committee, because I agree with both hon. Gentlemen that it is most desirable that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and hon. Ladies, too, should be able to put down Amendments in their own names, without the authority of the Front Benches. That is exactly what has happened in this case. I consider it very desirable that hon. Members should take enough interest—as is evidenced by the action of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and those who support him—to think out the Bill, to study it carefully, to consider how in their opinion the drafting can be improved, and to make selections from the English language which they feel does this correctly, and it is for this reason, as my hon. Friend said, that he moved the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that when my hon. Friend moved the Amendment he said that he was not suggesting that the Secretary of State would not act in the public interest, but he thought that it should be defined in an Act of Parliament. I assure the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire that my hon. Friends have no intention whatever of attacking a Labour Secretary of State because, if I may remind the Committee, when the Bill becomes an Act—if it is not delayed by hon. Gentlemen opposite—we hope that it will survive for many years to come, and with things going as they are at the moment, there will jolly soon be a Unionist Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
