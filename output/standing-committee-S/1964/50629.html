	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the privilege of replying to what I think will be the shortest and least controversial speech that we have heard from the Under-Secretary of State this Session. This is the first Estimates debate I have attended and it is also the first occasion upon which I have been asked to open a debate. It may, therefore, be prudent for me to apologise in advance to the Under-Secretary for any apparent breach in the Front Bench etiquette. I can think of no better words to do this than those used to me by a very burly centre forward who came from Greenock, in a football match some years ago. After up-ending me rather viciously in a football match he comforted me with the words, "I am so sorry; it is not intentional, except when I mean it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is concerned with the vital and human problem of local government finance and the rates burden. We have the advantage that many Members on this Committee have had the recent experience of serving as members of local government bodies. It must be apparent to everyone that the massive post-war increase in local spending and the new circumstances created by revaluation in 1961 have made finance the most acute
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
and serious problem of local government today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last nine years we have had a dramatic advance in education and housing production and in almost every single field of local government activity the advances have involved an increase of about 100 per cent. in the total local government spending in Scotland. In less than a decade the amount gathered in rates has increased from less than £60 million to over £111 million. Under the revaluation of 1961 the average share of the domestic ratepayer declined from 60 per cent. to about 52½ per cent. This change was by no means equal throughout the country, and the element of hardship did not decrease, despite this apparent reduction. The burden of the rates at present is a massive one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the cities alone, in Glasgow at the present time the average man, woman and child carries a rate burden, direct or indirect, of £27 3s. 1ld. This means about £100 for the average family which they pay on the house they live in or in the prices in the shops or through the firms and factories in which they work. In Edinburgh the figure is £23 9s. which is substantially below Glasgow for no apparent reason. In Aberdeen the figure is £24 7s. and in Dundee £22 5s. I think we can gauge the hardship involved by these figures when we consider the amounts of rates in arrears. The most recent figure for Glasgow was 2·37 per cent. in arrears, which means that at the last count there were over £650,000 arrears of rates in the City of Glasgow. Glasgow was by no means the county with the highest percentage: the highest I can find is Ross and Cromarty where there are around 4 per cent. arrears of rates. These figures are from the 	<i>Rating Review,</i> and they show clearly that the rating burden involves a great deal of hardship because many people simply cannot afford to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industry and commerce also bear a mighty load of rates and I hope the Secretary of State will look carefully at all the available information before he seeks to take an easy way out of this problem by abolishing derating next year. One Scottish company already paying more than £1½ million in rates recently did a survey of comparable firms in England and Scotland. It had the professional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

assistance of one of the local assessors and it found that the basis of assessment with the Scottish and English firms was approximately the same, with Scotland perhaps a little higher, but it found the actual rate poundage burden in England among these firms was less than half that in Scotland which means that all things remaining equal, and they certainly will not be exactly equal, when derating goes it will mean that for every £1 in rates paid in England the Scottish firms will pay approximately £2 10s. There are many firms affected in the same way. Some of the Scottish shipyards have to allow more than £10,000 in the cost of one ship for the burden of rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Faced with this hardship the previous Government appointed the Allen Committee to look into the incidence of the rates burden. Now we have this Report we see that one of the principal findings is that in Scotland ratepayers are having a pretty rough time. In paragraph 215 of the Report we have:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The average rate payment in Scotland is greater than in England and Wales as a whole for all income groups, and very considerably so."</p></blockquote>
Later, in paragraph 217, this is put in a clearer and more specific way, when the Report states that in Scotland rates comprise about 50 per cent. of housing costs in every income group compared with between 28 per cent. or 30 per cent. in England and Wales as a whole. While we were waiting for this Report the previous Administration passed the Rating (Interim Relief) Act to give local authorities the power to remit rates in cases of hardship. In Scotland local authorities have had this power for a long time, and for that reason provision was made for an additional £1 million in the Scottish General Grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone appreciated this could only be a stopgap measure because it in no way solved the fundamental problems of the rating system in so far as it affected Scotland. That is why the previous Administration set in motion the review of the relationship between rates and grants. Local authorities in Scotland were very hopeful that something useful would come out of this review because they appreciated it was a feasible proposition for a Government which had reduced general taxation so greatly in these 13
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
good years, in terms of transferring part of the burden from the ratepayer to the national Exchequer. Income Tax was brought down from 9s. 6d. to 7s. 9d., the Purchase Tax maximum rate from 100 per cent. to 25 per cent. and the general burden of taxation on the national income brought from over 30 per cent. to less than 25 per cent. Local authorities could, therefore, regard this transferring of part of the burden from the ratepayer to the Exchequer as something feasible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we possibly think of such a possibility from a Government who in seven months have increased the burden of general taxation so greatly? Unfortunately, and perhaps tragically, we did not have the opportunity of carrying out these proposals. As is only too obvious from the composition of this Committee a new Government were elected. If nothing else confirms this, it is abundantly clear, from the simple issue of local government finance, that this present Government were elected reluctantly and with a threadbare majority on the basis of irresponsible and wild promises which have since been flagrantly and cynically broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must have been many members of my party, many of our traditional supporters, who were tempted to jump on the Socialist bandwagon by the clear and specific promises which were given to give early relief from problems of rating in Scotland. Their manifesto, the 	<i>New Britain,</i> gave the impression that these problems would be solved with the speed of an agile antelope but instead we have had the tired tortoise steadily and deliberately stepping backwards over a period of seven months. If hon. Members opposite question this I think we should look at the extent of the commitment in the Election manifesto, the 	<i>New Britain.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 13 of the manifesto says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the reform of the rating system and an investigation of alternative methods of local government finance may take some time to accomplish, we shall seek to give early relief to ratepayers by transferring a larger part of the burden of public expenditure from local authorities to the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
On page 14, talking about the massive leap forward in education which we were to have, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To assure the funds, Labour will restore the percentage grant and transfer the larger part of the costs of teachers' salaries from the rates to the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
On page 15:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Labour will introduce a policy of lower interest rates for housing."</p></blockquote>
There we have three particular assurances, and we have seen no signs of their materialising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was the publication of Scotland's own manifesto, 	<i>Signposts for Scotland,</i> and here the message was just as clear and specific. On page 20 it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Exchequer will carry a larger share of the financial responsibility for education."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"While our long-term plans for local government finance are being worked out local authorities will be given immediate inducements both to step up the housing programmes and make greater use of their powers".</p></blockquote>
On page 18:
	<br><blockquote><p>I note the manifesto says "immediate" and not "early." How long is early and how long is immediate? I hope the Under-Secretary of State will give us an indication of precisely what the Government mean by the words "immediate" and the word "early", and how precisely are these pledges to be honoured by a Government who have already made savage increases in general taxation.</p></blockquote>
Where is the money to be found? From the road tolls defined as indefensible in page 10 of 	<i>Signposts?</i> from the slashing of investment allowances which were going to be increased according to page 8 of the same document. Or is it from higher loan charges on housing which were going to be slashed, according to page 18? These promises cannot lightly be laughed away, because it is to them that the present Government owe their shaky existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to say that the Government have done nothing to deal with the problems of local government finance. A great deal has been done, and I think the ratepayers of Scotland will suffer the consequences within the next few months. Apart from their indifference to election pledges the Government have shown amazing ignorance as to the effects of their own policies. In the General Grant debate on 15th December the Minister of Housing suggested that rates in England and Wales would probably go up by 6 or 7 per cent. Later, in May, he admitted they would go up by more than 10 per cent. We expected better things for Scotland. We expected a more exact estimate and we had one. On 4th
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
April, at Question Time the Under-Secretary of State said that rates in Scotland would rise this year by about 4 per cent., which would add 30s. to the burden of the average ratepayer. This Government have already produced a Mr. Three Per Cent. and in my mind the Under-Secretary will always be Mr. Four Per Cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened in the two short months since them? We have only had two authorities declare their rates for the next year and we still have the worst ones to come although there have been many grim warnings from the major cities and counties as to what is going to happen. Dunbarton County Council is making no 4 per cent. increase nor a 5 or 6 per cent., but a massive 1s. 6d. increase in rates which is more than 7 per cent. On Thursday last we had the announcement by the Burgh of Greenock, which may be known to some Members opposite. When I contacted the Scottish Office yesterday they had not been advised of the actual increase, but from information which I have no reason to doubt, because it comes from the hard-pressed ratepayers of Greenock, I understand that the rates there increased by no less than 1s. 9d. to a record 25s. This increase was not 4 per cent. but about double that amount. I am glad to have the opportunity of advising the Under-Secretary of this latest increase. The worst is still to come, and I think it is clear from figures we have that the rates increase in Scotland will be much more than 4 per cent., probably of the order of 8 per cent. When are we going to have the early relief and the immediate inducements which were promised by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What have the Government done on the capital side of local government spending? This is the most vital part of the problem. When I was a member of the Glasgow Corporation I remember hearing time and time again from the City Treasurer, now the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan), that capital spending was the real problem of local government, because this was building up trouble for the future. At present, according to the 	<i>Rating Review,</i> local authorities in Scotland have, or had last month, a capital debt of £958 million. The figure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
must now exceed £1,000 million. Specially low interest rates for local authorities would, therefore, be of immense value, because a reduction of 1 per cent. in the average interest payments for local authorities could mean a saving of £10 million, or 2s. in the rates. This would be an enormous saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, however, we have not had any such luck. Instead, we have had the longest ever period of 7 per cent. Bank Rate, culminating in a phoney reduction to 6 per cent., which means little if anything to local authorities. Just after the announcement of the reduction to 6 per cent., we had the latest local authority loan by the City of Swansea with a coupon of 6¾ per cent. issued below par. In the interim, local authorities have had to pay the highest price ever, round about 9 per cent., for short-term loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about grants? This was the obvious way for the Government to transfer part of the burden if they really wanted to. If they meant to carry out their Election pledge of transferring part of the burden from the ratepayer to the Exchequer, the simplest and obvious way was to do it by means of the general grant. When the announcement came of what the Government had in mind for the next two years, however, we had a general grant which carried exactly the same proportion of local government spending as in previous years. At the time, the Government tried to cover this up by mentioning an extra £1·2 million which they were to give in the second year. If we investigate this, it becomes clear that it is nothing new and is no concession whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the general grant in England and Wales the hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Pargiter) made it clear that that was no concession and that it was merely taking into account what had happened time and time again in previous two-year periods, namely, that in the second year there was a substantial increase in local government spending through no fault of the local authorities. This was always compensated for by later measures introduced to increase the general grant. The Government have simply decided to make this move a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
little earlier. We have, however, had no increase in the proportion of local government spending which is borne by the Exchequer. Where is the early relief and when are we to get it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, local authorities in Scotland will pay dearly for the 6d. per gallon increase in the price of petrol, and many of their vehicles now carry the extra 50 per cent. licence duty. The 33⅓ per cent. increase in postal charges will seriously worsen the already serious plight of local authorities, and an increase of 3s. 3d. in the National Insurance contributions will seriously hit local authorities like Glasgow, which has more than 46,000 employees. At that time, the City Treasurer in Glasgow estimated that the Labour Government would cost Glasgow an extra £200,000 or so, and this was before the most serious measures came forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from that, the general increase in prices during these seven months, coming to just under 5 per cent., will greatly increase the burden of local authorities and must inevitably lead to a substantial increase in the rate burden. Many of the essential items in local government budgets have been substantially increased while even the new import surcharges are also having their effect. If all these things are the culmination of the early relief which we expect from the Socialists, I fear what the prospect will be when we have a major review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, should the Government do? First, they must bring an end to the senseless and foolish economic policies which are crippling enterprise in the nation and which are having a serious effect on local government finance. Secondly, they must indicate clearly and precisely how and when they will take steps, if not to redeem their election pledges, at least to make good the damage which they have caused in these seven disastrous months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Government must ensure that spendthrift local authorities are restrained from further excesses. At a time when local government finance faces a crisis in Scotland we do not expect the Secretary of State for Scotland to approve such ridiculous escapades as the recent uninvited jaunt of one of the city councillors to America to hear his city engineer make a speech. Any waste and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
extravagance at such a time must be ruthlessly rooted out. The Secretary of State certainly has a responsibility here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, justice and equity must be brought into municipal housing finance. There is no question about this. This is a matter which we have pressed over and over again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who has no axe to grind in Glasgow, may I ask whether the hon. Member would not agree with the principle that it is a good thing that members of Scottish local authorities can travel abroad to see what other people are doing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never denied that at any time, but some of the increases which we have had are so obvious, blatant and wasteful that something must be done. When the question of a rates review in Glasgow was recently considered, it was found that we simply did not have enough members to make a decision because so many were outside the city and outside the country. I feel, therefore, that the time for action certainly has come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the question of local government finance for housing. When we have in Scotland a situation in which only 40 per cent. of the total cost of local authority housing is being borne by the people who live in these houses, we have come to a stage when early action is called for. My right hon. and hon. Friends will be dealing with this aspect of the matter in greater detail. Surely, the principle should be accepted that subsidies should be given to only those in need and to nobody else. The scandals which we have had in Glasgow, Dundee and Dunbartonshire must never be allowed to recur. I hope that we have resolute action from the Secretary of State and from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, and perhaps finally, the Government and all right hon. and hon. Members opposite must steel themselves to the retribution which their broken promises and wretched policies have so richly deserved. We heard from the Prime Minister in Glasgow only on Saturday that in the meantime the party opposite fears to face the electorate. But it certainly cannot run away for ever. The day of reckoning will certainly come, and for Scotland's sake I hope that it will come soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should very much like to congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on a remarkably good swashbuckling speech, completely uninhibited by fact and, therefore, arriving at conclusions which, no doubt, the hon. Member found fortifying to his side of the Committee. As to the hon. Gentleman's reference to me, I know my constituency intimately and I have known about the rate position for a long time. Indeed, we thought last year that under the Conservatives the rise this year might be 4s. and not 1s. 9d. The fact is that in the dying years of the official Opposition's period of office, in 1963–64 the average rise in rates in Scotland was 7·9 per cent. and in 1964–65 it was 6·8 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was 3d. in Greenock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 7· per cent. in Greenock now. When one looks at Greenock's finances, one sees that we tried to avoid a large part of these rises in previous years. It is not always easy to cushion the ratepayer against inevitable rises by reason of circumstances which are outwith our control, although the Government certainly influence this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the information given to me when I answered Questions in the House about this matter is perfectly valid. The Department's belief at that time was that on past trends—that is, on the conditions and circumstances for which hon. Members opposite were responsible—the rate bill would rise by 6 per cent., but that by deducting the increase—say, about 2 per cent.—in new property, the net estimate was 4 per cent. It remains to be seen whether that estimate is proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It comes ill from an official Opposition spokesman to criticise us for not having done in seven months what his party failed to do in 13 years. It is also a bit much, although I can hardly hold the hon. Member responsible personally, to have to face an Opposition who in their time, particularly from the middle nineteen-fifties, singularly lacked purpose in local government finance and who, when they did act, acted against the interests of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
When the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) was in my position and was answering a similar debate in 1962 he tried to defend the attack on what had happened with the Public Works Loan Board. In 1955 under the hon. Member's Government, £44 million was borrowed by local authorities through the Public Works Loan Board. The former Government then made the edict that the Board must be a lender of last resort and by 1961–62, the year which the hon. Member defended, the figure had dropped substantially to a mere £5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only last year that we saw a change in the position effectively because of what the party opposite had done in 1963, when the amount which local authorities were allowed to borrow went up by 20 per cent. of their long-term borrowing or to £100,000, whichever was the greater. The present Government early and immediately raised that amount to 30 per cent. effectively before the Budget and declared in the Budget that they would try to find a figure of up to 50 per cent. for areas of economic difficulty and distress. This is still being considered by my right hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point against the hon. Member for Cathcart, however, is not all these and other points to which I can come presently. The important point, and it is a charge which his party cannot escape, is that during the nineteen-fifties the bill to ratepayers was allowed to rise faster than almost any other factor in the economy. That is the simple fact. The Opposition can move about in arguments as long as they like concerning the proportion of tax which is raised on taxpayers, but they cannot escape this charge. It was the recognition of this obvious fact which drove the last Government to appoint the Allen Committee and drove them also to consider a re-examination of local and central Government finance, an examination which we are bringing to a head as quickly as we can. It began under the last Government, I believe, in 1963. A whole year passed when they did nothing in this regard. The only fruits which we have are the fruits of the Allen Committee, which we will readily pick and to which I will refer presently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Cathcart on his first appearance on the Front Bench on the Opposition side. I hope that he remains there for a long time. I also congratulate him on surviving the struggle against the Eton ties. I hope that he does not find the greasy pole as difficult to manipulate as did his former colleague who represented Liverpool, Toxteth, whose illuminating memoirs I commend to the Committee. The hon. Member has a hard struggle ahead of him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I present the Government's case for what we are doing, I want to sketch a little of the background to supplement the undoubted fair representation which we have had from the hon. Member for Cathcart. Between 1951–52 and 1963–64, the total expenditure of local authorities, leaving aside trading undertakings such as the public transport system in the four cities, increased from £102 million to £270 million. It is true that grants more or less kept pace with that increase in expenditure, but the net result to the ratepayer was that the sum demanded by way of rates rose from £37 million to £104 million. In the financial year 1964–65 just ended, the figure is estimated to be £111 million. That is the measure of what the Opposition did when they were in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we analyse the 1964–65 figures, it will be seen that the gross expenditure on rate fund services, excluding trading undertakings and the common good, was £302 million. Receipts, mainly rents, amounted to £51 million and grants to £140 million, leaving rates to bear the figure of £111 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the hon. Member's hon. Friends that if they try to argue that we can solve the problem of local finance simply by raising the amount of receipts, mainly rents, they are up a greasy pole, because that is financial nonsense. It may be an element in the argument, but it is by no means decisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures reflect another great failure of the last Government. That is, that between 1951 and 1964 the value of the £ fell from 20s. to 14s. 6d. In all their calculations of grants and extra grants, hon. Members opposite must always assess the real value of what these represent in terms of that figure, which is now
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
in the political record and cannot be expunged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are a few hon. Members who would argue the case that we should cut down local government services. I readily concede that there is a case for making sure that investment in the public services is properly assessed and that the efficiency and economy which we hope for in central administration will be practised there also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart was kind enough to quote part of what I intended to say this morning—namely, the Labour Party manifesto, which declares clearly what is our intention. My hon. Friends in their remarks will, I am sure, be tempted to be a little impatient with the hon. Member. I hope that my hon. Friends will not be impatient with him, because his speech is a wonderful compliment to us. To argue that we have not done all in seven months what we said we would do is a tremendous compliment to us and it must be taken that way. We must not be angry with the hon. Member for saying what he did. His quicksilver speech will be useful for Tory propagandists for the next 12 months, but by this time next year it will be in the limbo of forgetfulness, because all his predictions will no longer stand in view of the local government Bill which we intend to introduce in the next Session of Parliament. When these vital decisions are taken and the fundamental review is seen to be assessed by Ministers and published by them, all this snow will quickly vanish before the sun of enlightenment which the Government will bring forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman has said about the new Bill on local government is very interesting. Will he give us a preview of what is in that Bill?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pity that the Chair has barred me from answering the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be premature to disclose all that Ministers are thinking about and
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
what they are deciding in this field. I will, however, because I am always a very fair-minded person, touch on a number of matters. Naturally the Government will be much influenced by what hon. Members opposite say, and more influenced by what my hon. Friends say. There are a number of matters concerning this problem which I should like to raise. However, let me finish what I have to say about the past record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Opposition's period of office, the Exchequer's share of net grant and rate-borne local expenditure rose, but marginally, from 54½ to 56 per cent. This is a situation which is clearly not acceptable to this Government, especially when the level of expenditure is rising so fast. Priority must be given to the improvement of those aspects of the rating system which cause most hardship. The poorer ratepayers, in particular, must be helped. A number of Scottish local authorities, my own among them, have commendably used existing powers to remit rates on the ground of poverty or inability to pay and are operating rate rebate schemes, which do something to remove the worst hardship. In the Government's opinion, the powers left to us by hon. Members opposite are too narrow and, however humanely the schemes are operated by good local authorities, such as mine, they are not broad enough to prevent all the hardship and to make the rating system recognisably equitable. Legislation is required, and we shall consider to what extent the Exchequer should contribute towards the cost of rate rebate schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said in our Election manifesto, a major reform of the rating system and investigation of alternative forms of local government finance is a detailed and lengthy process, since we are determined to find a lasting answer. The hon. Member for Cathcart referred to "immediate and early" relief to ratepayers. The words are "early relief" to ratepayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "immediate" was used in connection with inducements for housebuilding by local authorities. In that connection, could the hon. Gentleman explain why some of his hon. Friends talk about building workers being paid off? The quotation which I gave is on page 18 of 	<i>Signposts for Scotland,</i> which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While our long-term plans are being worked out local authorities will be given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
immediate inducements both to step up their housing programmes and to make much greater use of their powers."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very careful to note that the hon. Member used the words "immediate and early"—it was his first exercise, and therefore I excuse him, but I must defend this position—in strict relation to his first quotation and in the second instance in relation to what he quoted from 	<i>Signposts for Scotland.</i> I am willing to defend that proposition later, but in relation to the proposition about early relief I invite the Committee to think about what was the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We came to power on 16th October. Some of us became Ministers a few days after that. It took some time, naturally, to go over all that the past Administration had left us, but it was less than a month later that Ministers met local authorities to discuss the general grant figures. It was then that the Cabinet had to make up its mind about what it should do in relation, not only to Scotland but to England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart was quite wrong in what he said about the general grant for 1966–67. If he consults the Scottish Development Department's Report, he will see an explanation of the position. The fact is that £1·2 million extra which would not have been in the grant had the Conservative Party been in power was included in the grant for unspecified purposes, or, rather, for more general purposes, such as development. It will be seen that there is no comparable record of that happening. It is a bit much that we should have criticism from the Opposition when we remember that in the General Grant Order of 1965–66—that is, the first year, not the second year—we had to find the £1 million which hon. Members opposite promised in 1963. They only promised it; they never produced the money. We produced the money in this critical year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessors are carrying through the process of the revaluation of property for completion in 1966, when the new valuation notices will be issued. Hon. Members will know that the Annual Report of the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council for last year records that the assessors have reported good
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
progress with the work for revaluation and expect to be able to complete it in time, in spite of the shortage of experienced and qualified staff. We are grateful to the assessors for this work. The Government have no clear idea of what the figures will show. Therefore, we are not in a position to offer advice at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the importance of the new valuations and the decisions of policy, the assessors have been asked to give estimates of the total valuations of the different classes of property—industrial, commercial, domestic and miscellaneous—in their areas. These are now coming in and we are studying them. The principal question is whether to continue the derating of industry in Scotland. There are conflicting views about this, even among hon. Members opposite. There is a feeling there that perhaps industry should be completely derated. There is a feeling among back bench Members on this side of the Committee that we should consider rerating industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is a vital decision for Ministers to take because we must balance, not only the welfare of local government finance, but, much more important, the upsurge of new industry. This is a critical time in Scotland's history and we must get over it if we are to be able to support a good local government service. When the Secretary of State gets the report of the revaluation we shall look at the figures and make a decision as soon as possible. It is fair to say, however, that without derating the rates on a factory in Scotland would be well over 50 per cent. more than on a similar factory in England or Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart, among others, made representations to me on behalf of his hard-pressed constituents that the 1966 revaluation be postponed till the new plans for local government finance have been announced. I have written to the hon. Gentleman on one or two occasions about this. We intend to announce our plans well before revaluation takes effect, the object of which is simply to bring up to date the relative values of properties in each area. It does not in itself increase the total rate bill.

It is worth while pointing out that in 1961—and no doubt it is as a result of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that bitter experience that representations are being made to the hon. Member and others to ask the Government to suspend revaluation—householders' share of the total rate bill went down from 59 to 53 per cent., although this was concealed by the fact that there was an altogether exceptional increase of 19 per cent. in the total rate bill that year. People identified the heavy increase of local government expenditure that year with revaluation. They were wrong. The blame for that increase must lie squarely on the Opposition. I hope that this increase will not be repeated in 1966. We shall do everything we can to ensure that it is not repeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth emphasising that bringing valuations up to date does not increase ratepayers' ability to pay, and local authority budgets should, as in any other year, be prepared with the need for economy in mind so far as is consistent with the proper development of services. I offer that as an admonition, but a friendly admonition, to local government treasurers who have a very complicated task to perform, which I concede. Nevertheless, that is a point which they should bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Report of the Allen Committee on household rates. The previous Government set up this Committee in 1963 but denied it the power to make recommendations about rates. Its Report puts into precise terms what we all know about rates—that they bear far too heavily on the poorer sections of the community, that they make no provision for hardship and that they are collected in a way designed to make the burden of rates appear larger than it really is. Nevertheless, it is a useful, comprehensive Report. But what a pity it is that the Committee was not allowed to make recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether any official Opposion spokesman can say why the Allen Committee was not allowed to make recommendations. The Government would have welcomed the chance of considering recommendations from an expert Committee like this. We may not have accepted or liked them, but at least we should have been willing to consider them. The Opposition wanted to pull out the sting before the bee struck. The Report shows that the average Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
household pays 4 per cent. of income in rates. However, as the Report shows, households with under £6 a week pay nearly 10 per cent. of their income in rates, and households with between £6 and £10 a week nearly 8 per cent. At the rich end of the scale, those with over £1,500 a year pay only 2·6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The method of collecting rates by means of lump sums was heavily criticised by the Allen Committee, and the Scottish position is somewhat worse than that in England and Wales, where rate collections are usually 6 monthly, with two demands a year. But in Scotland there is still, unfortunately, only one demand a year. A single rate demand is a very easy and convenient way of collection for local authorities, but we must ask whether it can any longer be accepted now that the rate bill is so large. Some local authorities have, very commendably, gone ahead and introduced instalment payment systems, and we shall have to consider with local authorities as a whole how far this should be extended, or, in fact, made obligatory. In the meantime, local authorities would do well to consider introducing their own instalment systems, and to give them adequate publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the grants system, which we criticised very heavily when in opposition, and we do not retract a single word of our criticism. Ever since the general grant was introduced by the Conservative Party, it has been the principal means of distributing Exchequer money to local authorities. In 1964–65, just ended, out of a total of £140 million Exchequer grant to local authorities, £74 million was given by way of general grant as against £40 million for specific grants and £26 million for Exchequer equalisation grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government have always made clear their objection to the general grant system, which lumps together expenditure on a number of services and distributes grants to individual local authorities according to general factors which do not necessarily have anything to do with the special requirements of each service. This is called trusting the local authorities. As a result, local authorities with exceptionally heavy programmes of development have felt themselves very unfairly treated. After the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
general grant formula was introduced, the previous Government considered a change in the distribution formula, but, in their dying years of office, decided against doing anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to provide a continuing supply of Exchequer money to local authorities, the Government, when they took office, were faced with the necessity of continuing the general grant system for the time being. I have explained how in the first few dramatic weeks of this Government's period of office the Ministers responsible for local government services had to make a vital decision and get the concurrence of local Government in this decision. This was at a time when we were entering the fourth quarter of the most disastrous year in our history as a trading nation, when the deficit on our balance of payments soared to well over £700 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members reflect on yesterday's figures showing a comparison of last year with this year, they will realise what an immense difficulty the Government have had in the last eight months in trying to pull this country together and to get it moving forward once again. It will be a long time before the people forget the state in which hon. Members opposite left this country last year. This always reflects itself in what Ministers do, particularly those in spending Departments. Hon. Members opposite will very much regret the extravagant things that they are saying now just because we are not carrying out a five-year programme within one Parliamentary session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many debates on the alternatives to rates. One of the most important things, perhaps, which a radical Socialist Administration can do is to make a fundamental change in the rating system, if possible. We have considered every suggestion, irrespective of its origins. We are perfectly willing to listen to any fresh suggestions put to us today. If they commend themselves to us, the Government, with their immense bilateral relationship between Scotland and England, will convey them to our English colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment on two. One suggestion—and I did not like this—is the idea of a poll tax on wage earners who are not ratepayers. The idea would be to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
young people and others who are not householders in their own right contribute directly towards the cost of local services. It is clear that a family with two or three wage earners in it is in a much better position to pay rates than is a family with one wage earner only, and a good deal of resentment against the rating system is caused by this anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems very doubtful whether a poll tax would be a proper remedy. If it were levied at the same rate on all wage earners who were not ratepayers—and this is the basic principle of a poll tax—it would be unfair to small wage earners and almost as regressive as rates themselves. It would, moreover, be extremely difficult to enforce payment; no tax can be effectively collected simply by making it an offence not to pay it; if substantial sums are involved, and without some form of personal registration and inspection, which would be abhorrent, a poll tax would be widely evaded. If it were deducted from earnings by the employer, like Income Tax, it would cease to be a poll tax and become a local income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local income tax has often been favoured by many hon. Members on this side of the Committee, and I was in favour of it myself, before taking up Ministerial office, and began to appreciate all the arguments against the imposition of changes of this kind. As a principle it is eminently sensible. Our Scandinavian friends operate it very successfully and without any of the irritations which we have among our ratepayers on the subject of local government expenditure. But the essential thing about Scandinavia is that it has a different system of collecting taxes. If we had a similar system of State income tax to that which operates in the Scandinavian countries it would be a relatively simple matter for the Government quite quickly to introduce a local income tax. But to do this in the next Session of Parliament would be an enormous task. That is not to say that the Government are against the idea of a local income tax. It is the practical application of it which is difficult. Something must be done soon. The Opposition have wasted too much time in Government. It may prove to be the case that we cannot apply a local income tax because of the pressure of time and the nature of the operation itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
A local income tax is the only tax which could bring in enough money to replace rates entirely. To do this at present it would have to be fixed at about 2s. 6d. in the pound, with a corresponding tax, analogous to Corporation Tax, on companies. Such a tax has many attractions. Above al, it would be a fair and progressive tax, levied at the lowest rate on people with the lowest incomes and at the highest rate on those with the highest incomes. Nobody would escape it, except those below an exemption limit fixed in the light of social considerations. It would be buoyant, automatically bringing in more revenue as incomes increased, without the rate having to be increased—a substantial advantage over the present local rates, where the poundage has to be increased yearly in order to bring in more money, except in years when revaluation has increased the total amount of rateable values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibilities of establishing a local income tax are therefore being considered very carefully. No final decision has been reached, but colossal difficulties would arise in connection with it. The collection of a local income tax could not readily be grafted on to the system for collection of the national income tax without a vast increase in the amount of clerical work required, both by the income tax authorities and by employers who deduct tax from wages and salaries at source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local tax means anything it must be open to local authorities to decide its rate themselves and, in consequence, a local income tax would have to be deducted from employees' earnings at different rates according to where they lived. This would place a tremendous burden on employers. Even if this were accepted, it would be impossible to devise a scheme of local income tax which was applicable to dividends, since tax on dividends is deducted at source, and neither the income tax authorities nor anyone else is in a position to say what is the dividend income of all persons living in a particular local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the basic difficulty about a local income tax in Britain. We are envious of the Scandinavian countries for being in such a position as they are at present. There are many practical difficulties.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Even if a local income tax system could be devised the revenue would vary substantially between one area and another, the authorities in the more prosperous areas naturally doing best. Some form of equalisation system would have to be devised, and this would present even greater problems than the equalisation grants system based upon differences in rateable values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite my apparent pessimism, however, Ministers are still looking at this method urgently in order to see if it is at all possible to consider a local Income Tax as an alternative to rating. If it is not, the Government's intention is to take a number of important and fundamental steps in the direction which I have already suggested, and which I hope will become apparent as the months go by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee is now convinced that the Government's idea of reform is not piecemeal, as it was in 1955, when the decisions taken culminating in the 1958 Act of Parliament led to the present system. It is not going to be patchy, as it has been in the past 13 years. It is to be a fundamental change—as fundamental as we can achieve. We must find money for the development of local authority services, and it must be found on the fairest basis possible, especially having regard to the enormous sums of money involved and the even larger sums which will be involved in future. Equitable distribution is the core of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are striving for a fair deal between central Government and local government—a fair deal for each local authority, and a fair deal between the better-off citizens and those on lower incomes. The Government's objective is threefold: to spread the rate burden more fairly; to give help where it is most needed, and to strengthen Scottish local authorities to do their important job fully and well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) hopes to catch your eye later, Mr. McInnes, to speak on the question of local authority finance and rates. I want to turn to another question which is of concern to the Liberal Party. I do so under the Estimates for Class III, Vote 2 and Class VI, Vote 8—dealing with payments to the Post Office for services in connection with Parliamentary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
elections and the registration of electors, respectively. Those are two of the estimates which we are asked to consider to ensure that there is a smooth conduct of Parliamentary elections and that those elections are conducted in such a way as to be an accurate reflection of the wishes of the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Committee last met a year ago to discuss Scottish Estimates the composition of the parties in Scotland has changed, with an intervening General Election. I note that £75,000 was spent in payments to the Post Office—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Member to confine himself exclusively to the Votes and the Estimates before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am doing so, under Class III, Vote 2, on page 12 of the Civil Estimates, and also on Class VI, Vote 8—which deal with the two items that I have already mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last election resulted in Scotland's being represented by 43 Labour Members, 23 Conservative Members and five Liberal Members. The Liberal Party now represents one in 15 of Scottish Members. This being so, it must be the concern of all members of the Committee to ensure that the wishes of the electorate should be seen to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were therefore most concerned when, last Tuesday, a Resolution was passed in the House to set up a second Scottish Standing Committee. My hon. Friends and I then wished to raise the question of our representation on that Committee but did not do so because, if we had, the Resolution could not have been passed, and the legislation would have been delayed. We were therefore very concerned when we saw the published list of members of Standing Committee A and found that it consisted of 25 Scottish Members, 13 of whom were Labour and 12 Conservative. There was no Liberal Member on the Committee of 25 Members. Now that the Scottish representation in this House contains one Liberal out of every 15 Scottish Members it is clear that there should be at least one Liberal Member on that Committee. I raise this point now because although the three Bills to be discussed by that Committee are fairly non-controversial it sets a precedent which
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
has not occurred before in this Session, in that there has not been a Standing Committee of fewer than 35 Members, which has meant that the Liberal Party has hitherto had adequate representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be the concern of all Scottish Members, regardless of party, to see that the wishes of the electorate are carried out and that both Front Benches should make sure that before the Standing Committee meets tomorrow this injustice is put right and that there is Liberal representation on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The issue which the hon. Member is raising is not a matter for this Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to point out that if we are being asked to vote public money to ensure that the wishes of the electorate are seen to be carried out—and it is our responsibility to do this within the workings of the House—this Committee must be concerned at the fact that Standing Committee A, which is composed of Members taken exclusively from this Committee, is not representative of the composition of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is surely a fair point to make. I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer on the point, except to say that I hope that it is within the power of the Government to make sure that the attention of the Committee of Selection is drawn to this grievance. We allowed the Resolution to go through last Tuesday. We co-operated to some degree on this matter, and the Resolution was passed without opposition. We have now seen that co-operation in this respect has not paid any dividends.

Members have listened to what I have said and that the composition of Standing Committee A will be altered in order to meet the wishes of the electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) for giving us a preview of the Tory manifesto for the next Election. It was very interesting, and will be used extensively by hon. Members when the time comes. I was surprised at the hon. Member's concern for the ratepayers. When his party formed the Government it did not show this concern. Why did it abolish owners' rates? Its purpose was clearly done bearing in mind the increases in expenditure which would come along, and to ensure that those should be borne exclusively by the occupiers. The Government had no concern for the ratepayers at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then they introduced the general grant. Why did they do that? It was because they knew perfectly well that expenditure on all the departments on which they previously had percentage grants would go up. They were aware that, if it were done on a percentage grant basis, the Tory Government's expenditure would have to go up in proportion. So they decided to put it on a general grant basis so that they could escape, if they so desired, their share of the expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At many meetings in St. Andrew's House, where local authorities have been represented, there have been arguments about the Government's percentage of expenditure and the fact that it was decreasing rather than increasing. This all goes to show that the Tory Government's concern for the ratepayers did not
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
bear any relationship to the views expressed by hon. Gentlemen opposite about their concern for the ratepayers. When in Government they had little or no concern for them, other than to make them pay an increasing share of the burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman not hear his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary say that the percentage of expenditure borne in the last few years had increased marginally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood my hon. Friend to say "in the last year".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, at those meetings which I used to attend and which must have been attended by hon. Gentlemen opposite—and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) has great knowledge of these matters—there were frequent arguments not merely between local treasurers but between chamberlains and paid officials about the percentage over the years becoming smaller. The Government percentage certainly became smaller, although by small amounts. There was indeed no concern by the last Government for the ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart went on to speak about restraining spendthrift local authorities. Is this not a new departure for the party opposite, after all it said about local authorities managing their own affairs? With exactly whom or what does the hon. Gentleman want to interfere? Does he want to restrain the City of Edinburgh from spending considerable sums on the Festival? He did not mention that. Or does he want to restrain Dundee or Glasgow from subsidising corporation tenants? That would appear to be more in line, from his comments, with his thinking. Does the party opposite consider it more important to have things like the Edinburgh Festival subsidised by the ratepayers or that the ratepayers should help to ensure that people have decent homes in which to live? I would give priority to the latter, although I doubt whether hon. Gentlemen opposite would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings us to the whole question of housing subsidies. What does it all boil down to? When the Housing Acts were passed a number of years ago there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
was written into the legislation provisions to cover subsidies being paid by both the Government and local authorities. The Government subsidy was invariably two to one or three to one compared with the local authority subsidy. Now consider the position, including the 	<i>Review</i> from which the hon. Gentleman quoted. The local authority subsidy is now at least equal to the Government subsidy. Thus, the Government are paying a smaller share and the ratepayers a larger share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman might say that local authorities are fixing rents too low, but is that so? If we examine the old argument about charging economic rents we find that local authorities, for example in my constituency, are having to base their rent policies on several factors. In my constituency some houses were built many years ago for about £400 each. The economic rent for such a house is about 8s. 6d. a week. The local authority more recently has built multistorey blocks, with each dwelling costing £4,000. The economic rent for such a dwelling is more than £4 a week. All this is without rates. Would it be fair to charge both sets of tenants the economic rents in those cases, remembering that the city assessor has said that the house which cost £400 is in many respects better than the dwelling which cost £4,000? To try to fix economic rents in terms of building costs and nothing else would be nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, again, leads to further questions of subsidies. If I, as a corporation tenant, receive a subsidy of about £37 a year everybody kicks up a tremendous row, it is in the newspapers, people ask why I am being subsidised and all sorts of questions are asked. However, if I become an owner occupier and receive a subsidy of about £100 a year nobody complains. I urge hon. Gentlemen opposite to get the idea out of their heads that only corporation tenants get subsidies. Whether one calls it a tax relief or a subsidy, it is a subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart went on to tell us how the Tory Government had reduced taxation over the years. I urge him to ask a Parliamentary Question to find out the total amount of Government expenditure when
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
they took office and when they left office. He will find that expenditure during those years increased by more than £1,000 million. From where did the money come? Obviously the Government did not conjure it up out of thin air. Of course, it came from the taxpayers—so do not let hon. Gentlemen opposite try to kid the public that their Government took less money from taxpayers than is now being taken from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary about the possibility of a local income tax. I agree that it would be a better system than the present rating one, if it could be made to work, and I realise the difficulties mentioned by my hon. Friend. However, he did not mention one difficulty, that the public themselves, particularly ordinary working people who grudge paying Income Tax—although I agree that it is the fairest form of tax for them to pay—grudge paying tax because they cannot see anything tangible for their money.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this chance to say a few words on local government expenditure because it is so important in Scotland. One must be constructive about it. My hon. Friends and I do not think very much of the policies of the party opposite, and similarly, hon. Gentlemen opposite do not think much of our policies, particularly in recent years. However, that sort of approach will not get us anywhere in the coming decade, and nothing that has been said so far today will make county and burgh treasurers—indeed, the ratepayers—sleep any more happily tonight than they did last night. We must, therefore, consider ways of solving the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary gave us some interesting facts, particularly regarding the possible alternative of a local income tax. At one time I considered the possibility of a local P.A.Y.E. system. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
thought that it might be feasible but, having heard the Under-Secretary's explanation, I appreciate the difficulties involved. We are, therefore, back to the collection of rates, more or less under the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that he mentioned the instalment system, because my constituency has had an instalment system for some years now, and has found it works very satisfactorily. The county treasurer has had very few arrears to chase up at the end of the year and I commend the system to all local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years we have been supplied with a great many statistics. Indeed, the country is knee deep in them. We have had reports from accountants and treasurers in Scotland, Scottish Development Department Reports, the 	<i>Rating Review</i> by the Scottish branch of the Institute of Municipal Treasurers and Accountants and many more. What we do not know about rates in Scotland is not worth knowing. What we want to know is how to deal with the situation. As I have said before when we have debated in this Committee on other subjects, the whole problem of local government is not one of administration but one of finance. However much we may think and dream about regionalisation, which might to some degree help, it will not improve the financial situation of local authorities because the same number of services must still be paid for by the same number of ratepayers. We must, therefore, first look at the two major problems of interest rates and the disproportionate cost of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem, interest rates, we understand. Money for investment often comes from abroad, particularly from Europe and from America—and if we have an unsettled economic situation in the world we are bound to have difficulty in keeping interest rates down. It is the long-term interest rates which are more important than the problems of short-term borrowing. Our first task must be to keep interest rates down if we are to achieve the development in Scotland we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disproportionate cost of education is, for local government, the crux of the financial problem. The increasing cost of education has to be met by the same number of people, as I said before. It is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
argument to say that rateable values have increased if the number of rateable subjects remains the same. It is difficult to make comparisons beyond the start of the general grant since expenditure is now shared by rating authorities on a gross basis. Prior to the general grant Government grants were direct and deducted prior to the sharing taking place. I appreciate that this is a complicated matter. Indeed, even local government finance committees have the greatest difficulty understanding the workings of the general grant and equalisation grant systems and—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that 17 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room, and 17 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To bring home this disproportionate situation regarding local education costs I would use my own constituency because it has an education authority within a constituency. The whole constituency has one education authority. In 1959–60 the total expenditure in Dumfriesshire was £1,527,000 and of that no less than £1,232,000 was on education costs. In this coming year 1965–66 the total costs are estimated at £2,493,000 and of that education is going to take £2,047,000. One sees that a large proportion of the costs of a local authority are on education, and in case anyone thinks these are exceptional increases in education, they have been of the order of 8 per cent. over the last six years, which is in line with all other local authorities in Scotland. In these six years there has been an increase in total expenditure of £960,000 of which the education increase is £815,000 and the percentage increase in education is rising every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not against expenditure in education. On the contrary, I am for it, but we must look at this problem very seriously. It is true the policy of general grants and the Exchequer equalisation grant have increased, but we cannot escape the fact that the same number of ratepayers are having to pay this rising share of the expenditure and in this case the actual cost to the ratepayers over the period is £230,000 or 3s. 4d. on the rates.

high figure and it is rising. For this to be equitable for a static number of ratepayers the burden of personal incomes would have to rise at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is unlikely to happen in a rural constituency but it could possibly happen in an industrial constituency where there may be a substantial increase in wages. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) said, education costs have been rising, and the point I would put to the Under-Secretary about further education and technical college costs is that although this eventually comes out of the national total of pooled expenditure for further education, it may be that for the first year or two the local authority has to pay the costs till it balances out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond the straight costs to the ratepayer what is the other detrimental effect of the high cost of education and the tight budget of other committees of local authorities? It has a most depressing effect on the committee of a local authority if it has virtually no money to spend other than on existing services. What a committee likes to do is to get its teeth into new subjects such as new houses and constructive planning of recreation and playing fields and so on. If there is no money other than that to keep existing services going, this depresses the committee and that percolates through to the county, and able people do not come forward to join local authorities, if they feel they are going just to have to sit there and keep expenditure down every year. If we are going to have enthusiastic local authority committees they must have a measure of money, over and above that necessary for existing services, to put into new developments. I urge that this should be conceded, because it is the enthusiastic committee which sets the tone for the region it represents.

I particularly wanted to touch the problem of roads because it is so important in rural constituencies. I am certain that transportation is going to be the life blood of Scotland. We have the 100 per cent. grant on the trunk roads, but I do wish that the Scottish Development Department would view with a little more favour the upgrading of roads from Class 2 to Class 1 and Class 3 to Class 2
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
and from unclassified to Class 3. By increasing the grant it could help local authorities, particularly rural authorities, to improve their road standards. A great deal more money needs to be spent on roads, on such things as alignments and surfacing. I would urge the Under-Secretary to keep up all the pressure he can on the Minister of Transport regarding the A.6 in England. Under the previous Government we in Scotland have made tremendous strides with the A.74 from Glasgow but from Kendal to Carlisle—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am urging the Under-Secretary to do is to make every effort in pressing the Minister of Transport on this subject, because it is so vital to Scotland.

We have heard today of the serious effect on finance of local authorities. What we want to hear in the winding up speeches is what the Government are going to do in the future under their review. The review may not yet be complete but if some idea could be given about it, it would be of the greatest advantage. We want to know what the solution is going to be. We know it is not easy but what the county treasurers and the ratepayers want to know is how we can slow down the continued rise in the increase in rates and at the same time continue to develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). I think he did remarkably well, considering the poor brief he had to speak to. We have just gone through a period of 13 years of Tory affluence during which time the Scottish local authorities have moved from one financial crisis to another. During that time the previous Administration sought to pass the burden from the Exchequer to the back of the Scottish ratepayers.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
We must forgive the hon. Member for Cathcart. He has not had the advantage of sitting on these benches listening to his right hon. and hon. Friends on these subjects, although I thought he might have read the speeches. An hon Gentleman who is not now with us told us last year that interest rates had no bearing on the Scottish local government. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) told us so often that this was not a question about which we should trouble ourselves. Of course it was nonsense. This is probably one of the most vital questions we have to face up to and I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will be able to find a solution to a problem which has been left by the previous Administration and which is not of our own making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Allen Committee has been mentioned and rightly so. It has always struck me that the thing about the Allen Committee was that it was set up to investigate the question of hardship on ratepayers, but it was not set up to investigate the hardship on Scottish ratepayers. It was the hardships and the protests arising for English ratepayers. We knew, and Allen merely confirmed what we knew, that the Scottish ratepayer was paying far more and having to meet an increasingly heavy burden. Allen made a bare statement that the average rate on the householder in Scotland is about £7 a year greater than the average rate on the English householder. If it is considered in that way it might not seem such a terrible problem, but as we are dealing with rateable values, and as this is linked with the kind of house one stays in, then it becomes important to examine this aspect of the matter and see what the truth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The English house is almost five apartments; the Scottish house is just over three apartments; but the Scot has to pay £7 a year more for his three apartments than the Englishman pays for his five apartments. One has to measure these things using the phrase of the hon. Member for Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), "comparing like with like". I remember his telling us this so often. The Scottish householder, living in his little dog kennel of a house, compared with the Englishman's, is paying more in rates than the Englishman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Furthermore, he has to pay it out of considerably less money in his pocket. The statistics of the Scottish Office have had to be revised time after time. We were told that the difference between Scottish earnings and earnings in England was a mere 5 per cent. We finally got that up to 17 per cent. after some persistence, but even then it is doubtful if that is the correct figure. So the Scot has a smaller house and less money in his pocket and has to pay a higher rate. Disappointingly, Allen has nothing very much to say about why this should be so. It may be that the remit was such that the Committee was not able to say so, but I took a poor view of Allen. It seemed it was not terribly concerned with the Scottish position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Scotsman pay more? There is, first, derating, and therefore the Scottish householder has to subsidise Scottish industry. I do not mind a subsidy to Scottish industry, but why should it be the Scottish householder who pays the subsidy, and not the householders who can afford to do so, but the rich and the poor alike? We obviously have to have rerating here, and if there is to be a subsidy for Scottish industry then it should fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the taxpayer spread out over the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amused to read in committee reports that we are nationalistic. The most nationalistic Members in this Parliament are English Members in the Committee when it comes to spending money in Scotland. How they resent the idea that it might be English money that goes to subsidise something in Scotland! As long as we have one economy, and till we separate the economies, this has to be a charge on the Exchequer and rerating will have some effect in redressing the balance. It may not solve the whole problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect is the question of housing. One has to agree this is a terrible problem. We have to build so many more houses than have to be built in England by local authorities. In Scotland the local authorities have built over 50 per cent. of the complete housing stock. In England the figure is about 20 per cent. Obviously a much greater burden falls on Scotland, and although the housing subsidy in Scotland is larger
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
than that in England the difference in the subsidy does not even meet the difference in construction. Every one knows that it costs 20 per cent. more to build the same house in Scotland than it does to build it in England. Therefore, the increased subsidy does not even meet that extra cost, let alone the extra burden because of the greater number of houses required to be built by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was the record of the previous Administration? They boosted the subsidy in 1953. They did very well, for one year—or was it two years? Then, immediately they lowered the subsidy to a figure which, proportionately to the cost of housing, was the lowest of all time. A great burden was thrown on Scottish local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart is fond of talking about economic rents. What would be the economic rent of a Glasgow high flat today? Would £150 or £200 cover it? I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member must be aware that the average economic rent allowing for Government subsidy for a Glasgow Corporation house would be just over £1 a week for the average house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the answer I wanted. It means that people who remain in pre-war houses are providing the subsidy for those who live in the houses which are built today. That was the very point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), that people who live in out-of-date houses which are hardly worth the money have to pay extra rent to subsidise today's house building. That was the purpose of the party opposite. It dissociated the idea of a housing subsidy from a house which was being built and was determined to pass the whole cost on to the tenants of the local authority houses. That was what hon. Members opposite were saying over the last three years with their exhortations for increases in rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got to get back to sanity in regard to house building. The subsidy, both from the central Government and from the local authority, has to be related to the cost of building a house. We can-
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
not for ever pass on the cost of house building in Scotland, because there are not the resources among the tenants to meet that cost. It is time that we faced this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart mentioned also education. But who created the difficulty in education? In Glasgow, the major problem is the cost of education, not housing. How did this happen? Was it not a previous Tory Administration who wiped out the education grant and introduced the block or general grant system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Member agree that giving control to local authority members is desirable and that, therefore, the object of the exercise was genuine and desirable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member still lives in a world of illusion if he thinks that that is the case and that any more control passes to a local authority by reason of the alteration of the grant system. Coming, as the hon. Member does, from Dumfries, particularly with a local authority which has a rebate system—an admirable system—where 85 per cent. of the tenants get a rebate valued on an average at £26 a year, he would, I should have imagined, thought less of it. It does not mean a thing in control either in housing, education or any other service. All that it meant was that the local ratepayers had to bear a great burden or, as was more likely, that the service would be cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens today in a local authority? First, the local authority decides what work it must carry out. One task is to build houses and another is to meet the burden of education. A third, perhaps, is roads. Then, the local authority will see what it can cut. Parks, open spaces and all the amenities are cut, including the social services. That is why, even if an increase in rent is imposed, as happens with many Scottish local authorities, it does not mean a reduction in rates. It means only that some of the services which have been so long neglected at last begin to get a little money and local authorities begin to act like local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish local authority services are in a bad way. Hon. Members do not need to investigate the statistics. To convince
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
themselves, all that they have to do is to walk through an English local authority area, see what is being done there, and then go back to Scotland and have a look. The evidence of their eyes will convince them that we are in a bad way. We are not doing the tasks that should be done because the Scottish ratepayer is not able to bear these burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thought that, following the Sorn Committee, sanity would come into the sysem. The Sorn Committee made the recommendations which were required to solve the problem. As a result, we had the 1957 and the 1961 Acts, which altered the rating system and brought about revaluation. At last, we thought that finally the vital step would be taken and that the system of calculating grants would be done on a par with the English system. The previous Administration, however, ran away from it. Time and time again, they were tackled on this problem but they ran away from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vital question is the amount of general grant and the amount of equalisation grant which come to Scotland and the method by which they are calculated. In England, there is a formula which generates its own total. Before we know what a Scottish local authority will get, we have to make the English local authority calculation. Then, by a Goshen formula, with certain modifications, we decide how much poor Scotland is to get. We are, and have been, treated like poor relations. Right hon. and hon. Members opposite knew this, but they ran away from it. They made excuse after excuse and never faced the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand why, perhaps, even some of my right hon. Friends will not face the problem, because if Scotland were put on the same basis as England and Wales the equalisation grant, instead of being £26 million, as is suggested, would need to be £116 million. To put Scottish local authorities on the same basis as north of England local authorities would need £116 million. This basic need is the reason why it costs more to live in a Scottish house than in an English house, because rating nowadays has become a housing tax. It is not related to anything other than the house in which one lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
The difference, therefore, is between the presently paid £26 million and £116 million. There will be no equity or justice till Scotland gets that amount of money by equalisation grant. We can argue and give all the reasons under the sun, but that one central fact sticks out like a pikestaff. This is the reason why Scottish rates are so much higher than rates south of the Border. The explanation is the equalisation grant and also, in a lesser way, the general grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, till we grasp that nettle, hon. Members opposite are straining at gnats when they talk about petrol tax and such other things. This is the main question and this is the question which must be settled. It should have been settled some time ago following the 1961 revaluation. The Second Report of the Working Party on the equalisation grant clearly made the point way back in 1957 or 1958. It was known to the previous Administration, but they would not face it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with my hon. and right hon. Friends who are having to clear up the mess having come fresh to the job after a period of neglect and disinterest and a period during which the previous Administration ran away from problem after problem. My right hon. and hon. Friends have my sympathy, but I hope at least that this Administration will fairly and squarely face the real problem of Scottish rating, which is the way in which Scotland is treated in regard to Government grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, first of all, to echo the words of the hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on his first speech from the Front Bench. It was a splendid speech, if for no other reason than that it drew a certain amount of fire from hon. Members opposite. In so doing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it was a well-delivered speech and covered a wide field, but I did not know what Vote the hon. Member was dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that as my hon. Friend becomes more accustomed it will be patently obvious which Vote he is dealing with. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Hon. Members opposite may laugh, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
I think my hon. Friend's speech was a very good review of local government difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of rates obviously cannot be divorced from the whole machinery of local government. In turn, local government can function only on the delegated powers which it has from the central Government. In its report issued in October, 1964, the Saltire Society had this to say, that local government finance
	<br><blockquote><p>"cannot be ignored, and the Society think that the Working Party should come to terms with it now."</p></blockquote>
To my mind, that is germane to the question of rates which is before us today. When the Government are reviewing the whole position, I trust that they, too, will bear this in mind. Indeed, we are getting to the position where the present rating system is just about at its limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How far can we tax by rates the local population? There are two sides to this question: first the assessment; and then the amount raised in the form of rates. The present system has many anomalies, as we all know. I should like to look at just two of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take, for example, two owner-occupiers in two identical houses. One may be a thrifty man who saves his money and the second may spend his money on booze or Bingo. The first man, because of his thriftiness, can improve his house. The second man does not bother. Which man comes off best? Obviously, the second comes off best, because the first man, having improved his house, has his assessment increased and therefore has to pay more rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I turn to the size of the family. The hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary of State rejected the poll tax. I was not very convinced by his argument. I personally think that it is the best method, and I trust that the Government will not reject it out of hand when they are reviewing the position. I find it more than odd that in our present society a large family, receiving all the services, similar to the household next door with perhaps two adults only, pays exactly the same amount of rates, although they are living in identical properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Thirdly, I refer to the Allen Report which in paragraph 59, on page 22, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the lower the income, the higher the proportion that is taken in rates."</p></blockquote>
This is particularly true in one-adult and two-adult households where the rates are most regressive, and predominantly these households, throughout the United Kingdom, and more particularly in Scotland, consist of retired couples or single people. Take the extreme case of a two-adult household, the members of which are retired. The maximum income may be as little as £382. The percentage of their income which they pay on rates is 4 per cent. Going to the other end of the scale, take a two-adult, two-children household with a maximum income of £2,100. The amount of income spent on rates is only 2 per cent. So there is a vast and terrifying difference. This is one of the more searching revelations which the Allen Committee brought to light. Frankly, it is the one which struck me most forcefully when I read the Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the subject of grants. I personally consider, in my humble opinion, that the present method of general grant and equilisation grant is the best. It may be argued, and, indeed, it has been argued, that because of the great cost of education this system bears unfairly in certain places. Most assuredly it bears unfairly in my constituency. But, in spite of what the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) said, it gives a certain degree of freedom of action to local authorities. I have had a certain amount of experience of this in my own constituency, and I am sure that that is so. The more that we have direct payment for direct services, the more central control there must of necessity be. This is almost a truism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote the words of the Secretary of State during the debate in the House on 15th December when he said, in referring to the General Grant Order:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may well be—I hope that it will be the last time we shall have a General Grant (Increase) Order of this type, because the equity of apportionment is, to my mind, suspect as between the central authority and local authorities and, indeed, as between the services."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th December, 1964; Vol. 704, c. 278.]</p></blockquote>
Do the last words—"and, indeed, as between the services"—mean that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
are to return to a direct grant system under the Government's future plans? I think we should have a specific assurance about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the words "the equity of apportionment" when it comes to my own constituency. Right hon. and hon. Members on both sides know of the great difficulties which the County of Banff is sustaining because of the difficulty about the equity of apportionment. Therefore, I do not wish to take up time by going into the matter in detail. Various suggestions have been put forward at various times by the County Treasurer and the County Council of Banff to help ease the position. Notably, they suggested that burghs of under 2,000 population should be counted as rural population for weighting purposes. In Banffshire, because of an accident of history, we have no fewer than 11 small burghs ranging in population from 700 to 7,000. Because of this, and partially as a result of declining population, rates in Banffshire went up by no less than 173 per cent. compared with the all-Scotland increase of 127 per cent. in the three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anomaly of the formula for assessing Government grants is relevant to local expenditure. I should like to quote the amounts which it was calculated last year neighbouring counties to Banffshire received to show how this formula works inequitably in Banffshire because of the 11 small burghs not counting as rural population. In Kincardine 73 per cent. of total expenditure was met by grants, in Aberdeen, 67 per cent.; and in Banffshire 57 per cent. Those three counties are very similar in nature and very similar in industry; they are mostly dependent on agriculture and fisheries. Why should Banffshire suffer? We need some urgent action to give us a hand. The discrepancy is bound to widen as costs continue to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). I should like to refer to the latest education budget for Banffshire. In one year, for a total population of some 50,000, the education budget has gone up by no less than £57,000. That is well over £1 per head of the population. Taking into account the equalisation grant, it is equivalent to a rate increase of nearly 1s. in the £. The total education bill for Banffshire for 1965–66 is well
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
over £1 million—£1,174,000. This is a colossal bill, and it is a colossal rise in one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other expenditure is also bound to rise. In spite of what hon. Members opposite say, the present Government must bear some share of the blame for these increases. In a county like Banffshire there is a tremendous amount of roadage, a tremendous mileage which has to be covered by county vehicles in carrying out the duties of various local authority departments. The punitive increase in fuel tax is an added burden, the taxation on vehicles and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reckoned that the increase in rates throughout the country will be something like 10 per cent. It is definite that Scotland will not be immune, and I personally quarrel with the figures of the Under-Secretary of State for the expected rate increase in this current year. It will affect more particularly the more remote areas, not only because of the difficulties which I have mentioned but because of the declining population, because we are losing potential wage earners and therefore people who are potential ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various suggestions have been made this morning about the collection of money from the traditional rating method. One suggestion which is not new but on which I should like the Government to have second thoughts is the retention of the road fund tax levied by the county. In Banffshire, we are licensing some 1,000 to 1,500 vehicles a year, even in a population of 50,000. I do not suggest that this would be a permanent remedy, but it would certainly be of interim help to local authorities, particularly authorities of the sort to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, in a letter to me on 23rd February this year, referred to the bigger problems of local government finance which are at present under review. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This review takes in the whole pattern of grant and rate levels and an examination of the rating system, and, as I indicated in the debate on the General Grant Order on 15th December, this should help us to get the facts we require to achieve a solution of the problem of central and local Government expenditure."</p></blockquote>
May we know when we are likely to have knowledge of this review, and may we have an undertaking that urgent action will be taken?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I make an urgent plea to the Government to take the local authorities with them the whole way along the road. I hope and trust that the Bill which the Under-Secretary of State mentioned, when it is produced, will not be a hotchpotch Measure because local authorities do not want to be made a shuttlecock between the various parties. We cannot afford continually to have changes, and changes just for the sake of change. Let us, then have an assurance from the Government—indeed, we on this side ask for it—that they will take the local authorities with them in formulating their plans so that the Bill will not be one which needs constant amendment or one on which the Government have second or even third thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State put his finger on the most important part of the debate. He asked for suggestions about how the problem might be tackled and solved. I do not think that it serves any great purpose to make long attacking speeches. We are faced with something which hon. Members on both sides agree is extremely difficult and unfair and which has persisted for a very long time. The speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) was full of histrionic ability and his delivery was magnificent, but I could not recommend it for its content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He made a very good speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a good speech in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with two simple questions: first, how should we raise money for local purposes, and secondly, in what fields should we spend money locally? The Liberal Party has been very consistent in its advocacy of local government reform, and I want to touch briefly on some of the reforms which we have proposed and to bring them again to the attention of the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have consistently said that the burden of education—and I will not dwell on this matter because it has been mentioned by the hon. Members for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and Banff (Mr. Baker)—is too heavy for local authorities to bear and that certain parts of it—teachers' salaries, for example—should be vested in the central Government. This is accepted by
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the Labour Party, but I should like to see specific proposals for its being undertaken within a measurable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find in my county that one of the direct results of the setting up of the pulp mill is a cut-back in expenditure on education. Improvements in schools like Kingussie, for example, which were to have gone ahead and were authorised some years ago, have been delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have frequently said that it is wrong that empty buildings in the centres of towns should be free from rates. We know that there is a device whereby, after a certain time, the local council can obtain a return on rates from such buildings, but we feel that one reason why so many derelict buildings in the centres of towns are kept in that condition is that this allows the value of the building to grow, thereby enabling the owner to get something out of it which he ought not to be getting. This would not seem to require fundamental legislation. Practical steps could be taken here which would help to alleviate the existing rate burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Liberal Party has been consistent in saying that in the long term we should try to devise a system whereby the site and not the building is rated. The hon. Member for Banff made some detailed criticisms of the anomalies which inevitably result from the existing rating system. I did not agree with his remarks about a poll tax; I agree with the Under-Secretary about that. I would call the Minister's attention to the Whit-stable survey, which is not necessarily applicable to the whole country but which demonstrated successfully that if the tax is applied to the site rather than to the building there is a more equitable distribution of tax. We have frequently said this, and it bears directly on the question of rising land values. Many people in my part of the world are taking advantage of this rise, although they have done little to contribute to the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the remarks of the Minister about the Allen Committee Report. He was justified in his agument that the previous Administration had not required that Committee to produce specific recommendations on rating reform. However, the hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
proceeded to make a number of comparisons with the Scandinavian system. I was interested in this, because the Liberal Party had a long look at the question in connection with its relationship to development Authorities and regionalisation. I ask the Minister whether he ought not to look at the reform of local government finance in terms of the likely future regional pattern. The Kommunes in Norway, for instance, had much greater freedom in raising money. The Highland Panel produced an interesting report about this, and I urge the Minister to consider the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee, or to prevent the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) from speaking. Having mentioned education, I now turn to the question of council house rents. This question was raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) who emphasised how difficult and complex the problem was. We are all inclined to speak somewhat superficially about it at times. What is a council house? It is a house built by a local authority for people at a rent which they can afford. This is accepted by both sides. Both sides also accept the principle of subsidisation and that many people must be subsidised in respect of their rents because otherwise the poor devils would have no house to live in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is: what do we do at the other end of the scale? In my county there is a rent surcharge scheme which contains many anomalies and which has been subject to certain criticisms. I ask the Under-Secretary whether the Government themselves do not have a responsibility in endeavouring to give local authorities some indication of a fair rent structure. Some people talk about an economic rent, but that is a totally arbitrary figure. The rent must be fixed at a certain level. Hence, if we say that certain people should pay an economic rent we are also speaking of a totally arbitrary figure because there are no standards by which we can judge. It is clear that in these circumstances there will have to be some grading system in respect of those paying less than an economic rent. Perhaps it could be done through P.A.Y.E., but there would certainly have to be some method of extension of the rent rebate system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
The Government have some responsibility for working out schemes which they can present to local authorities in order to help them to deal with this extremely complex social problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with other hon. Members in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on his excellent speech. In reply to the comments made by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) about the Votes, I would point out that the three Votes had just been read out before my hon. Friend rose, and it was clear that they enabled a wide-ranging debate to take place on local government expenditure. This my hon. Friend proceeded to open extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker). My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries has great personal knowledge of local government affairs, and I sympathise with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banff about the formula for the distribution of the general grant. I commend this point for consideration by the Government because it needs to be looked at when reviews are taking place. Some local authorities feel that the formula is unfair to them—although I realise that it is difficult to devise a formula about which somebody does not complain. The hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) made a powerful speech, but I disagree with much of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary made a speech which could be divided into two. On one part, in which he dealt with the Scottish Office part of his brief, we would agree with much of what he said. The other, where he needed a Labour Party brief, he found much more difficult. He found it hard to explain the documents put out by his party before last October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He mentioned the question of the cost of living rising during the last 13 years of Conservative administration. I will give him what he described as friendly admonition. I will use his own expression about a greasy pole. I would point out to him that if the cost of living rises at the rate at which it has risen in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
last eight months it will rise a great deal more quickly than it did in the period of which he spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the Committee have expressed their support for a careful review of the possibility of some expenditure being borne by the central Government, through the taxpayers, rather than by local government through the ratepayers. The position of both parties was more or less the same on this question last October. The Conservative Party stated in its manifesto:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the light of these studies we shall ensure that the cost of local government, and particularly of education, is fairly apportioned between ratepayers and taxpayers."</p></blockquote>
Excerpts from the Labour Party manifesto have been read out. I will merely paraphrase what it said. It said that consideration would be given to part of the education expenditure being transferred to the Exchequer. It did make the further point, however, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the reform of the rate system and investigation of alternative forms of local government finance may take some time to accomplish, we shall seek to give early relief to ratepayers by transferring a larger part of the burden of public expenditure from the local authorities to the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
The Conservatives had set up the Allen Committee and had started a departmental review of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both parties said that reviews of the whole system should take place, but the Labour Party had said that in the meantime there would be early relief. If that means anything at all it must mean that there would be early relief. It certainly gave that impression. Scottish ratepayers who read that and who thought they understood it did not expect the rates to increase at the rate at which they are likely to increase this year and next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Upon this point the Under-Secretary raised a quibble. He said that my hon. Friend mentioned the words "early" and "immediate" in connection with the same thing. My impression was that he did not; he mentioned "early" in relation to the statement in the Labour Party manifesto, and "immediate" in relation to the inducements in respect of housing in 	<i>Signposts for Scotland.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member can see it in HANSARD tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That quibble was wholly irrelevant, because on page 10 the Labour Party Manifesto states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of Wales and Scotland the Labour Party has already made clear what needs to be done by issuing the policy statement 'Signposts to the New Wales' and 'Signposts for Scotland'."</p></blockquote>
So 	<i>Signposts for Scotland</i> is, in effect, an annex to the Labour Party Manifesto. They are both clearly pledges which were made before the Election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were to be early relief the opportunity for giving it occurred on 15th December, when the general grant orders for the general grant period of two years were before the House. We debated this at the time. Admittedly the Government had been in office for only two months, but if they were to carry out the early relief that they had promised that was the opportunity to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why was it that not a single local authority at the local authority associations' meeting objected to the Government not having done this? Why did not a single local authority ask a Member of Parliament to raise this matter in the House? Was it because they adopted a fairer attitude than did the hon. Member and his friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I will tell the hon. Member exactly why. The Government were following the system that we had been carrying out satisfactorily for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now turn to the point in respect of which the Joint Under-Secretary has misunderstood what we are saying. We are not blaming him for not acting on 15th December. I made it clear in the House that it would have been imprudent for a change to have been made then. In replying to the debate the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One does not legislate in advance of the facts".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th December, 1964; Vol. 704, c. 278.]</p></blockquote>
That was his excuse. He said that the Conservatives had set in train a review of the whole question of local government, and that it was not possible to legislate in advance of the facts. Our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
complaint is that that should have been put in the Manifesto. Instead of the promise of early relief, after speaking of a review, the Manifesto should have gone on to say that it was not possible to legislate before the facts were known. Our complaint is not with what the Government decided to do on 15th December, but with what they said beforehand they would do in their Manifesto. What they said they would do has not been related to what they have in the event done. Our complaint, therefore, is that they mislead those who read their Manifesto before last October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Are Governments not returned on an all-embracing programme covering the span of five years of Parliament?

The Allen Committee has been mentioned and the most significant part of it from Scotland's point of view appears at the end of its conclusions, where it states.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The high level of rates in Scotland matches the low level of rents; indeed, one subsidises the other."</p></blockquote>
That is a conclusion. I was asked why the Allen Committee did not make any recommendations. I suggest that that quotation is as near to a recommendation as one could get. If the Committee had gone on to say that that should be put right—that the distortion should be altered and that rents and rates should be brought to a proper level—hon. Gentlemen opposite would probably not have taken kindly to such a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Question Time in the House we have had one or two sallies on this subject and both the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary have indicated that they now have a somewhat enlightened policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly more enlightened than the previous Administration's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having found themselves in office with responsibility for these matters they now are prepared to encourage some local authorities to improve their housing rent policies. During the Questions and Answers we have had in the House the Under-Secretary has expressed the view that it was our fault that nothing was done earlier to correct the position. That is interesting and a new view from the party opposite because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
I remember that when the Secretary of State was exercising his powers of starting inquiries into the rent policies of certain local authorities and making his own views clear, hon. Gentlemen opposite then accused us of doing far too much in this direction. And when, in 1963, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act was passed there were strong complaints from hon. Gentlemen opposite about the provisions for forfeiture of some grant where there were deficits of over a certain amount of housing accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary rightly said that that legislation was based on the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee of the House. The Committee was worried about the amount of Exchequer money as well as rate money involved in this, but before hon. Gentlemen opposite, particularly the hon. Member for Paisley criticise the Public Accounts Committee too much, they should make an effort to find out whether the right hon. Gentleman the present Prime Minister was in the Chair of that Committee at the time. The party opposite made it clear that it was very much against our legislation of 1963, which put certain penalties on local authorities which ran into too large housing deficits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Under-Secretary to give answers to two specific questions. First, will he say how the word "immediate" is to be interpreted and when the pledge to which it relates is to be carried out; that is, in connection with the words appearing on page 18 of 	<i>Signpost for Scotland,</i> in which it is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While our long term plans are being worked out local authorities will be given immediate inducements to step up their housing programmes".</p></blockquote>
Secondly, on the point made by the hon. Member for Paisley, is the Exchequer equalisation grant system—and I regret that time does not allow me to go into the intricacies of the formula—unfair to Scotland compared with England, since the majority of local authorities in Scotland receive Exchequer equalisation grant whereas it is the minority which receive in England the equivalent, namely, rate deficiency grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Official Opposition are determined that we should have a hot,
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
full-steam-ahead debate and as strong a discussion as possible this morning. I regret that the back benches opposite have not sustained the force of the discussion we were to have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) will be pleased to hear that I hope to deal with the constructive points which have been made before coming to the more pyrotic parts of the debate. It is important to deal with the constructive parts rather than the sparks which have arisen out of discussing tiny matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) has had a hard time with the brief he must carry at the moment, but I regret to say that he has been rather unfair of late, particularly since we debated the general grant. At any rate, mechanically, his Ministers could have done no better than we have been able to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reference should not have been in the manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time is short and I must try to answer all the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness asked a number of specific questions. We have, irrespective of origin, looked at every possible suggestion on this matter to see what could be done. I do not know whether the previous Administration were so broadminded. On the question of the rating of empty buildings, under Section 17 of the Valuation and Rating Act, 1956, this can be done in Scotland, but in practice it is difficult for local authorities to prove that property is being unreasonably left empty. I recall with affection that Act of 1956 because it was the first time I had served on a Committee. As I say, it is difficult for local authorities to prove that property is being left unreasonably unoccupied and this is a weakness into which we are looking. The matter is being closely studied, although I do not suggest that we have yet found a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the proposed rating of site values, when the Government introduce their land commission Bill I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness will see that we are attempting to tackle this problem, but in a rather different way. However, it is important that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
should deal with this point and I think that there is common ground between us on this issue. Site value rating for all ratepayers, payable even though the ratepayer has no intention of selling his property at a really high price, would cause many difficulties, but I hope that when the Government introduce the Measure to which I referred it will be seen that we are anxious to deal with this problem, though perhaps in a different way from that mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good point was made about the regional pattern of Government. This is an important matter that we must bear in mind. When he spoke about rents, the hon. Member for Inverness was kind enough to suggest that perhaps the Government should be responsible for indicating a fair rent structure. I assure him that we shall not be so cowardly as hon. Gentlemen were when they were in Government. Whatever the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) may say about local authorities having as near economic rents as possible, hon. Gentlemen opposite never had the guts to introduce legislation to ensure that. Their 1963 legislation was not designed to raise rents but to cut Exchequer grants because those authorities which raised their rents still lost their grants. That is the political dishonesty of hon. Gentlemen opposite when they argue about economic rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there is a case for having fair rents. The Rent Bill, which we shall be debating later on the Floor of the House, seeks to set up a structure whereby—with agreement wherever possible between fair landlords and tenants—over rents in the uncontrolled sector this can take place. Perhaps that will reflect itself later in the controlled sector and, ultimately, in local authority rents, but that remains to be seen. If, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart suggested, rents were set at £1 a week in Glasgow, there would still need to be a rate contribution of £700,000 or 8d. on the rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall that in response to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson), the hon. Gentleman said precisely that. Either I am going deaf or HANSARD will have a beanfeast tomorrow.
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
My understanding was that the hon. Gentleman said that he would willingly accept £1 as a rent for every house in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. An average rent for all houses in Glasgow, old and new, might have been the point to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart was referring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite should remember that that would mean that every time the local authority in Glasgow completed another 5,000 houses a year, the deficit would grow because it would have to be shared by the people living in the existing stock of houses as well as those in the new ones. So the £500,000 each year would have to be added on. Is that the Tory Party's solution to the problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, of course, hon. Gentlemen opposite have no idea, after 13 years in Government and some time in opposition, of what should be done about local government reform. For this reason the reform which we are conducting could not be conducted by a better party. We are determined to consider the fundamental problems involved and to change what needs to be changed. We cannot patch up the system here and there—as the party opposite tried to do for 13 years—till the system falls flat on its face. Action is needed and even the supporters of the Conservative Party demanded that action should be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) whether we mean to go back to direct grants. He mentioned what we stated when in Opposition about the general grant procedure. We gave one specific pledge in our manifesto on this issue and that is part of the Government's policy. It is to introduce a special grant for education. We are examining that matter now and what form it should take. We are also examining what should be done with the other services in connection with the general grant. The whole matter of the equalisation grant is being overhauled because it is essential that we have some form of proper relationship between local authorities and their different rating resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff asked me specifically about Banff and I was surprised at the sympathy expressed on this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
issue by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn. When in office his party did not do much about it and I do not remember any great cry from them that the system should be changed in respect of counties like Banff. After all, what was the big fact which blocked hon. Gentlemen opposite from helping Banff? It was, and still is, the fact that the average household rate bill in Banff is £21 7s. In the County of Aberdeen it is £25 7s. and the Scottish average is over £30. Hon. Gentlemen opposite will find little comfort in the Allen Report on this issue when we think in terms of places like Banff. The Government are indeed sympathetic, for there are many Banffs, so to speak, in Scotland. We must look at this matter with greater sympathy than was shown by the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff suggested a local tax on vehicles. That idea must be considered and I assure him that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government has declared that the matter should be considered. It is under consideration now. The hon. Gentleman said that we should introduce a Measure which would take the politics
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
out of politics. We cannot do that. We must take local authorities with us as far as we can. We must try to persuade them that the conclusions which we reach are perhaps the most sensible in the circum stances. We will do this in our negotiations with them in the summer. We shall then present a Bill to Parliament. We consider that that is the best way to proceed. I would not be so presumptuous as to say that the Bill which we shall introduce will be immutable or will be like the Valuation Act which, it was stated by the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, when he was Minister, would last for a hundred years. Our Local Government Bill will not last for a century. Circumstances change and laws must be amended. Nevertheless, our Bill will last much longer than a great deal of the legislation we have had in recent years. We intend to make a fundamental reform, including considering the general grant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
