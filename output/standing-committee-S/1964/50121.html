	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Education (Scotland) Bill has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
Its purpose is to amend the provisions of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, which authorise the making of regulations for the introduction of a pension scheme for the widows and dependants of teachers. The main effect of this amendment will be to allow the regulations to provide for the payment of temporary pensions in cases where a teacher dies in the early years of service leaving a widow with children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, it has not been possible until now for a sufficient measure of agreement to be reached about an acceptable basis for a widows' and dependants' scheme. I think that we all agree that the absence of such a scheme is a most serious deficiency in the conditions of service of the teaching profession. For many years the teachers were prepared to accept only a scheme paid for by equal contributions from employers and employees. The local authorities, on the other hand, took the view that widows' pensions should be provided within the existing cost of the main superannuation scheme by reducing other benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This latter arrangement was, of course, the one followed in 1953, when a pension scheme was introduced for the widows of local government employees. It has always been recognised, therefore, that it would be very difficult for the local authorities to accept greater obligations for one particular group of their employees—the teachers—than for the rest of their staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily, the deadlock on the provision of a widows' scheme for teachers was broken in 1962 by the Working
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Party on Pensions for Teachers' Widows. The Report of that Working Party outlined the basis for a contributory scheme which, although not a shared cost one in the sense I have just mentioned, would be comparable in cost to the teachers with the shared cost scheme in the Civil Service and, in some respects, more advantageous in the benefits it provided. This solution depended on the teachers' additional contributions for widows' pensions attracting Income Tax relief and the cost of the administration of the scheme being borne by employers. This would make the net cost of the scheme to the teachers about the same as that paid by civil servants, with whom the teachers had consistently compared themselves in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the legislation of that time, however, the only way of meeting the cost of pensions for teachers' widows and dependants was by the reduction of the existing superannuation benefits. In order to allow for the introduction of a scheme on the financial basis suggested by the Working Party the Education (Scotland) Act was amended in 1963. At the same time it was suggested to the teachers and the local authority associations—who readily agreed—that a working group of teachers, local authority and Departmental officials should be established to formulate the details of a scheme on the basis suggested by the Working Party. This, of course, would be without prejudice to the holding of the formal consultations which my right hon. Friend must have with them under the Act before a widows' and dependants' scheme could be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working out of a detailed scheme was a most complex task which demanded much patience and skill, but the scheme produced by the Working Group is, in the view of my right hon. Friend, as suitable as anything that can be devised within the framework outlined by the Working Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to take this opportunity of expressing on behalf of my right hon. Friend his appreciation to the members of the Working Party and of the Working Group for giving us the benefit of their time and experience and for providing the possibility of a solution to what has, until now, proved to be an intractable problem. My right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
hon. Friend takes particular pleasure—which, I am sure, will be shared by the Committee—that this solution should have been pioneered in Scotland. The Committee may like to know that since the Scottish Working Party Report was published, a Working Party in England and Wales has been preparing, for consideration by the bodies concerned, a scheme of pensions for the widows and dependants of teachers in England and Wales on a similar basis to the Scottish one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage I should perhaps explain that, after the Working Group had completed its task by preparing a scheme, my right hon. Friend formally consulted the representatives of the local authorities and teachers about the introduction of the Working Group's scheme, as he is required to do under the Education (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has now had the views of the various bodies concerned. I am glad to say that the local authority associations and the E.I.S. favour the introduction of the proposed scheme. The local authority associations have also told my right hon. Friend that they will accept their share of the administrative costs of the scheme and he is very grateful to them for their willingness to co-operate in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say, however, that the Scottish Schoolmasters Association and the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association take different attitudes to the scheme from that of the E.I.S. The S.S.A. make two points: first, that steps should be taken to help older teachers to participate because of the cost of covering their past service, and, secondly, that the support of serving male teachers should be determined by means of a plebiscite. The S.S.T.A., for its part, has rejected the scheme but says that if its objection is overruled, there should be a plebiscite of all male teachers before the scheme is introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of a subsidy for existing teachers was debated on the Education (Scotland) Bill in 1963 and was also raised with my right hon. Friend by the E.I.S. at an earlier stage. The scheme is optional for teachers in service and will give individual teachers entering it discretion as to how much of their past service in excess of the proposed compul-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
sory minimum of 10 years they wish to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a new scheme like this is introduced it is inevitable that participation should be less easy for older persons to the extent that the cost of covering service previous to its introduction must be met within the limited period of service remaining to them. It is for individual serving teachers to decide, in the light of such other insurance provision as they may have made when no public scheme was available and of their own circumstances generally, whether, and to what extent, participation in the scheme would be advantageous to them. My right hon. Friend feels, therefore, that the proposed scheme would be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of older teachers and that one cannot accept the suggestion that there should be a special contribution from public funds to enable them to participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of holding a plebiscite, my right hon. Friend does not think that there are good grounds for considering such a step. He has consulted the teachers' organisations in fulfilment of the statutory requirement to consult representatives of the teachers. He has weighed the views expressed by them on behalf of their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The largest teachers' organisation—the one which has within its membership over two-thirds of the men teachers who are in the main organisations and the one which has concerned itself most closely over a very long period with the whole problem of widows' pensions—has intimated that it is in favour of the introduction of the scheme. It has done so after the closest examination of the detailed provisions that have been worked out and after considering the practicable alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have seen the report in the 	<i>Scottish Educational Journal</i> just before Christmas. I think it was clear that the E.I.S. had considered all the possibilities and was pleased to accept the scheme. This, coupled with the fact that the lack of a widows' pension scheme is a most serious omission from the conditions of service of teachers in Scotland, has convinced my right hon. Friend that he should proceed with the proposed scheme. It will afford protection to the families of teachers on conditions which the majority of teachers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
regard as being as good as they can reasonably expect to obtain, and no individual serving teacher who thinks otherwise is under any obligation to enter the scheme. My right hon. Friend therefore proposes to take steps towards introducing a widows' and dependants' scheme by issuing the necessary draft regulations as soon as possible. He expects this to be at the beginning of next month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given hon. Members an outline of the background, I come to the proposals of the very short Bill we are considering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members may know, the normal pattern of widows' pensions in public service schemes is that pensions should be provided only where the person has completed 10 years' service. The Working Group, to which I have referred earlier, felt, however, that, with the trend towards earlier marriage, a 10-year qualifying period was unduly long for teachers. The provision of pensions for life for women widowed at an early age was, however, felt to be inappropriate, and it would be very expensive. Another possibility considered was the payment of a death gratuity, but it was found that there would be Inland Revenue complications about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After careful consideration, it seemed that the form of benefit which would provide valuable cover at relatively low cost was something along the lines of the National Insurance widowed mother's allowance. This is payable only to widows who have dependent children, and it ceases when all the children become self-supporting. These conditions of payment normally make sure that such pensions are payable only to those who really need them and that they continue only so long as there is a need for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Working Group recommended that this form of benefit should be provided for widowed mothers. Since it could not be included in the proposed scheme which it had been asked to draw up, because of the qualifying period of 10 years laid down in the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, it stressed that the necessary amending legislation should be sought at the earliest opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 of the Bill accordingly provides for the removal of the requirement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
in paragraph 20 of Schedule 3 to the Education (Scotland) Act that a teacher must have been in service for 10 years before a pension can be paid for his widow and other dependants. As a result of the change proposed in the Clause it will be possible for widowed mothers' allowances to be paid. This provision, I know, will be welcomed by everybody as providing a useful protection in the particularly tragic cases of teachers who die leaving young wives and dependent children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the draft regulations for a widows' scheme which, as I have mentioned, my right hon. Friend expects to issue at the beginning of next month, it is proposed that a widowed mother's pension should be payable where a teacher dies after at least three years' service leaving a widow and a dependent child under 19. The widowed mother's pension will range from £58 to £106 per annum, according to the number of years' service of the teacher, and the children's pensions will vary from £60 where there is only one child to £210 where there are four or more. We all recognise that these sums are modest, but, together with National Insurance benefits, they will make a real contribution towards a widow's security in those, fortunately rare, cases where a teacher dies in the prime of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also mention that the present requirement in the Act that there must have been 10 years' service before there is any entitlement to pension applies not only to any widows' and children's pension scheme but also to any scheme for other dependants. In the draft regulations which my right hon. Friend is proposing to issue there are also provisions for the payment of pensions to other dependants of teachers; for example, to a mother who is maintained by a daughter who is a teacher. As a result of the changes proposed in this Bill it will also be possible for dependants' pensions to be paid where the teacher concerned dies after having had less than 10 years' service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given hon. Members an outline of the background of the Bill, an indication of its purpose, and how we intend to use the provisions for the draft regulations which we shall be issuing shortly. As will be realised from what I have said, the proposal to grant pensions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
in respect of only three years' service is a quite new feature of public service superannuation. I can think of no better group of people than widowed mothers for whom this change should be made, and I therefore commend this small but very deserving Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McInnes. I was on my feet to ask whether my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, before she sat down, would agree to add a little further information in reply to a question I wanted to ask of her. I am sorry that that step was cut out, as it has been cut out for my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) by the unexpected intervention of the Chair at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the hon. Lady had already sat down by the time the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) got to his feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this Bill which, as the Under-Secretary has said, is a small but very important contribution to a particularly important subject. Its extremely important purpose is to cover the small but important section of the community whom we were unable to deal with in the 1963 Measure. Its clear purpose is to provide for that section a small but important pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is important is that this Bill will undoubtedly have a certain effect on the recruitment of teachers, and will, therefore, to some degree alleviate the shortage about which we have all felt great concern. There is no doubt that there has long been in the minds of teachers and those considering entering the profession anxieties in regard to pension and pension rights. I would join the hon. Lady in congratulating the Working Party on having secured the agreement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
which is the basis of this Bill. It is also important to remember that the status of teachers is, perhaps, paramount in the minds of the teaching organisations themselves; and that an adequate pension scheme today is, perhaps, one of the most important considerations which professional associations have in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is apparent that agreement has not been entirely easy to reach, because it has taken a considerable time to work out a basis acceptable to all concerned. The professional associations have, I think, expressed to us all their doubts about the Bill, but I think that they ought to be satisfied with this scheme, as it is voluntary, and, therefore, if teachers are unable to accept the terms of the scheme they are not compelled to enter into it. That should be made quite clear to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be wise to make clear to them that this Bill has not been arrived at overnight. It is, in fact, some ten years since some of us concerned with this problem made efforts towards a solution. It was deal with, first, in the 1962 Act, and is dealt with again now. The hon. Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) and myself were concerned in a special recommendation to the Secretary of State on the subject of pensions, the object of which was to emphasise its importance to the teaching profession as a whole. In 1958 and in 1962 there were consistently put forward recommendations for pensions benefits, and some form of agreement between the profession and the Government of the day such as we were able to put forward in the 1963 Act, paragraph 20 of the Third Schedule to which this Bill amends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On of the best features of the Bill must be this inclusion of provisions for other dependants. I do not think that people appreciate sufficiently the coverage offered by this Measure. The provision for other dependants is of a particular importance in a profession which has within it so many women, and so many women who are responsible for sick mothers and others whom they must look after. I am sure that this provision will be of the utmost importance to them. The removal of the requirement of 10 years' service will be of particular satisfaction to those people, many of whom may have to give up teaching within that period in order to look after sick relatives for whom they are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
I therefore feel that, as the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary has said, this Bill is a most important contribution to the teaching profession in Scotland. It should be a satisfaction to most of us in this Room—at least, to those of us who are Scottish—that this is an aspect of pensions for teachers pioneered in Scotland, and something to which many people have given thought and effort. I welcome this important small Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) rather embarrassed me by her reference to the fact that we jointly took certain courses of action. While I welcome this very short Bill, I must express my deep regret and disappointment that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has not seen fit to go much deeper into the whole question of the provision of teachers' pensions. As the hon. Member for Renfrew, East has said, it is a very serious aspect of the problem of recruiting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said to me, as I am sure it has been said to other hon. Members, that when people nowadays enter the larger commercial or industrial undertakings they are assured of non-contributory pension schemes not only covering the individual himself but making provision for widows and dependants. I was, therefore, rather surprised to hear my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State indicate that there was difficulty in arriving at a better pension scheme for teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind her that many years ago the Glasgow Education Authority recommended the payment of a contribution pari passu with the teachers for the specific purpose of providing for dependants, at a rate of 1¼ per cent. of salary. Bearing in mind that Glasgow employs a quarter, or even more than a quarter, of the whole teaching staff in Scotland, that was a very valuable indication of how seriously we in the west of Scotland regarded this question of providing adequately for the widows and dependants of teachers. At the present time, pensions are provided by means of contributions of 6 per cent. from the education authorities and 6 per cent. from the teachers' salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I was seeking to do when you ruled me out of order, Mr. McInnes,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
was to seek elucidation of the following point. In this whole matter of the provision of teachers' widows' pensions nobody has made any additional contribution to the total sum in the fund. It therefore means that if a teacher is to get this coverage he loses something if, fortunately, he is not required to take advantage of the scheme. In that respect, we are doing absolutely nothing except to make it permissible for a teacher to say whether he desires to have less money when he retires by virtue of having insurance in the event of his not completing his total period of service and drawing pension. In doing that, he is getting nothing out of it at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this Bill does is to empower teachers to choose whether or not to take part in this scheme, but in a period when there is a growing and massive shortage of teachers such things as conditions of service, salaries and pensions are of paramount importance. It concerns us all, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend and the Government share that concern. We ought to have gone much further into the whole question. If we really mean to do something for the teachers we should have done more than simply allow them to rearrange the amount of money they will get. We should have gone into the question of how far local authorities should be asked to make an additional contribution along with the teachers themselves. As far as I am aware, the teachers in Scotland would accept such a proposition, and would be quite willing to agree to something which made adequate and reasonable provision for widows and dependants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a pension scheme which meets the demand of the time. We cannot do anything at this stage, I know, but I hope that this Bill does not represent the end of very active consideration of teachers' pensions. I agree that we would be putting the teachers in a particular category, but we are here dealing with one of the most serious problems of our generation—the serious drift in our children's education which is causing great harm. Any financial step which would help to mitigate that unfortunate position should be given serious thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This additional expenditure of £1,000 clearly indicates how little is being done in this regard—and local authorities have to carry some of the burden. I hope this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
will not be the end of the matter, and that very soon we shall have a Bill which will do justice to the teachers and enable us to resolve the critical problem of the shortage of teachers in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) gave her approval to the Bill. That carries a certain comfort, because we can all agree that hers is one of the most acute minds in this Committee, and particularly on the other side. I, too, welcome the Bill but, like my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern), I welcome it with certain qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that this is a small Bill, and its smallness is emphasised by the following sentence in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only effect of the Bill on public funds will be to increase the cost of administration by an amount not exceeding £1,000 a year."</p></blockquote>
That, to me, seems to set the background against which the Bill is framed. I do not think today it is for a Measure such as this, in view of the background against which education, in the schools and elsewhere, is being carried on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that the term "public funds" is misleading in that connection? That refers only to Government funds. Public funds also include the contribution made via the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to answer questions which my right hon. Friend knows perfectly well should be addressed to the Front Bench. I am certain that when my hon. Friend replies she will deal with that point and give us what, I hope, will be an adequate answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was merely drawing attention to a contrast and referring to the background against which education must be viewed today. There are many complications in schools. Teachers are dealing with children who, according to their birth dates, are 12, 13 or 14, although in many cases they are three or four years older, .not only in the physical sense but also in the mental sense. That places an added strain on the teaching staff. It demands that teachers' minds should be cleared as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
far as possible of the financial worries which today beset many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East pointed out how the Bill now brings in other dependants. I recollect from my own experience the case of a teacher who taught in one of the schools where I taught before I became a Member of Parliament. Her sister was a widow with a family of six children. When her sister died, that teacher undertook the upbringing of those six children. She remained on at teaching—when salaries were considerably less than they are today. In the long run the strain of bringing up six children on a teacher's salary of prewar days shortened her life. But it was a noble task, nobly undertaken under the greatest possible difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has to know such things. One comes to know them, sometimes, only too late to be of help. If a Bill of this nature can in any way reduce this worry about the future, even in a small way, it must be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reminded of this forcefully last week when, in the course of doing what, I am sure, all hon. Members will agree is part of our duties in the Recess, I visited the industries in my division. I spent a week visiting some of the industries in Govan. During the previous few weeks very good news indeed had come to Govan and to Clydeside. Security had come. When I spoke to the men at the machines I learned that not one of them was thinking in terms of higher wages. They all said to me, "We have work for the next three years". They had security. That was a most interesting thing to hear. We are always told that men in the yards are in continual dispute with the bosses, and sometimes with society, about wages. The basic thought I found, in some very large industries employing 6,000 men, was the fact that for three years they could see security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers are no more exempt from that attitude than are men in industrial occupations. The issue is, has that been kept fully in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what has been said about the pension contribution, because I can well remember the occasion when it was decided to raise the teacher's contribution from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. My
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), now the Secretary of State for Scotland, my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison), now the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, and I were added to that United Kingdom committee to resist the increase in the teacher's contribution from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. We took a very serious view of that. We must aim at a reduction, or, if necessary, a non-contributory scheme, because that is more and more becoming a feature of most industrial occupations—at a certain level, I agree. The non-contributory scheme and the guarantee of security, not only in the present but for the future, is a great asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was referred to as a small Bill. When one gets down to trying to follow all the Acts precedent to the Bill one finds that it is anything but a small Bill or an easy task. One finds that paragraph 20 of the Third Schedule to the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, is a ghastly paragraph and one of the most complicated Government paragraphs I have seen for a long time. By the time I came to the end of reading it I was completely lost. Perhaps one needs a very acute legal mind to get through from the beginning to the end of this paragraph and know exactly where one is when one reaches the end. I confess that it was not an easy paragraph to read, but I hope that we can all rest on the assurance that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave this morning. The magnitude of the Measure is shown by the number of previous Acts mentioned in the Third Schedule to the 1962 Act, dealing with the financing of the pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend assured us that the local authorities and the E.I.S. accept the Bill. However, she said that there was opposition from the Scottish Schoolmasters Association and from the S.S.T.A. She then said that the Bill was optional—a person has got voluntarily to agree to whatever payment is necessary; There is no compulsion. We have the optional aspect of the Bill and we have the fact that the S.S.A. and the S.S.T.A. have rejected it. I do not know whether "rejected" is too strong a word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that they remain of that conclusion, these are important groups
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
of teachers who have said that they will have nothing to do with the Bill. If there is this optionality in it, how will the finances of the Bill be organised? Will they be an altogether separate part, kept separate from the financing of pensions? Will this be a separate accountability?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally I welcome the Bill. It is a step in the right direction. On that ground we must welcome it. I accept that in the initial stages of what I hope will be their long life, the Government were, perhaps, not able to approach this matter from the radical point of view which some of us on this side would have hoped for. Nevertheless. I give the Bill my blessing. I hope that it will work. I look forward to something even more dramatic and arresting from the Government in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everybody welcomes the Bill generally as a small contribution to making the teaching profession more attractive, and therefore helping recruitment. It is true that the need of the widow and perhaps the children of someone with less than 10 years' service who has an accident may be very great indeed. We had a very sad case recently in Castle Douglas of a young teacher who died as a result of an accident. He left a wife and two children. He had made virtually no provision for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, by the very nature of the teachers' fund the benefits in respect of someone who has served for only a few years cannot be very great. I was agreeably surprised by the figure which the Under-Secretary mentioned, but the benefits are not very great. The scheme can never replace life assurance, which acts on a different principle. It does not depend on the amount paid into the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern), but I would rather ask the corrollary. The contributions made by the teachers have certain Income Tax savings. Will it be possible over the years to increase the benefits for widows and dependants as the fund builds up, thus making the benefits more attractive than they are at present?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns what is to to be the effect of the Bill on other public service pensioners. I believe that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
it is general practice that, in the public service, one does not achieve a pension till one has had 10 years' service. Certainly in this context the pension scheme which we as Members of the House of Commons are shortly to enjoy springs to mind. That depends on 10 years' service. Is there to be a breach of a principle here? If, so, the teachers will have made a great step forward which, perhaps, will be followed in other branches of public service. If that is the case, I welcome it very very much and congratulate the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State on having achieved it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 20 of the Third Schedule to the 1962 Act dealing with the 10-year period refers to a teacher dying
	<br><blockquote><p>"within such period after ceasing to be so employed as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
Does this mean that, if someone has been a Scottish teacher for a minimum of three years, he has a vested right to a pension for his widow and children even if he goes into some other profession? Will he retain that right for the rest of his life?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would say that all this helps to make the teaching profession more attractive and we should, therefore, welcome the Bill very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a member of the Working Party I would like to pay special tribute to the Chairman, Mr. Donnelly. But for his remarkable chairmanship, skill, and perseverance the first meeting of the Working Party would have been the last. I never saw two groups of people so determined not to give away one tiny fraction of their demands. We even had a motion at that first meeting from the teachers' side wanting to end it. I therefore pay my tribute to Mr. Donnelly for the way in which he managed to keep the Working Party going until eventually a solution was arrived at which was acceptable to the bodies representing the vast majority of teachers and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By this Bill we are amending the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, but in addition there is the Education (Scotland) Act, 1963, which contains a Section dealing with financing of the pensions of widows and other dependants of teachers. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) said that one provision in the 1962 Act is very difficult to understand. What will it be like,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
perhaps five years from now, for a person entering the profession when he tries to find out the position regarding pensions? Not only must such a person understand the provision to which my hon. Friend referred, he must understand the whole of the 1962 Act and look up all the amendments to it. He must then study the 1963 Act, because that partly superseded the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, back to the very position which the Government are trying to overcome by proposals for English and Scottish law commissions which will try to make the law of the lands simpler. We have to start somewhere on this simplification, so why add to the confusion by a Bill in this form? Later on, if we pass the Bill in its present form, the law commissions will have to sort out the confusion we are adding. We must try to alleviate the shortage of teachers by giving them something new, but we are also short of qualified people such as lawyers. The Government aim to make laws which the ordinary man in the street can understand. The sensible way to do that—and it will also be a great deal cheaper—is to pass a new Measure superseding all previous Acts on the same subject. Of course it would take a great deal of time in drafting, but that time and energy will have to be spent sooner or later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, if one asks a lawyer a simple question he has to employ a clerk full time for a week to find out what the law is in that particular respect. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Hon. Members may laugh, but I have seen the Town Clerk of Dundee seeking to clarify a point of law about which I have asked him. Ultimately he has had to allocate a clerk to deal with the matter because it has involved so much research. In one case, a clerk spent three days trying to find out the law in a certain respect because it had been amended so often. Now, by the way in which this Measure is drafted, we are to create exactly the same sort of situation again, just at the time when the Government are trying to sort out the complexities of the law and to simplify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long run, it would be simpler and cheaper for everyone to have legislation which superseded all previous Acts on the same subject. Every time we make complicated legislation of this kind—simply amending existing Measures in-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
stead of superseding them—we add to the legal confusion, and it is the man in the street who ultimately has to pay, because legal fees are made dearer than they need be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a few years' time, a new teacher will have to spend hours, days, and possibly weeks, trying to find out his position in relation to pensions. We must make a start somewhere in a business-like way. Every time we amend the law we should reprint the Statutes on the subject as a complete Act, superseding all previous Acts on the subject. As I have said, a future teacher wishing to find out about pensions will have to look up the 1962 Act and its amendments and then the 1963 Act. There may be more amendments I do not know about. In the long run, the cheapest and simplest form of legislation is to introduce a Measure including all previous Acts on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary of State for the clear way in which she gave the Committee the history of this small but rather difficult problem. In the past there has been considerable difficulty among local authorities as to how best they could achieve the purposes of giving teachers what they felt was fair and what they hoped would be an added incentive to join the profession—without, of course, giving them such greatly increased benefits that the local authorities would be in difficulty with their many other types of staff. I join with the hon. Lady in paying my thanks to both the Working Party and the working group which we set up in the last two or three years. I would also join with the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) in thanking Mr. Donnelly, whose skill as a negotiator I remember only too well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, rather easy, and perhaps a habit with all Committees of the House, certainly of the Scottish Grand Committee, if a Bill is a small one and a short one, to say that it should be bigger and longer and more constructive. I have noted the comments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) but I think that we have a right to be moderately pleased, as the hon. Lady has said, with this pioneer work in this field, and that it has started in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is satisfactory that the local authorities and the E.I.S. have agreed with it.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Perhaps in present conditions it would be asking a little too much to expect all the teachers' representatives to agree at once, but I think it is important that it is for the individual teacher to decide whether or not he wants to join the scheme. If he does not want to have anything to do with it he can keep clear of it, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt we shall have the opportunity to look at and possibly debate the regulations when they are laid. Certainly it will be a fairly complicated piece of legislation, as the hon. Lady has suggested, and no doubt we may have views then as to the adequacy or not of the amounts for the different classes of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) when she says that we can look at this Measure as an important asset in the recruitment of teachers. It may be true, as the hon. Member for Dundee, West said, that we are short of lawyers and many other classes of people, but this Committee, at least as long as I have known it, has always been particularly keen to increase the supply of teachers in the knowledge that upon their skill and the skill of the people of Scotland a good deal of our future depends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree when my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East says that this proposal is important particularly in the teaching profession, where, as she rather delicately put it, a good many teachers leave after a fairly short time to look after dependants. It does not matter whether these dependants be their children or their mothers, a great many will, we hope, come back later on and give many years of service. That obviously cannot be guaranteed in the first instance, and it is right that there should be some extra incentive to them to help them because of this feature of their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) raised what is always a problem in dealing with pension schemes of this sort—that other classes of people will be getting different types of pensions. He referred to our own possible pension as Members of Parliament, starting after 10 years' service. I have always felt that one of the problems which the Secretary of State for Scotland,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
and, no doubt, other Ministers from time to time, finds most difficult is that of saying that if one cannot do a thing for one section of the community one must not do it for any other. I have always felt that it was right in a particular case when we are short of teachers to try to give, perhaps, a little lead to the teaching profession over others, and I am delighted that the Secretary of State, through the agreement which has been achieved in the Working Party and the working group, has been able to do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore give the Bill my wholehearted support, and if the hon. Lady can answer one or two of the technical questions which have been asked, and, in due course, produce regulations which we can understand, I am sure that this will be to the benefit of the teaching profession as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By leave of the Committee perhaps I may reply briefly to some of the points raised in the debate. I am glad to know that he Bill is welcomed on both sides of the Committee and that it is realised that anything which can play even a small part in removing any deterrents to people entering the teaching profession is in itself very worth while. The Bill, incidentally, may help to do just that. Its main purpose is to assist those in the profession who might otherwise suffer hardship, but we can hope that it will assist in teacher recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of detailed points have been raised, and some, perhaps, can be dealt with more fully later in Committee, but I would like to answer them briefly now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) wishes that we had gone deeper into the whole question of pensions. I take the point, and I have every sympathy with his feelings. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) made the same sort of submission. Comparisons have been made with people in large firms which have rather more luxurious pension schemes. There is a real difficulty here, and I think that my hon. Friends will appreciate it if I refer them to "Pensions for Teachers' Widows", the Report of the Working Party, and particularly to paragraphs 26 and 27, where this whole question of shared cost schemes was looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
The difficulties which arise are broadly these. According to the Government Actuary's estimates, if one had the principle of shared costs in grant-aided pension schemes, it could not be limited to any scheme in Scotland alone. It would have to be accepted in principle and be extended to many other people in Great Britain as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost on a Great Britain basis, if we took the teachers alone, would be £1·75 million each year, and £25 million, of which the Exchequer's share would be about £1 million and £15 million respectively; but if the principle were extended, as it would have to be, to the whole field of local government staffs, health service employees, and so on, it would be found that the liability of the Government and local authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be increased by £6·75 million annually plus some £105 million for back service."</p></blockquote>
This would be in addition to about £400 million in respect of deficiencies in the existing superannuation schemes which the Government have already met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon Members will agree, this is not something to be undertaken lightly. This is one of the points which has to be taken into consideration in assessing the priorities. The Bill, while making no pretence to be the final answer in any way to the problem of providing really good pensions for teachers and their dependants, is a move in the right direction, and it offers a real solution to a tragic problem affecting the families of a small number of teachers who die at an early age. We can, therefore, welcome the Bill and recognise the large problems which would face us in going as far as my hon. Friend has suggested, and which they hope the Government will deal with one day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that local authorities should be ready to move over to shared cost schemes. My hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston talked about Glasgow's initiative and its willingness, at one time at any rate, to have a shared cost scheme. Glasgow's view is not shared by all education authorities, and it is a fact that other education authorities at the present time are not willing to do this. This is in addition to the national repercussions about which I have spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Govan asked whether the finances of the widows' scheme would be kept separate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
from those of the main scheme. The answer is—yes, they will be kept quite separate. They will be in a fund administered by a board of management, and on that board there will be teachers' representatives who will have a majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked about the complexities of paragraph 20 of that Third Schedule. Our amendment to the Act, as it is contained in the Bill, simplifies the existing text, because it removes the detail to regulations. I think that lawyers do not find such a happy hunting ground among Regulations as they do in Sections of an Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend would look at this again? While it is true that it seems to simplify it, perhaps I might point out that the original legislation refers to first and second class service, whereas the Government's amendment refers only to first class service, to the exclusion of second class service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look at that, and perhaps we can consider it more closely later in Committee. As I said, the regulations will be issued at the beginning of next month. They will, of course, be very complex. They have to be. Any kind of pension scheme contains a complexity which one would like to avoid, but we are, nevertheless, simplifying the legislation itself. I shall, however, consider the point raised by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Govan also referred to the £1,000 contribution as being much too small. I think that perhaps he overlooked the point that what this small Bill does—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may correct my hon. Friend. I do not think that I referred to its being much too small. I used it as providing a contrast between our desires and the aims of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, and release him from the rather more devastating criticism which I was assuming he had made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill extends the range of cover for teachers' families already provided for in the 1962 Act. The total cost to public funds under that provision is estimated to be in the region of £50,000 a year. The striking thing about this small Bill is that there will be no additional cost to the teachers in the extension of the scheme. This relieves us to some extent from the criticism made by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
My hon. Friend also asked how the scheme would be financed if participation in it by teachers were optional; in other words, if some teachers stayed out. The thing to recognise—and this has not been clearly understood everywhere—is that participation in the scheme will be optional only for teachers in service when the scheme starts Once the scheme starts, every new male teacher will go into the scheme. Thus, those already teaching when the scheme begins will have a choice, but the new entrant, after the scheme starts, will be compulsorily included, and it is the participation of such teachers which will provide a guaranteed income. Therefore, the funds will not be threatened if serving teachers stay out of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) had some kind things to say about the Bill, and asked two or three questions. He asked what would happen if a teacher left Scotland. If a teacher leaves Scottish teaching service and goes into some other field of activity he will get his contributions back, with interest. If, however, he leaves to take up a teaching post elsewhere in Great Britain he will retain his entitlement to benefits under the widows' scheme, because there is no reason to suppose that he will not at some time come back to teaching service in Scotland. It is only if he leaves the whole teaching field that he will get his contributions back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether it would be possible to increase benefits under the scheme. The answer is that the board of management—on which the teachers will have a majority—which will be looking after the funds, will no doubt invest the funds, and it may be that any additional income which is produced, which will be tax free, will in time build up to a point where additional benefits might be payable. There will be the maximum opportunity for this to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked to what extent the Bill was a breakthrough in public service schemes. It is a breakthrough, but it is a limited one, to the extent that the contribution period is to apply only to secondary benefits, such as for widows, and not to primary benefits. In the case of primary benefits, it is still a 10-year qualifying period.

I join my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) in the tribute he paid to the Chairman of the committee. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us some indication of the kind of difficulties which are met in trying to bring this kind of idea into being. My hon. Friend was rather sweeping in his suggestions, but again I sympathise with the motives which lay behind what he said. He thought that it would be simple to throw away all the old legislation and have a completely new Bill every time we wished to amend legislation. I wish that it were as simple as that, particularly at the moment, when the Government are seeking to push through their legislative programme as fast as they can to give effect to their policies. However, at this moment we could not impose on our Parliamentary draftsmen the kind of task suggested by my hon. Friend. One hopes that as we move forward this admirable aim will be achieved, but at the moment it would be asking too much, and I think
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
that my hon. Friend will sympathise with the reasons why this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to note the welcome which this small Bill has had this morning. One talks of it as a small Bill because of its limited number of Clauses, but there have been many bigger Bills which have not made so striking a contribution to a particular group of people as is made by this Bill. The Bill may be a small one, but it is, nevertheless, one of real importance and of real help to people who otherwise might suffer and who otherwise would have this insecurity hanging over them during their first years of service in teaching, and I am glad that the Committee has given it such a warm welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
