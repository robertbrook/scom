ARTS AND AMENITIES IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Arts and Amenities in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
It is four years since the Committee last discussed the arts. This is the first debate of its kind under the present Government, and it is a subject in which I have particular responsibilities and a very personal interest. Therefore, I welcome this morning's debate, particularly because it follows the publication last February of the Government's White Paper, "A Policy for the Arts: the First Steps". It is a White Paper which has been received with thankfulness and even a degree of enthusiasm by those who live and work in the world with which it is concerned, not as any kind of final answer, but as a first measure of our concern that the arts should flourish and should be enjoyed.<br><br>
The important thing was, and I think that this has been generally recognised, that among all the pressures of all the problems that faced the Government on assuming office, the White Paper was prepared and published by them and that at a time of acute financial difficulties we have made more money available for the arts. Before I develop this point, I shall say a word about Ministerial responsibilities, because there is, I believe, some confusion about the arrangements in Scotland and the Committee might wish to have the position clarified.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State to the Department of Education and Science is co-ordinating the carrying out of Government policy over the whole field of the arts. Her
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
appointment and the specific remit that she has been given by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister have been warmly welcomed. Men and women working in the wide field of the arts now know that there is within the Government a Minister charged with the task of initiating policy to sustain the arts and to create a context within which they can flourish.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Scotland continues, however, to be responsible for his Ministerial functions in relation to the Scottish national institutions and the Arts Council and its Scottish Committee, and he has taken over responsibility from the Treasury for Ministerial functions concerning the National Library of Scotland. I have immediate responsibility under the Secretary of State for the discharge of these functions, and we have arranged that the Department through which all this will be done will be the Scottish Education Department instead of the old division between the Treasury, the Scottish Home and Health Department and the Scottish Education Department. For the first time, therefore, one Department is dealing with all the Scottish national institutions, with the Secretary of State's interest in the Arts Council and its Scottish Committee, and providing the link with local authorities on the arts.<br><br>
Having clarified that, I turn in more detail to the White Paper. It contains, amongst many other things, the figures which show how the grant to the Arts Council was substantially increased in 1965–66. The Committee may wish to know the figures affecting the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council, because much of what is said this morning will be linked with efforts that the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council is making in Scotland.<br><br>
In the debate in July, 1961, the Government spokesman took credit for the rise in the grant to the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council from £82,000 in 1955-56 to £123,000 in 1961-62. This year, the figure is £255,000. To put it another way, the amount has more than doubled since the last debate, whereas the previous comparison, which was thought by the last Government to be a fairly good one, showed a rise of only 50 per cent, on much smaller figures.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I shall give just one example of what this increase means. Within the budget of £123,000 in 1961–62 the Scottish National Orchestra received £38,000. This year, the orchestra will receive £62,500, a very big jump. There is a great deal in the White Paper which we could spend a lot of time discussing, but time is short and I do not intend to speak at great length.<br><br>
I should like at this stage to refer only to the building fund which is now available for local authorities. It is remarkable that until this year the Arts Council was never able to set aside money to assist efforts by local authorities to house the arts. The total figure which we can afford to offer at present is small—it is £¼million in 1965–66—but it is intended to be a starting point. Up to now, there has been nothing at all.<br><br>
Before anyone asks me what share of this total Scotland is likely to receive, let me say that this is, in the first instance, up to the Scottish local authorities. As I commented at the time the White Paper was published, the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council cannot stake out any Scottish claims in London unless Scottish local authorities come forward with firm and well-prepared proposals. I am sure that Scotland will get a fair share of the building fund if the local authorities concerned act with a fair amount of speed and a good deal of decision. A number of schemes are already under consideration by the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council, but the initiative lies with local authorities and it is now up to them.<br><br>
That was why we decided to follow up the White Paper with Scottish Education Department circular No. 589 addressed specifically to local authorities. Hon. Members will by now have read it. It paid tribute to what is already being done by many local authorities, but it indicated—at least, I hope it did—how much has still to be done. It is certainly true that authorities in general are coming nowhere near the rating limit of 44/5d. which they are entitled to spend under the Local Government Act, 1948.<br><br>
I appreciate, as does everybody else, the heavy rating burdens that have to be faced and all the competing demands within the areas of local authorities, but I emphasise that this is a sphere in which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
a relatively modest outlay can bring a quite disproportionately large return in terms of human happiness and enjoyment. Indeed, most of the suggestions in the White Paper would involve very little expense.<br><br>
There has not been in Scotland a survey comparable to that which was carried out in England and Wales by the Institute of Municipal Entertainment, which was outlined in the last Annual Report of the Arts Council. It showed how much, or how little, local authorities in England and Wales had spent on the arts and on what they called entertainment since the 1948 Act allowed them to spend a proportion of the rates on the arts. The only thing which we can do in Scotland is to form an estimate, and our estimate is that local authorities on average—I emphasise "on average", because, obviously, this conceals wide variations—seem to be spending less than 1d. of the rates on the arts. There is, therefore, a good way to go.<br><br>
I have said that most of the suggestions in the White Paper would involve comparatively little expense. The circular was intended to be a fairly practical guide. Some Of the schemes in it would cost virtually nothing and others very little. The point is that a small contribution by local authorities could make a large difference to, for example, a group of amateur musicians or to small dramatic societies.<br><br>
It might be said that the circular is concerned really with two problems. The first is to improve and strengthen what already exists, and the second is to create new opportunities. I should like to look briefly at both of these and will take the new opportunities first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has spoken about firm and well-prepared proposals. It is easily understandable that in Edinburgh or Glasgow it is easy enough to draw up such proposals, but what help is my hon. Friend giving to smaller local authorities to help them in these tasks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to touch upon that presently, because I recognise that those local authorities need help.<br><br>
One of my particular hopes is that the riches, the joys and the stimulus of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
good theatre, good music and good painting should be brought within the reach of communities which up to now have not known them. In this I am thinking not only of the geographically remote and sparsely populated communities of the Highlands, great as their need is. In passing, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work done in this regard by the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council. What it has done with its directly-provided concerts, and so on, in isolated places is excellent. It has shown its appreciation of the true needs of Scotland by maintaining this policy after it was abandoned in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mentioned what she calls the geographically remote parts of Scotland. Will she say a word about the abuse of power which results in St. Ninian's treasure having been taken from Aberdeen Museum, where it was available for scrutiny by scholars, experts and the general public, and put into the Museum in Edinburgh—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes </span><span class='membercontribution'>:—where it is kept locked up and not available to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The point of an interruption is to ask for clarification, not for information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Steele. Why am I not entitled to put that question to my hon. Friend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite certain, knowing as I do—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. If my hon. Friend seeks to answer my perfectly legitimate question, I hope that you will not call her to order, Mr. Steele. It is a matter of great public interest and is of particular interest to Aberdeen University and to the people of Aberdeen and the people of Shetland, where the treasure was discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order either. I hope that hon. Members will have an orderly debate. That is what I am trying to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend might have done well to wait and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
see whether I proposed to cover that matter in what I said in any event. I think, however, that he will find that at some stage of the morning I shall certainly have something to say about that subject. I recognise how urgently he would wish me to do so. If my hon. and learned Friend will allow me, I do not propose to say it precisely at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have touched upon the Highlands, and perhaps I can escape from them somewhat speedily to return to an even greater need, and that is the needs of communities, the towns and the villages, of our industrial areas. They are closer to the main centres of population but they have no share in the artistic riches which the cities can offer. It is not going too far to say that they produce our wealth but get very little return from the civilisation which it has created.<br><br>
I should like very much to see the development of three possibilities. The first is the arts centre. I emphasise that I am talking about professionalism in the arts and not about amateur activities, which thrive and prosper in many of the industrial villages and towns. I am talking about opportunities for people in communities outside the cities in our industrial areas to hear the best that the professionals can offer in music, theatre, and so on. I should like to see arts centres in cities and towns, places where actors can play and musicians can be heard, where paintings can be seen, poetry can be read and people can come to meet and talk and have coffee as well as be an audience, and where they can find familiar things as well as what may be unfamiliar new riches.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
During the last few months, I have talked to many of the men and women who are deeply involved in the theatre and in music in Scotland. I find a very wide agreement among them that to the extent that there is a barrier between the arts and the people, it is a barrier of unfamiliarity and inhibition rather than any kind of disenchantment. After all, there is a wide gap—we should recognise this—between those who have grown up in a home which took for granted the fact that it would have Brahms on its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
record player, that the children would be taken to the theatre or the ballet as a holiday treat or to visit the galleries and museums for fun, and those whose first experience of many of these joys comes at school. For the latter, there is a perfectly natural hesitation in going to concerts, to plays, ballet or opera which the world of the arts must recognise and, I think, does recognise.<br><br>
What we have to consider is how best we can attract and encourage those for whom these things are a little unfamiliar to come into the world of the arts. There are ways which may be tried. Folk music, good jazz, the young generation of poets, and theatre such as Brecht, Pinter and Wesker may well be far more attractive to the new generation than the traditional drawing-room comedy and bedroom farce which has been the habitual enjoyment of a generation which has grown up knowing the theatre.<br><br>
What seems to me to matter above all is that whatever is offered should be the best of its kind, with no concession to lower standards. The young seem to have a natural flair for discrimination between the first-rate and anything less than first-rate. There is certainly no concession of any kind in seeking to provide what is best of its kind and likely to be enjoyed.<br><br>
The second possibility to be fostered is the encouragement of visits to performances by parties from outlying towns and villages. The Arts Council can make special arrangements for cheaper tickets and travel—for example, visits organised by trade unions, factories, clubs and organisations of all kinds. The third possibility is to take the arts to people by organising tours of companies and artists, perhaps to the point where we have almost a mobile arts centre going to a town or a village for an evening or two of music, theatre or painting, everything which can normally be found only in the city.<br><br>
I am glad that the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council has taken up suggestions of mine on these lines, and I hope that we shall see practical results within the next year. They follow up, of course, the White Paper's suggestion that:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"the use of mobile Arts centres or of travelling theatres, even of temporary theatres, are all possibilities which might be investigated."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) asked me what help we might be able to give, or what help local authorities could find, in drawing up schemes which might qualify for assistance from the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council in housing the arts. The officials of the Arts Council in Scotland will be able to give advice to the promoters of schemes such as these, both on the best way to promote them and on the technical details.<br><br>
I am very anxious that the expertise which they build up should be available to those who, although perhaps not concerned with creating full centres for the arts, are, nevertheless, about to build community centres or youth wings of community centres, which may include facilities for the performance or practice of the arts. It would be a great pity, when that kind of scheme is coming forward, if the details of it were not such as made it possible for it to be used for a number of other purposes in the arts. I am, therefore, seeing that schemes of this kind which come to the notice of the Department are referred, where appropriate, to the Arts Council so that expert advice on these aspects can be made available to the promoters.<br><br>
Both the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council and the Scottish Education Department are willing and anxious to help any local authority which wants to spend just a little more money on housing the arts and would like help and advice on the best way of doing this. We are always available, as I am myself, for anyone who seeks this kind of help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. Lady to answer one point, as she seems now to be moving away from local authorities. She mentioned the fact that the estimate of local authority contributions is one penny. While I agree absolutely that this is low, far below the potential, would she not agree that the local authorities are spending a great deal more in Scotland than the Arts Council itself and, therefore, they deserve a great tribute for this? Also, their record, even at one penny, is considerably better than the local authorities in England and Wales.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly a little better than the local authorities, so far as the survey discovered it, in England and Wales and the circular which we issued paid a great deal of tribute to what the local authorities are doing. I am taking the opportunity to emphasise to the local authorities that, in so far as the Government have made money available for the housing of the arts, the initiative will have to come from the local authorities in Scotland, if Scotland is to get its share of this. We as a Government cannot ensure that Scotland gets its share unless local authorities come forward with proposals which would be eligible for money from the Arts Council. This in no way detracts from what local authorities have done and are doing, but just asks them to look at the possibility of preparing schemes which will let us have some of this money in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a point of some importance in Scotland, as many people worry about it. The hon. Lady says that there is nothing the Government can do if the local authorities do not come forward fast enough. In both building and the contribution which the Government give to the arts there has been a considerable amount of feeling in Scotland that much of what is available is given to the central areas, that London and the big cities get more than their fair share. The hon. Lady says that the Government can do nothing about this. If they wanted to, the Government could allocate a specific amount of the total of the Arts Council money for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) is confusing two things. There is, on the one hand, the money which the Arts Council, through its committees, makes available to assist orchestras, theatres and so on. Of this, it is true that London tends to get a disproportionate amount, because it is regarded as having centres like Covent Garden. Scotland gets a large share, however, of the money which is distributed around the country outside London, which the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council gives to the various artistic ventures in Scotland which need help.<br><br>
That is one side of the picture. The new money which is now available for the first time this year—a quarter of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
a million pounds—is specifically for housing the arts. This is to take place by the building of premises by local authorities in their own areas. The Government could not do this unless they were to go into an area and thrust aside the local authority and say, "We shall build your hall and theatre in this town." Obviously, we cannot do this. In using a fair share of the quarter of a million pounds now available for housing the arts, the Government must rely on local authorities to produce their requests for money. The only alternative would be to intervene far too strongly with the rights of local authorities in their own areas, which no one would wish us to do. That is a separate issue from the support given to companies, theatres and so on in Scotland.<br><br>
The Arts Council in Scotland is going through a change at the moment. We are all encouraged by the imaginative appointment of the Arts Council of Ronald Mavor as its Scottish Director in succession to Dr. George Firth. As the son of James Bridie, whose influence has been so powerful in shaping the postwar upsurge in the arts in Scotland, and as someone who has himself had quite an influence already, Mr. Mavor can be counted upon to stimulate and encourage the best of the new. I should like, too, to pay tribute to the work of Dr. Firth as the director over the last 17 years. To him, everyone interested in the arts in Scotland owes a great debt. The growing success of major enterprises like the Orchestra, the Edinburgh Festival, the repertory theatres and Scottish Opera and the equally important spread of directly provided concerts throughout Scotland, which I have already mentioned, are very largely due to his zeal and wisdom over the years.<br><br>
On repertory theatres, we welcome the continuing success of those in Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. It is good to see the Glasgow Citizens' flourishing, with a reputation growing every year, as one of the most important repertory theatres in Britain. The new Edinburgh Civic Theatre, with Tom Fleming directing it, and the Traverse Theatre, with all the excitement of its "off-Broadway" productions, make it certain that Edinburgh and the east of Scotland will have good theatre to offer all the year round. All these theatres are, of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
course, assisted by the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council.<br><br>
Scottish Opera has had tremendous and spectacular success over the years since 1962. It is an excellent example of the kind of co-operation which the Government would welcome since the local authorities of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh joined with the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council, several charitable trusts and the Musicians' Union, to launch a very successful season of opera, widely held to be the best ever given by Scottish Opera. The figures are quite spectacular and show the increase</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my lion. Friend say what contribution the Arts Council makes to the Scottish Opera?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The contribution is going up from £9,000 to £15,000 to Scottish Opera.<br><br>
There are museums and galleries, about which perhaps some of my hon. Friends would like to speak. The important thing again is to encourage participation by people by making museums and galeries attractive by offering opportunities to have coffee and to learn about what is going on in the museums. Opening hours are something which should be looked at. There are many things in connection with museums and galleries on which a great deal is being done and can be done to encourage greater participation by the public in all the opportunities which the museums can offer. I do not, at this stage, refer—as I might be expected to do—to the point raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes). I will do that when I wind up.<br><br>
We are on the threshold of what can be most exciting advances in the arts in Scotland. In a number of new directions, new opportunities are being offered. In a number of new directions, new opportunities are being taken. There are new men and women in the arts in Scotland who are eager and ready to make the most which can be made of the opportunities which are coming the way of Scotland. I believe that if we can have a widespread anxiety on the part of local authorities, the Government and all those bodies which have a direct interest in the arts in Scotland, we can be sure that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Scotland will be able to use very fully indeed the opportunities which the Government are now providing for them—only a starting point at this stage, but ready to be built up over the years, so that Scotland can be proud of the provision which it makes available for its people, in whatever part of Scotland they may live, to participate in, to enjoy and to relish all that the arts can offer them.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the party opposite for the choice of this subject today and also to thank the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland for her interesting review of her own and the Government's views on how art can be helped in Scotland and the proposals she has for doing so. Inevitably she has had to select certain parts of the problem to discuss, and inevitably I shall have to select. Many of the things which I have to say coincide with what the hon. Lady said, and others are matters which perhaps she can touch upon when she winds up the debate.<br><br>
I should like to refer back to the hon. Lady's remarks about the desirability of encouraging the arts in Scotland. A phrase which she used was that she was sure that this would give a good return in terms of human happiness and enjoyment. I fully agree with that sentiment, but I ask her and the Government if they could not look a little further and agree with me that not only is this a question of giving enjoyment, pleasure and satisfaction to those of us who live in Scotland but it is also a matter of vital importance in establishing Scotland generally as a country desirable to live in and to come to.<br><br>
I have been absolutely amazed in the past few years to find how difficult it has been to attract people to come and live in Scotland. Those who have been engaged in trying to attract businesses will have found, as I, and, I am sure, my hon. and right hon. Friends, have found, that so often we find people living in England who regard Scotland as an intellectual waste. They think it a marvellous country with beautiful scenery but they are reluctant to leave what they regard as the bright lights of England.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0379">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
I have lived all my life in Scotland and I have never experienced any feeling of that kind there. Indeed, having lived partly in London during the past nine months my desire to live in Scotland is, if anything, stronger than it was before. I have no doubt whatever that anyone who lives outside Scotland should not hesitate for one moment to come to Scotland. This business of the arts has not only cultural importance but real value in terms of money to Scotland, and if we can convince people of the fact that Scotland is well provided in the arts and intends to be better provided I shall be surprised if our difficulties in attracting them to Scotland will not become a great deal less.<br><br>
A recent difficulty was to persuade employees of the Savings Bank to come to Glasgow. Their reluctance can be well understood in terms of uprooting their homes and things of that kind, but if we in Scotland had made the most of what we have and had made clear in the past how much we had to offer in both scenery and culture the task would have been easier. I do not mind betting that in years to come those same people will be most reluctant to leave Scotland.<br><br>
Our aims in the arts should be twofold. Firstly, we must be prepared to make available the money to ensure that we in Scotland can provide the best in professional art, and I speak of art in its widest possible field. Secondly, and allied to it as an absolutely essential factor, we must provide sufficient for the amateur participant in the arts to practise his form of enjoyment in the best possible way. It is a great mistake to regard this as something separate. We shall never get full concert halls and theatres and a real appreciation of the arts unless we have given instruction and enabled people even in the remoter areas to learn the musical instruments, to take part in amateur dramatics and to see good art displayed, even if it is only now and then. It is essential to regard these two things as two parts making a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not expect the hon. Member to give any figures but has he any idea in his mind of what money would be needed to achieve these results?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to the figures later. They will fit in better in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
the context of my speech. I am grateful to the hon. Member for the suggestion that this obviously will cost a lot of money. I intend to put it in perspective later on.<br><br>
I should like to speak briefly about amenities. It is difficult to draw the line between amenities and the arts, and it is possible that one or two of the items which I should like to mention do not come strictly within the hon. Lady's responsibility but come rather within the responsibility of her colleague as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Greenock (Dr. Dickson Mabon). I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me if that is so, and perhaps she will take the opportunity of having a word with the hon. Member about this.<br><br>
It all ties up with making Scotland attractive. I would refer first to the clearing up of derelict sites, ill-looking buildings and ruins which litter quite a bit of the surface of Scotland. We have had Government grants to help the clearing of bings for some years, and great strides have been made. Probably all of us will be able to recall many of these things which have been improved. I ask the hon. Lady if she would consider producing a book such as that produced by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in England, known as "New Life for Dead Lands" which shows very graphically what has been done in making derelict sites look attractive. It would be interesting if we could have something from the Scottish Office to show what has been done in that field and to encourage others to do more.<br><br>
The second matter to which I want to refer is based on remarks made recently by the Secretary of State for Scotland, who said that he was anxious about the standard of design of our housing. In this I thoroughly support and agree with him. It is vitally important—and I do not know to what extent the Government can influence it—that we should try to get a better standard of design, and especially exterior design, in our house building. Many of our towns have row upon row of drab grey houses all identical in design and with exactly the same colour of roof. No doubt they are extremely good houses inside but their outside appearance requires more attention than it has been given in the past.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
This is very largely not a question of money, and I would cite an example of what has been done completely cheaply. I hope that the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) will not mind my referring to no less a street than Woodburn Crescent in Alloa which is a very good example of what can be done with an ordinary street of ordinary council houses all of which have different coloured tiled roofs. I do not believe that the different coloured roofs cost a penny more but the difference in the appearance of the houses is quite outstanding. This is an excellent example of what can be done.<br><br>
Lastly under this heading is the question of our historic sites or battlefields. Those who visit the battlefield of Culloden near Inverness can see what can be done, in this instance by the National Trust, to make a place previously only recorded as a battlefield into what is now a place of great interest to visit. One can really feel what went on on that dreadful day of the battle. As a result, the number of visitors has greatly increased, and the site is one of the greatest attractions for visitors now controlled by the National Trust.<br><br>
This brings me to the question of historic buildings. I do not know whether this comes under the hon. Lady's responsibility, but I sound my first note of concern this morning. I find that not only many members of the public but also many hon. Members feel that because there is a system whereby a building of historic interest is or can be scheduled by the Secretary of State there is, therefore, no cause for concern and we can all go about our daily life secure in the knowledge that no building of historic merit can be decaying or can be destroyed. It is a most alarming fact that this is not so, and I urge the Government to look carefully at the current state of the law in the matter of preserving historic buildings in Scotland. No doubt the same applies in England.<br><br>
First, our historic buildings are a vital part of our national heritage. They are not a luxury. They are simply something which we cannot afford to let fall into decay—and to a large extent these buildings are falling into decay invisibly today.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
What happens is that the Secretary of State is empowered to schedule those buildings which are considered of sufficient importance. But what does this amount to? It amounts to their being put on a provisional list. Efforts are being made to make this list final. A large part of the list, however, is still provisional, and while it is provisional—and this may surprise hon. Members—the owner of the scheduled property does not necessarily know that it is scheduled.<br><br>
I had a case drawn to my attention a few days ago of a site where there were two or three different items of great architectural interest. Two had been pulled down and one had been transferred to a different site. When this was noticed, the owners, a company, were approached and asked why they had done it. They had no record of the fact that these items were scheduled. The Department confirmed that they did not necessarily have to have such a record and would not know probably until such time as a provisional list was made final. It is vitally important that the provisional parts of these lists, which amount to the majority of them, should be made final as quickly as possible. We need a crash programme to do this. It is most important that all owners should know whether their property is scheduled so that they know that they are breaking the regulations if they remove the property or take it down.<br><br>
This, however, is only part of the story. Let us suppose that there is a building which the owner knows is scheduled. He sells to somebody else—and I can cite many examples of this. It might be a property-owner and it might be someone who is not interested in the building as a historic building but interested only in the site as a whole or the land round about it. Unless the former owner or some local interested party or the local authority notices this it is possible for the historic building to be allowed to lie empty or to fall into decay, and, to a surprising extent, even stripped of some of its interior items of interest and value. No one would do this deliberately, and, of course, it is not possible to knock the building down without its being noticed, but once a building has gone beyond a certain point it is .a question not of knocking down but of spending thousands of pounds to prevent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
its falling down. There are many buildings of this kind throughout Scotland.<br><br>
If someone notices the possibility of a house being sold and falling into the hands of somebody who is not interested in its historic merit and he wants to save it, one would think that that would be all right, but it is not as simple as that because there is nobody who has any money to do anything about it. If one notices this and wants to do something one will find that the National Trust is most interested and helpful but it will not have any money to put into the preservation of the building. The Historic Buildings Council for Scotland, of which the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire is a member, will be very helpful, but it has very limited power to do anything and it is possible that it would not be able to help. One is left with a situation where there is a building of historic interest which the owner cannot or will not keep up and no one else will keep up and the building will undoubtedly fall down in time through neglect. There are cases of this kind all over Scotland today, and most of them are not known about or noticed.<br><br>
The law and regulations in this matter must be reconsidered. I suggest two things to be done straight away. The present provisional lists of historic building should be confirmed and made permanent and definite, and the owners should be informed. Second, a more positive watch should be kept by, I suggest, a body of experts, based, perhaps, on the Historic Buildings Council, so that historic buildings in Scotland can be kept under a constant eye. It is not good enough to leave it to the local planning authorities, which have many other matters to concern them. It must be done by people with historical and achitectural knowledge and a positive interest in watching over anything which is likely to fall into decay.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I return now to the arts, the main theme of the hon. Lady's speech. I was glad to hear her start by defining her own responsibility and that of the hon. Lady the Member for Cannock (Miss Jennie Lee), though I confess that it was a little difficult to be sure exactly what the position was at the end of her explanation, not through any fault of hers but because the matter is, perhaps, a little
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
complicated. As I understood it—the hon. Lady will correct me if I am wrong—as the hon. Lady the Member for Cannock is Joint Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Education and Science in England, the exactly equivalent responsibility in Scotland falls to the Scottish Department of Education. Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not quite. The Prime Minister has charged my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Miss Jennie Lee) with special responsibility for developing overall policy for the arts, so that in overall policy, which is a matter for Government decision and not for any one Department's decision, she has much more responsibility than I have. But in terms of the implemention of the policy, she does it for England and Wales and I do it for Scotland. Perhaps that makes it clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I thank the hon. Lady for trying to make the matter somewhat clearer. I think that that is all right, provided that the hon. Lady the Member for Cannock can divide herself between her overall responsibility and what I might call her departmental responsibility in which, so to speak, she represents the hon. Lady the Member for Lanark (Mrs. Hart) in England. It is most important that we know exactly who is responsible. I think we can take it that in most matters it will be the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who will be concerned, and only in matters of overall responsibility affecting the United Kingdom as a whole will the hon. Lady the Member for Cannock be in control. I think that that makes it a little clearer. We should give it a chance to work. It is certainly a good thing to have people directly interested in promoting the arts, and we must give the new system a trial.<br><br>
The question of providing money was referred to both by the hon. Lady and her hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). I shall not dwell too long on this. Under all Governments, at all times, it will be difficult to secure the money we want to support the arts because there are so many vital demands and national purposes on which money has to be spent. Any criticism or demands for more money for the arts which I make now would be made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0382">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
equally strongly and equally fervently were my own party on the Government side. This is a battle which all those who understand the value of the arts must fight all the time. In the nature of things, we shall never be able to obtain all the resources necessary but we must keep on demanding them because the subject is so important.<br><br>
The present expenditure by the Arts Council in Scotland, according to my calculations, amounts to only 5.6 per cent. of the whole. This is very much below the ratio of population between Scotland and the country as a whole, and it is also well below the Goschen formula under which Scotland should receive eleven-eightieths of expenditure as a whole. We cannot be satisfied with this figure. We must pursue Governments of all complexions until we have in Scotland at least our proportionate entitlement. This is all the more necessary because, Scotland being a Province, we are at the far end of anything which comes from London. We must, therefore, insist on getting at least our full share. There was also the very good comparison touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) in his intervention, that, although the Arts Council is this year to have an increase up to £250,000, a 1d. rate throughout Scotland would produce £427,000. This puts in perspective the amount which we are spending. It certainly does not satisfy me. Although I congratulate anyone who manages to get more money for the arts, I feel that to be spending less than the product of a 1d. rate from central Government funds, in spite of the good efforts of the local authorities, is no cause for satisfaction.<br><br>
I turn now to one or two branches of the arts which are of particular importance and which have shown interesting results in the past two years. First, art galleries and museums generally. The problem here is one of accommodation. In almost every case and in almost every part of the country—Glasgow, Edinburgh or anyhere else—the whole problem centres on accommodation, and the question of acquisition is really secondary. Acquisition is difficult, of course, because it requires new money, and the cost of acquiring works of art
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
goes up and up. Accommodation, however, is something about which we really could do more.<br><br>
I assume that the provision in the White Paper for building, £250,000 for the whole United Kingdom, is supposed to cover accommodation for artistic exhibitions generally, for paintings and so on, as well as for concert halls. Although it is a good effort to produce a scheme of some sort, I hope that no one will think that £250,000 is anything more than the most microscopic and tentative of starts. We must think of very much larger sums of money than that if we are to have any results.<br><br>
Accommodation for art galleries is more difficult because extremely expensive and difficult to justify in itself. But, provided that the arts centre idea can be developed to include some accommodation for the display of works of art, we shall make progress in the right direction, and this would be something within our means and power to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that a very much larger sum of money was needed, as much as £1 million. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do, and I shall not be put off in the slighest by the suggestion that we cannot in any circumstances find a sum amounting to more than £1 million for developing accommodation for the arts in the country as a whole. It would be spent over several year. Of course, we can easily shrug it off if we want to. Let there be no mistake about that. We can survive without it, but we shall do so at our peril, and Governments of any complexion must be prepared to provide money for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that he will allow me to point out what is actually said in the relevant paragraph in the White Paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"As a first step, the Arts Council will be authorised to enter into commitments up to £250,000 in 1965–66"—</p></blockquote>
that is, for housing the arts—
<br><blockquote><p>"If this has the desired effect"—</p></blockquote>
that is, in encouraging regional and local effort—
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government will be ready, when the time comes, to consider authorising the Arts

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Council to enter into substantially higher levels of commitment in future years."</p></blockquote>
I think that the hon. Gentleman would be less than fair if he did not say that this was clearly intended as a first step in an expansion which we hope will go on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady will not think me churlish. I am not trying to be ungrateful. I have said that it is a good effort to start the idea at all, and I give all credit for it. The only point is that none of us should pretend—I am sure that the hon. Lady does not—that it is more than the very tiniest start.<br><br>
I turn now to three small suggestions regarding art galleries and displays. I regard it as a very good idea to have exhibitions travelling round more. I shall say no more about this. The question is being looked into, and I suppose that that is as much as we can ask at the moment. Second, we should encourage those responsible to produce simpler catalogues. Going round art galleries, one finds that a great deal of cross-reference is necessary to find one's way round even the simplest catalogue. There is scope for more simple cataloguing.<br><br>
Third, hours of opening. When I visited an art gallery recently—it shall remain nameless—I was horrified at the way people were turned out within five minutes of closing time. It closed at five o'clock, and I was there at five minutes to five. People were shoved out between five minutes to five and five o'clock in a way which made me feel ashamed, not for myself but for the many foreign visitors who were there. Arrangements ought to be made by those running art galleries to stop people coming in early enough so that they are not literally shepherded out in the last five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be an infinitely better solution not to close so early? The whole point is that working people in general cannot visit exhibitions until the evening. Why not close at ten o'clock?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, but that is a slightly different point. I am merely suggesting that arrangements should be made so that people can come in and see the exhibition and be ushered gently out. It should not be difficult.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
I shall not discuss drama because it has been touched on by the hon. Lady, and I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West hopes to mention the matter in more detail later. I conclude with a few observations about music, on which we have had a real success story to tell in Scotland over the past few years. Few who have heard the Scottish National Orchestra in recent years will deny that it has gone from strength to strength. A great deal of the credit for this must go to the present conductor, Mr. Alexander Gibson, who is a Scotsman and who is doing quite remarkable work. The orchestra he now directs is able to hold its own against any other, and this in itself has been a tremendous morale booster for the people of Scotland, particularly for those interested in music.<br><br>
This has been shown in no way better than in the success of Scottish Opera. Scottish Opera is a really exciting development, a triumph of co-operation among everyone concerned, local authorities and locally interested people, the music authorities, the Musicians' Union and many others, all determined that what was produced by Scottish Opera should be the best of its kind. Perhaps the most satisfactory feature of all has been the number of Scottish people able to take part in Scottish Opera without there being any suggestion of the lowering of standards. Some extremely fine artistes of Scottish origin working in London and other centres have come back to Scotland to make a success of Scottish Opera. When I first went to Scottish Opera, I was tremendously excited by its success and its high standard. It is an example of what we can do in many other fields, and I hope that no one will flag in support of it. I hope that its current success this year in Aberdeen will encourage everyone to go even further in the years to come.<br><br>
I turn now to the amateur side of the arts, the amateur performer and amateur participant. All we say about support for the arts in general and the high standards we achieve and hope to achieve will fall on stony ground unless there are, in all parts of the country and in all walks of life, people who have practical experience of the arts, people who appreciate them and, because they know about them by practical participation, can appreciate them all the more.<br><br>

It is particularly appropriate for the hon. Lady, in view of her other responsibilities, to realise that there is here a way to maintain and develop a link between education and our cultural life. This should be all the more welcomed—I am sure that it will be—not only by the vast majority of the people but by the teaching profession in particular because it presents an excellent way of attracting people back to teaching. Teachers can feel that not only will they have the privilege and excitement of teaching young people throughout their school career but they will have the responsibility of instructing older people right through their lives in matters of interest, artistic, technical and the rest.<br><br>
I have been rather sad in recent years to see how few people realise how much they can learn and can do in further education classes. I refer particularly to music. The standard of music teachers in our best secondary schools is very high. They are people of excellent qualifications who can hold their own anywhere in the world. It is a great attraction if they can have another interest apart from teaching in school, perhaps a choral society or an amateur orchestra, and really connect the educational establishment with the community.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
In many places in Scotland where there are insufficient premises and accommodation for holding concerts and the like, more and more often now there are magnificent new schools with magnificent halls, and I would hope that we could do more in the future to encourage education authorities to allow and encourage actively the use of their school halls by the communities round about, not only because it is a good idea but because they are so well equipped. Very often there is the equipment that the hon. Lady referred to for dramatics and space for a full symphony orchestra. On some occasions, although it is rather rare, there is even accommodation in school halls for a full choir and a full orchestra. In a small community where there is no hall but where a school is being built, I hope that the Scottish Education Department will be prepared to co-operate with the local authority to make an all-purpose hall to serve both the school and the community. There is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
great scope here for joining up the educational side and the cultural side, particularly in remote areas.<br><br>
I hope I have made it clear that in my view this is not a question purely of pleasure and convenience and something that we would like to do if we could. Support for the arts, both professional and amateur, must be given in Scoiland if we are to make Scotland the centre of a new feeling and spirit, not only industrially but culturally. It will make a very big contribution to the Scotland of the future that we all want to see.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not too sure where to start my contribution, because it would be very tempting to follow the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) into some of his battlefields. We should be grateful that in his speech, unlike some speakers from his side, he did not suggest that we should keep politics out of it, meaning that we should not examine the failures and shortcomings of the previous Administration in their lukewarm support for the arts, particularly in Scotland. I think that is a fair point to make.<br><br>
I reckon that I have three qualifications for taking part in this debate. I am a direct descendant of Neil Gower, the Scottish composer and violinist. I had a grandfather who was a poet. Some of my friends think that this artistic talent escaped my generation, but I am also a member of the Art Galleries Committee in Glasgow, and I worked for a couple of years in the Citizens' Theatre, albeit backstage in an administrative capacity.<br><br>
To be quite honest, the real reason for my taking part in the debate is that I was unfortunate enough to get involved in debates on local government and education. It is typical of so many of us in the field of the arts when something is regarded as a second or third base that, having made some acquaintance with it, one becomes interested in it and stimulated by the experience of being associated with such a fascinating subject.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend has said, we welcomed this debate. Already, as in so many other fields, the Government are ahead even of the people, and in this one it is particularly noticeable. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0385">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
have had a White Paper, with all the exciting prospects of the grant of more money. We have had a debate in the House itself, and now we have this debate.<br><br>
I feel sorry for hon. Members opposite, because I am not too sure how they approach the subject. If there is one subject where there has been a complete failure on the part of private enterprise and commercialism in the country, it is the arts. I wonder how they square their approach today with the provocative speech of the right hon. and learned Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Hogg) at the weekend—I almost said "the saint from Marylebone"—when he talked about our ability to over-spend in the public sector, because here is one subject which is being discussed completely divorced from the idea that private enterprise or commercial interests have any contribution in the field of the arts other than by the notable exception of those that have been made to the Scottish National Orchestra and in other small fields by certain industrial concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did someone say "Rubbish"? You will have your chance to disprove it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Unfortunately I have no opportunity to make speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. The hon. Member opposite can disprove it if he cares to.<br><br>
It is significant that even in the new towns or the big new housing estates in Glasgow and other cities, not one local authority can attract even a cinema into them, never mind anything else; and the cinema is not always very artistic these days.<br><br>
I want to try to be constructive, and I start off by referring to the Annual Report of the Arts Council where, on page 51, referring to Glasgow, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"With its famous Citizens' Theatre Company, its great art collection and its enlarged Scottish National Orchestra, all suitably housed, Glasgow bids fair to become one of the leading world centres of the arts."</p></blockquote>
Quite frankly, I do not think that is unduly optimistic, and it is with those sentiments in mind that I am appealing to my hon. Friend to see what she can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
do to make that a realisation as quickly as possible. I still have the somewhat naive belief that the Secretary of State in Scotland is all-powerful. We should be prepared not just to wait on local authorities or other bodies to initiate schemes, but sometimes, with a bit of prodding and encouragement behind the scenes, should encourage initiative to be taken.<br><br>
It is generally accepted that the Arts Council in Scotland has done an excellent job within the framework of its structure and the money available. Nevertheless, there is a tendency even in the Citizens' Theatre to be reluctant to ask for more money. It is a strange thing, but I find that many people are genuinely concerned at having to ask for public money to provide this kind of worthwhile service to the community. I have the feeling that, with a bit of encouragement from my hon. Friend, the establishment of real repertory in the Citizens' Theatre could become a reality, and it is just the reluctance to ask for more money that has held it back until now.<br><br>
On the question of publicising the subsidy arrangements which my hon. Friend mentioned, this again is something which could be looked at by the Arts Council in Scotland. Again, I am not complaining about its willingness to give money, but there is a reluctance to accept that there cannot be arts for the masses without some form of subsidy. It is one form of subsidy about which I never hear hon. Members Opposite complaining. In Scotland, where the arts are enjoyed in the main by people who can afford to pay the full price, there is a greater subsidy in proportion to what is given than in any other field of public expenditure. However, it is recognised that we are taking this out of the sphere of commercialism, so that it is important that we should make a success of publicising the subsidy scheme. I do not think there is anything comparable with going to a theatre or to a performance of the Scottish National Orchestra in appropriate surroundings. No matter what one does by make-shift performances in school halls and so on, they are makeshift performances and do not give the real excitement and atmosphere which is obtainable in a proper theatre or concert hall. We should aim at building up on the best foundations of what exists in the main centres—and in Scotland, so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
far as the arts are concerned, that means Glasgow—and I think we should look at it kindly in that regard.<br><br>
I am not altogether sure that visits to schools are always the best way of introducing the school population to the arts. Some of my hon. Friends will disagree with me, but I just say as a word of warning that we should not automatically assume that we are getting the maximum return if we take Shakespeare and music to schools. It is bringing them to the exciting place which is important, rather than giving them the true art or entertainment without the trimmings. It is a compromise that we have to make in the hope of interesting people in it.<br><br>
Another point that is worth looking at is a link-up between the B.B.C. and the Citizens' Theatre, with a view to not necessarily the joint use of studio accommodation but an exchange of ideas, props and everything connected with the dramatic side, and consulting with Equity. It seems to me that between what are the two principal employers of members of the profession it should be possible to enhance the desirability of not going south to London to seek fame and fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lest it is thought to be a little unrealistic to talk about a link-up between schools and the B.B.C., perhaps the hon. Member knows that in the Palaces of Pioneers in the Soviet Union, there is a link-up between Radio Moscow, with its considerable T.V. facilities, and schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member is saying is that there should be a link-up between the B.B.C. and schools. There is at the moment, and it could be strengthened. What I was saying is that there could be an opportunity for development of the employment of top actors.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I certainly agree with the hon. Member for Ayr that the Government have a responsibility for the better design of housing and for better design in Government buildings. There has been no striking improvement in the past 13 years in the standard and design of Government offices as distinct from housing developments. In a Committee like this, it is easy to suggest that this, that and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
the next thing can be done, but behind it all is always the question of cost.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr said that we are all interested and concerned in the importance of arts but that behind it all was the thought that we should spend the money because it would attract industry. There is always that approach behind it which suggests that it is not simply an appreciation of the subject for its own sake, but that there is a desire to do these things to make money out of them somewhere. I may be doing the hon. Member an injustice, but that is how his remarks appeared to me. In practical terms, in Government buildings and in housing design, there have not been the advances that the hon. Member suggested were desirable. Since his party had responsibility in the past, if they mean what they are saying today we should have seen greater evidence of it before.<br><br>
There are two points on which I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to consider what help can be given. I wonder whether she can take a special interest in the development of the Arts Centre in Glasgow, if that is its proper description. This is not an airy-fairy scheme. A decision has, in fact, been taken. This is probably the biggest breakthrough in Scotland for years. I know of my hon. Friend's personal interest, and I hope that, without infringing upon the rights and responsibilities of the local authority, she will follow this venture with interest and see what help she can give.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member is dealing with the Arts Centre for Glasgow and is so optimistic about Glasgow being a great centre, what can be done by the Glasgow Corporation to remove the slur of not properly housing the Burrell collection of pictures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. That is typical of the ill-informed opinion that too many people have about Glasgow, which, unfortunately, is encouraged by members of the party opposite. Even in Glasgow we cannot provide a music service or a gramophone record lending service because of the opposition of friends of hon. Members opposite. Yearly, there is opposition from them in Glasgow, even to the contribution which is made to the Scottish National Orchestra. Hon. Members opposite
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
should not make cheap propaganda points to suggest that Labour supporters and the local authority are unwilling to accept responsibility to provide for the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But they are in the majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know. It is easy to make that sort of point. As to the Burrell collection, at last the matter is with the Government. I appeal to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to try to speed up the negotiations or the application which is now in the hands of the Treasury.<br><br>
This is a most interesting subject. None of us can cover it adequately in a 10 or 15-minute speech, and if I have taken longer I apologise. We should not discuss it in abstract terms. I cannot see how we shall ever get a wider appreciation of things that are good in life unless we are prepared to attack the commercialism and the exploitation of the young in "pop" and all that is today associated with teenagers. Therefore, while it is impossible to go into that, I think that the young people are responding well to the exciting developments which have taken place in the Scottish Orchestra and the Citizens' Theatre. Given the backing of a Government who believe in these things, I see no reason to be despondent about the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the next speaker, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that a large number of hon. Members are anxious to speak in this important debate. We are now past the halfway stage and we have had only three speakers so far. I appeal to hon. Members to cut their remarks and make them as concise as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour, Mr. Steele, to carry on at the double, and as I intended to talk about physical recreation, that is, perhaps, reasonably appropriate. First, I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) for his fine speech from the Front Bench. As he represents an area the combination of cultural and physical beauty of which is, possibly, second only to that of Dumfries, I am glad to be able to support him. I should like also warmly to praise the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary for her constructive approach to the debate and the much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
interesting information which she has given.<br><br>
I should like, first, to say a few words concerning the museums and the art galleries, because they are the centrepiece of Scotland's collections, mainly in Edinburgh, although I shall have a word to say also about Glasgow. We all appreciate that there is a serious lack of space in the museums and galleries in Edinburgh. That is why I am glad to hear that the building fund is being increased and that action will be taken.<br><br>
We have to accept that of all the gifts and purchases that have been accumulated by the Scottish galleries and museums, only about one-third are on display at any one time. It is extremely important that we should increase this ratio as soon as possible to at least one-half. I am not one who looks upon this with a particularly parochial eye. I am not desperately worried whether the treasure found at St. Ninian's Isle is on display in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Lerwick or in Galloway as long as it is on display somewhere. That is the important thing.<br><br>
In the same way, I am not one who says that the Elgin Marbles must be returned to Greece at once, because if Scottish art treasures are on display somewhere, the people who want to see them will go to look at them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such as the peasants of Greece?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The importance to Scotland of a national exhibition hall cannot be overstated. As our capital is Edinburgh, I feel that that is where it should be sited. Where we have exhibitions brought together at, say, the Edinburgh Festival, the National Gallery has to un-mount its existing displays to mount new ones. If we had an exhibition hall, they could be complementary and would not have to be chopped and changed to the extent that they are.<br><br>
We have in the Portrait Gallery a first-class display of Scottish works of art. Perhaps it could do with far more publicity than it gets. Here, however, we have overcrowding, too. I understand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
that the Museum of Antiquities, which shares the Queen Street site, is one day—I hope, not too far ahead—to be moved into Chambers Street. Then the Portrait Gallery will be able to expand. That is something that we want to see, because the Scottish artists are becoming more and more popular with Scots people and the greater publicity that we can give them, the better. The more visitors we can bring to Scotland to see Scottish works of art, the better.<br><br>
I think that our policy on purchasing new works of art has been right. The National Gallery has tended to save up for a few years and then to buy big and to buy an important work. That is the right policy, but it needs the good will of the Treasury. So far, this has been forthcoming, and this is the way we want to keep it. It is far better to do this than to tie up with the London museums and galleries. We want to stand on our own feet and rely on the pressure of the Scottish Office on the Treasury to get the grants we need.<br><br>
I should like to see an opportunity for our provincial museums and galleries to accept more pictures and works of art on loan. This must be tied up with the question of security. If we can obtain sufficient security, Edinburgh should tend to lend works of art more frequently than it does. We want quick, short and sharp exhibitions. If we have specific exhibitions for two or three weeks, people come in at once because they have only the one opportunity, but if they are spread out over several months they drag and lose the local impact.<br><br>
I am trying to be brief to help other hon. Members to have an opportunity to speak, but I should like to say a word about the Historic Buildings Council. This body is doing fine work. I have one point which might be considered concerning the maintenance of fine pictures or works of art. Works of art are accepted sometimes in lieu of payment of death duties when an owner dies, but it would be well worth consideration whether those works of art should be eligible for maintenance grants during the lifetime of the owner so that they do not deteriorate, instead of, as at present, no action being taken until after the owner's death.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Before passing from the art galleries, I wish to refer to Glasgow, I was interested in what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) said. We tend to focus on Edinburgh as our capital. I add my appreciation, however, of the Glasgow galleries and, of course, the Mitchell Library. It is, however, wrong of the hon. Member to shilly-shally over the problem of the Burrell Collection, which for many years has concerned those of us who are interested in art. The sooner that it can be mounted in its new home, the better.<br><br>
The title of this debate includes the word "amenities", to which I wish to refer. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary is now responsible for art and amenities, because she is responsible also for education and the two subjects are in many ways tied in together. Although we cannot this morning go into long-term detail, we must have the right environment for amenity and recreation. Areas of high landscape value must be carefully worked out and implemented.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr referred also to architecture and to the standard of planning and facilities. In particular, there is a tendency to underestimate the value of many of the parks departments of local authorities. The ratepayers should always bear in mind that as many people appreciate the value of fine parks as deprecate them. We should not in any way try to reduce the facilities for recreation which are provided by our local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member, therefore, be prepared to advise his local authority, at the time of municipal elections, to take the line which he is now advocating?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of the enlightened local authorities in my part of the world spend a great deal of money on their parks and amenities.<br><br>
Recreation is an interest which I have very much at heart. We have always been rather shamefaced, perhaps, about leisure, and a hit frightened of enjoying it. Now that we have a shorter working week and transport facilities are so much better, people want to get out and do things, and this is most desirable. I pay tribute to the various sports bodies and associations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
and to the local authorities, and particularly the education authorities, the Scottish Council for Physical Recreation, the National Playing Fields Association and the youth clubs and youth leaders, who have done so much to improve these facilities. As more and more people want them, however, and as the population increases, the facilities seem to be all the more restricted. Thas is why we must take action now.<br><br>
I should like to pass on a word or two to the Scottish Education Department, which in the provision of playing fields seems to overlook the very high rainfall in Scotland. In some local areas, we often have 40 or 50 in. of rain a year, though that might be a dry year in parts of Argyllshire, for example. Generally speaking, that figure is not far from the average. It is simply not possible to play games like football, rugby and hockey on pitches which have a high rainfall every day. We must look, in the near future, to a big extension in the provision of all-whether playing fields, something similar to a hard tennis court, where games can be played all day and every day to the advantage of children. Hon. Members need not think that I am biased, because rugby is the only game which cannot be played on an all-weather playing field. This may be expensive, but it is worth while.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Secondly, we want to extend the facilities for indoor stadiums. I know that the Secretary of State has announced that there will be a £200,000 indoor sports centre in Glasgow, and I am looking forward to hearing more about it. I suppose that it will be similar to the Crystal Palace, but smaller. We want small halls for fencing, gym and boxing, and, as the hon. Lady said, for dramatic art. We want more facilities for swimming, because every child in Scotland ought to have the opportunity to learn to swim. As a last word about construction, I want to mention how valuable and local authorities have found it to develop rural schools which have closed into weekend youth centres. This is an admirable development and should be encouraged.<br><br>
Much of what I have said has been inspired by the Scottish Council for Physical Recreation. Most hon. Members have read its reports. I have attended its regional conference because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
I think that it does much which is valuable. I have had a look at Inverclyde, and I hope that it extends. The Government are giving about 50 per cent. of its income to the S.C.P.R., and I hope that they may find in future an opportunity of extending this.<br><br>
How else can the Government help? This is an important question, because we all say that more money is needed, but the important question is how is it to be provided? There are two ideas which I want to encourage. First is the consideration of rates. At the moment, local authorities have a discretionary right to give a 50 per cent. reduction in rates. I should like to see that made mandatory as soon as possible and if, in years to come, it could become a 100 per cent. right for amateur sports and cultural facilities, that would be a tremendous advantage. It would not cost local authorities very much when it is balanced against the money which they are paying into further education for young people.<br><br>
An idea which I throw out to the hon. Lady to pass on to her right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the complete abolition of Income Tax on amateur sports bodies, because it has a penal effect on them. If we allowed them to keep all their gate money and plough it back into the sport, so much the better. The principle must always be the same—that in amateur sport and recreation the Government must endeavour to help those who help themselves. I do not believe that they can throw out grants unless the bodies make the effort to raise much of the money themselves.<br><br>
There is now in Scotland a great momentum of interest in recreation and leisure, which has been helped by the Scottish Tourist Board and the S.C.P.R. It is attracting a great number of visitors from abroad and from England. We must maintain this impetus. We should not forget that recreation and amenity is for the young and the old. I want to see facilities for old people as well, to stop them being bored. This cannot be done by compulsion. Interest in the arts and recreation and leisure needs encouragement. The encouragement must come from all of us in Parliament today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to endorse your appeal to the Committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
Mr. Steele. In the old days, the members of the Scottish Grand Committee made a self-denying ordinance that speeches would not last longer than 15 minutes. That was carried on for many years until after the war. It might be worthwhile hon. Members reconsidering the idea of again having such a self-denying ordinance.<br><br>
I should like to congratulate my constituent, the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), on his splendid speech, not only because of the matter of the speech, but also because of its manner. I do not think that Parliament works best when it resolves itself into a slanging match, or that abuse contributes to progress, even in the House. Therefore, I congratulate him on a constructive speech. I was glad that he paid tribute to what has been done in the County of Clackmannan and elsewhere, because it is a remarkable illustration of what art is in the life of the people.<br><br>
The idea of art as something stuck on a canvas hanging on a wall inside an art gallery is the most fallacious and dangerous form of appreciation. I remember that when I became the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire it was difficult to go very far through my constituency without seeing ugly slagheaps, dirty buildings and very depressing sights. Today, it is like going through a garden city. Interspersed with the houses are beautifully laid-out gardens. If anyone tells me that that is not a finer kind of art than some of the contortions which appear on canvas, I shall be very surprised.<br><br>
I was very glad, therefore, that the hon. Member pointed out that art was something more than just sitting back and listening to pleasant sounds—or unpleasant sounds, in the opinion of some people—and that art can fill the life of the people. I believe that the purpose of art and amenities is to satisfy the finer attributes of human nature. Everyone has certain faculties. Some have a love of tunes, some of colour and some of energy. Our business as the Government is to give children, young people and old people the opportunity of fulfilling themselves in whichever direction their faculties take them.<br><br>
Therefore, this debate has begun to have such a wide range, straying even
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
into physical recreation. A beautiful body, physically trained, is a beautiful piece of art and all artists have delighted in painting it and in trying to re-create it, but surely the reality is better than any artificial re-creation. Young people swimming and bathing and struggling in a competitive effort to show that they are equal to the best of the Greek athletes is a form of art certainly equal to anything in an art gallery.<br><br>
The hon. Member referred to the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland of which I am a member, and the importance of preserving historic buildings. So far, all Governments have been willing to do this. The problem has been, as the hon. Member said, to spot the buildings, so that they are not lost. I was sorry that the Bill which dealt with the tourist traffic was withdrawn in the last Parliament, because there was a possibility of a council which would keep its eye on the existence of beauty in Scotland. It is desirable to have a body like the National Trust for historical buildings, whose business it would be to keep an eye on the past treasures of Scotland and see that nothing was done to destroy them.<br><br>
Fortunately, in addition to being interested in its Civil Service duties, the Scottish Office is also conscious of the need to preserve Scotland's beauties. The Ministry of Public Building and Works and its inspectors do a great job in finding out when anything is likely to be destroyed. Fortunately, many owners of historical buildings are given grants in order to preserve both pictures and buildings when this is necessary. This is very important, because Scotland would not look quite the same to anyone travelling through the country without these beautiful buildings, which were, perhaps, designed in an age of extravagance at the expense of poverty but have, nevertheless, remained, like Versailles Palace and many of the great buildings of France, as architectural monuments to the past.<br><br>
This is history written in stone, and people come from all over the world to see this history. Therefore, it is not only of academic interest but also provides an economic interest and is a valuable asset to Scotland's earnings from the tourist traffic. It is not a waste of money to preserve historic buildings. I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
profess to be able to see all the architectural beauty of all the buildings, but I can see that in many of these buildings there is something outstanding which ought to be preserved.<br><br>
Another form which this has taken has been encouraged by the National Trust. The facelift of villages and little towns in Scotland has made a remarkable difference to the art and amenities of the country. This applies to a place like Haddington, where the main street has had its facelift, or Dunkeld, where the National Trust has reconstituted the little houses. Anybody can experience a sense of joy and beauty from seeing these .little houses, which used to look like slums. The most astonishing change which has taken place in my experience was Lamb's House in Leith where the architect had the vision of what that house was originally, and what it could be restored to. It has been restored, and it is now used for old people's clubs, where wonderful work is done. The building itself is the only historical building in Leith and has been preserved by the imagination of an architect and the assistance of the National Trust and the Historic Buildings Council.<br><br>
A great deal is being done in this respect, and I am glad that this question has been raised today, as it might interest other hon. Members in this very important part of the Government's activity in preserving these buildings. My purpose in speaking was not so much to speak about the National Trust as to deal with a special subject which was also raised by the hon. Member for Ayr. It is that the basis of all this astral plane of art, the basis of all the talk and figures about art, must be a population which is interested in art and culture of all kinds. This, as the hon. Member said, must begin in the schools. In the schools, there is the great opportunity of taking a more comprehensive view of life, because a school is a small world, a living organism, where there can be the development of all the activities which are concerned with art.<br><br>
When I was Secretary of State, I did my best to see that school feeding was not merely a method of putting food into children but of teaching them art in the home. What better art in the home can there be than a housewife setting a table beautifully and artistically so that people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
who come in see it clean and beautiful and nicely arranged and consider it as important as the food itself. This is art, perhaps a more important are, for normal life, than even the most beautiful paintings.<br><br>
Floral art is a very interesting subject for women, and many clubs have been started. The decoration which some women can do with flowers is marvellous, as is that done by men, perhaps. The way in which they can arrange a few flowers to be a delight is remarkable. This ought to be taught in schools. Children should be educated in this direction. Dressmaking is another such subject. I am sure that every girl is interested in the art of dressmaking and of making women look beautiful. If girls realised that dressmaking meant more than simply sewing on buttons, that it involved art and design and that they could design their dresses, that would be an art related to normal life.<br><br>
Edinburgh and Glasgow Corporations, and others, have done a great deal for music. They had concerts for children, where somebody explained what a symphony was all about, and where people were not only able to listen to sweet sounds but began to understand what it was all about. People have to be taught to understand music so that they can be interested in it.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Most people have gardens, and the lay-out of a garden is a wonderful art which people enjoy in their leisure moments. It may be the business of Government to give leadership. I congratulate the present Government on doing that, but we must also take a comprehensive view, and we must start by laying a good foundation in the appreciation of the arts. Unless we encourage children to use their voices in schools, none of them will ever become a great singer on the concert and opera platform. There is in Edinburgh a scheme under which musicians visit the schools and give violin lessons. There is a charge for these lessons, but if there are children who have the talent they should have the opportunity of developing it. I agree with the hon. Member for Ayr that it is only when people try these things out for themselves that they appreciate the geniuses who do these things so well.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
I emphasise to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary the importance of personal participation. We need to encourage people to sit back and listen to the wonderful music and other things provided on television and the wireless, but we want them also to be personally active. It must be part of education not only to look and enjoy but to look and enjoy far better with the eye of experience and knowledge.<br><br>
I remember a little girl who was taken by her teachers to the Edinburgh Royal Gallery. Afterwards the children underwent a little test on the question of what made a good picture and the little girl won a prize. I asked her later why she thought a certain picture was good, and she replied, "It had angels in it, and, therefore, it must have been a good picture." We must find out what children assimilate when we talk about pictures and music.<br><br>
Some people are born with a sense of appreciation of music and of beauty of all kinds, and there are others who are born with the powers of execution in the arts. We must help everyone to take part in these activities. There will be great need in future for education for leisure. The kind of leisure which people will enjoy will depend largely on the kind of education we give them in the appreciation of the arts and of the benefits and beauty of the country. We want a race of beautiful men and women living in beautiful surroundings and doing their best to produce beautiful art in every aspect of life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is my duty to be as quick as possible and I will set myself a time-limit in the hope of finishing before 12.30 because the usual channels have advised me that the winding-up speech will begin at about 12.40.<br><br>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) on his exciting and stimulating speech. He put his points forcefully and treated the subject in a broader way than did the Under-Secretary. This was a correct attitude. He interested me by opening up the subject in a splendid way. The Under-Secretary said that the demand for the arts was constantly increasing. She mentioned that there was need to increase
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
spending on all these activities and pointed out what were the Government's plans. She argued the case for culture and for the arts with the conviction of a Mrs. Pankhurst advocating the extension of the franchise. This was a good sign. If we have enthusiasm at the top we shall have some action.<br><br>
The hon. Lady mentioned a 1d. rate. In Glasgow, part of which I represent, we spend on museums and art galleries alone about £190,000 net, which is equal to a little more than a 2d. rate. But it is a great mistake to interpret arts and amenities in this narrow way by taking the top end of culture as the hon. Lady did, because this is available only to those who are prepared to plunge in at that end. I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) mention the aspect, about which I am greatly concerned, that a large percentage of the population are unlikely to go to theatres and concerts after leaving school and are not interested in historic buildings apart from those in which they actually live. I am not entirely a cultural illiterate but I think that we should concern ourselves with an outlet for the energies of the entire population. We should concern ourseives with the use of leisure for the great majority and with the activities which can lead to the building of real communities, particularly in the new areas.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the hon. Lady refer with some enthusiasm to the cultural potential of coffee. She said that a good deal of good came of young people sitting down to coffee after participating in cultural interests. We should look at this point, but we should also think of those areas where there are few facilities for culture or recreation. I am thinking particularly of the new housing areas in our great cities. It may be said that the problem of culture and the arts is a problem which involves getting away from the great cities and into the rest of Scotland, but the problem of amenity is essentially a problem of the great cities, because we have in them several large areas which tend to be recreational deserts where there is little if any facility for cultural recreation.<br><br>
I was disappointed that the hon. Lady did not mention literature and libraries. In the housing areas, particularly, this is an activity which can be extended to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
bring culture to a large number of people. The hon. Lady did not mention parks or baths, which for a great number of people can provide an enormous potential for recreation. There was no mention of playing facilities, which is one of our principal problems. There was no mention of community centres, which are very important. There are many areas in Glasgow with populations larger than that of Perth where there are no community centres or any comparable activity. There was no mention also of facilities for old people, which can be one of the great social problems.<br><br>
We must concentrate more on this general social provision and not simply confine ourselves to questions involved with the arts. The great problem here is finance, and with the present framework of local government finance and the present powers and discretion available to local authorities there is no easy way of overcoming this problem unless we are prepared to approach it from two different angles.<br><br>
First, there is a good case for local authorities being encouraged to consider the whole question of arts, amenities and recreation as a whole. They should be prepared to set up departments under committees which would control leisure, the arts and amenities. Enormous physical problems would face the local authorities, and perhaps there is a natural feeling that more emphasis should be placed on the provision of housing, but there should be emphasis on the covering of these services by specific grants. If they were covered by specific grants outwith the general grant provision, this might help to overcome some of the problems which have been mentioned today.<br><br>
There is perhaps no better example that I could quote of the kind of problem with which I am trying to deal than that in my own constituency. In that constituency there is the housing area of Castlemill, with a population of 40,000, which is increasing all the time. This is equal to the whole city of Perth, yet in this area the only amenities or cultural and recreational facilities are a small library, one small youth centre, three Protestant churches, two Roman Catholic churches, two secondary schools, two very small Y.M.C.A. huts, one bowling green, and one tennis court. It is not possible
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
to get a cup of coffee, and there are no other recreational facilities. In these matters there is great scope for initiative by the Government. In these areas also the S.S.H.A. has great responsibilities, and if it was prepared to take the initiative in providing facilities a great deal could be done.<br><br>
I have four suggestions which I should like the Government to consider. First, on the question of planning, I hope that in future the Scottish Office will not approve plans for development or redevelopment unless it is convinced that sufficient provision is being made for leisure and recreational facilities. In particular, it must have special regard for the problems created by multi-storey flats put up in areas which are already congested and where no additional recreational facilities are provided.<br><br>
Much more use must be made of private developments. In the new housing areas shopping centres are set up by private development and enormous revenues are derived from them by the local authorities. Instead of trying to extract enormous rents, the local authorities should look at comprehensive schemes to provide leisure facilities within the private developments, thereby giving a great service to these localities. In this way libraries, bowling alleys and picture houses could be provided as part of the private development. There is great scope for this, as we have seen in some of the new towns. These things could be provided at no great cost to the local authority, though of course the corollary would be that the rent income to the local authority would be much smaller.<br><br>
Thirdly, we must take far greater initiative in the matter of providing gardens. We set up new housing areas and provide people with homes and gardens which they have not known in the past, and there is nothing worse for the morale of a community than having these gardens remain like a wilderness. Some assistance and guidance must be given. This is done to some extent in Glasgow, but this service should be extended.<br><br>
Fourthly, greater initiative must be shown in making use of present facilities, and particularly the parks. Many of them in great cities are not properly used because we have not tried to make the facilities in them appropriate to the 20th century. We must realise that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
a responsibility for providing opportunities of leisure for the great majority of the population and not simply a minority. It is essential that, if necessary, the provision of restaurant facilities should be handed over to private industry. There should also be adequate car parking facilities and organised recreational centres. There should be provision for kick-about areas and football pitches. It is much better to provide facilities for young people than that these great parks should lie empty and not be used by the public at all.<br><br>
I think that I have kept to my time-limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the hon. Member. We are now making progress.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do even better, Mr. Steele, if I manage to keep to my limit. I shall have to scrap 15 years of work in this field or try to bring it within the compass of four minutes.<br><br>
There has been a great deal of complacency about this whole problem. Two examples will illustrate this. I take the first from music. People often speak of the pyramid in music, the structure of musical performance with the many participants at the base and the few first-class artistes at the top; but the base of the pyramid is now beginning to crumble and disappear because of the development of canned music on radio and television. This is particularly so in Scotland because of the failure of the main agents of musical employment, the B.B.C. and S.T.V., to use Scottish artistes. The situation is similar, or worse, in drama. One authority, S.T.V. states that its policy is to produce no drama, and the other, the B.B.C., does not produce drama.<br><br>
The second illustration of complacency is to be found in the theatre. A few years ago, there was the sorry sight in Glasgow of two theatres, one on each side of Sauchiehall Street, being torn down. The plaster and bricks were falling from both at the same moment. One of the most chilling sights that I have ever seen was the Lvric Theatre and the Empire Theatre in Glasgow coming down at the same time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
Next, I mention our failure to use the opportunities presented in the new towns. The new town of Harlow in England installed four people as key workers, giving them houses so that they could take an active part; in the cultural life of the town. They were four members of a quartet, and they have been able to act in a fertilising rôle in the town, giving concerts and teaching and helping in the schools.<br><br>
Next, the question of the Edinburgh Festival. The shout of "Rubbish" which came from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) spoke of the failure of private enterprise in this connection is completely denied by the history of the Edinburgh Festival. This Festival brings between £2 million and £3 million a year to the town, but only £18,000,is contributed towards it from private industry. If private interests contribute enough, they get themselves a free advertisement in the official brochures, and they seem to regard this as sufficient.<br><br>
Since the Festival started, we have even fewer theatres than we had when it began. One of them is now being used as a Bingo hall. Another was burned and has not been rebuilt. We still have no opera house so that Continental companies—I know because I have helped them to do it—have to struggle as best they can with their flats and pieces of scenery in a make-shift way, and their task becomes almost impossible.<br><br>
The Edinburgh Corporation has failed to see the significance of its own Festival. It has failed, for example, to arrange programmes for the schools and visits by artistes to the schools, many of whom are prepared to do so. It was left to Menuhin to make the only effort here by his visit to a local cinema to give a concert. The Corporation deserves to have its knuckles rapped for failing to encourage interest in the schools.<br><br>
The history of the "fringe" is equally lamentable. The many examples of fine work there cannot break through the official barriers of publicity. The education committee does not maintain a proper link with the schools, failing to arrange for concerts in the schools or for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
children and others to swell the attendance at "fringe" performances. It is time that our education authorities realised that the function of the Festival is, among other things, to develop a proper Scottish cultural centre of the Festival. I see no reason why, for instance, a new Scottish play should not be commissioned each year. I do not care how bad it is. Until we get bad plays, we shall not get good ones. There have been some very fine works performed on the "fringe", for instance "Theatre Workshop" in the old days.<br><br>
The Scottish artistic tradition is not an elite tradition. It is a popular tradition. The failure to publish the Gavin Greig Collection in Aberdeen University, the finest collection of folk music in the whole of Western Europe, which has been left to collect the dust of more than half a century, is a shame to us all. The same applies to our failure to develop the School of Scottish Studies. We have two or three people there working as editor and transcribers and trying to do the work which is done at the Bela Bartok Institute in Budapest with a staff of 300.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as I can, and I thank the hon. Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) for his brevity. At the close of our very wide-ranging debate, I make two simple points. First, we should be unwise to be over-optimistic in our thinking about the public view of the arts. The hon. Lady remarked that young people have a natural flair for discrimination between the first and the second rate. In my humble opinion, they have not. In fact, they tend very frequently to be seduced by the third and fourth rate. This applies equally to the older generation, and the point I make is that the philistines are in the majority in this country, and very often in authority as well. We should remember this, for we deceive ourselves if we start from too optimistic a view of the public attitude to the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that be true, is not the reason that the arts in their best form are not provided in as great a quantity as are the less desirable products, so that young people have no opportunity to use their discrimination?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston </span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings me directly to my second point. We make a funda-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
mental error if we assume that merely by spending more money on the arts we shall create a better appreciation of them. In certain fields this may be so, but I make a quick distinction between, so to speak, the static and the productive. As the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) said, there is room for further expenditure on static art, on museums and art galleries, and on the protection of old buildings liable to decay. This is a direction in which money could readily be spent to produce a certain result. But it is much more difficult to decide how money can be spent in the productive sector to encourage the people who are developing new art forms. They are often much inhibited. The genius, the brilliant individual, tends to step out of the normal line and very often acts in a way which people generally regard with distrust and doubt.<br><br>
In conclusion, I must say a word about the Gaelic language. I was surprised that the hon. Lady did not refer to it at all. <i>[Laughter.]</i> This is not a matter for amusement, in my view. Gaelic, a language older than English, has a wealth of poetic and musical tradition. In certain parts of Scotland it is easy to show the link between language and a certain cultural outlook and the way people behave. Art has a lot to do with the way people behave. But the Gaelic language is slowly and almost inevitably dying, and it seems to me that the Government—it is very hard to allocate responsibility here—are doing practically nothing about it.<br><br>
I make two suggestions. First, the Government should put more pressure on the B.B.C. to do something regionally to encourage Gaelic, rather on the lines of what is done, very successfully, in Wales. Second, they should give practical recognition to the appointment of Mr. Donald John Mackay as the new head of An Comunn Gaidhealach. I know Mr. Mckay very well and I am sure that he will do the job well, but the Government should explore the possibilities of co-operation with this organisation to see whether something positive can be done to offset the difficulties, particularly the financial difficulties, which it faces.<br><br>
I have been as brief as I can, and I again thank the hon. Member for Renfrew, West for giving me the opportunity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
to speak. Basically, what we should all be striving for is the blossoming of the many flowers of which Mao Tse-tung once spoke in one of his more liberal moments. I sincerely hope that the hon. Lady will have great success in this endeavour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) on the manner in which he opened the debate and on his first appearance—the first of many, I am sure—now on the Opposition, and later on the Government, Front Bench. Having said that, I express my own appreciation and that of the whole Committee to all those who have spoken in this thoughtful debate. If I may single out two in particular, I thank for their brevity the hon. Members for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) and for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) who, though battling wildly against the clock, made by no means the least effective speeches of the morning.<br><br>
I shall touch on only three matters. First, despite all that the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State said, I remain as unconvinced as I was in the debate four years ago that the Arts Council is being fair in its allocation to Scotland. In 1961, I referred to Lord Goschen, the author of the formula and a distinguished patron of the arts, who was, in fact, one of the predecessors of the present Minister of State as Member for Edinburgh, East. Four years ago, the Arts Council grant to its Scottish Committee was only half the eleven-eightieths of the formula. Although since then, as the hon. Lady pointed out, the Treasury grant to the Arts Council as a whole is now well up, excellently so, the gap has widened between the overall grant and the grant which comes to Scotland.<br><br>
I entirely appreciate that Covent Garden, which receives one-third of the total Arts Council grant, is a national institution. Of course it is. It is one of the artistic crowns of the world. I also am thoroughly pleased that the Scottish National Orchestra receives the largest grant of any symphony orchestra in Britain. Nevertheless, the work of places like the Pitlochry Theatre, which I regard as a marvellous example of local artistic enterprise, could be made very much easier if a little more cash were available.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
The hon. Lady said that, in order to qualify and get in on the new building grant, local authorities must show initiative. I appreciate that the two grants, one by the Treasury to the Arts Council and the other of £250,000 for the housing of the arts, are entirely separate, but I cannot altogether understand why a local authority which shows initiative in one way should please the Government more and manage to get on the building grant lists while a local authority which spends a great deal—I have already made the point about Scottish local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i>the English ones—and shows enterprise in the staging and promotion of the arts should not be rewarded for its initiative in a similar way. But I am quite sure that Edinburgh Corporation will note the statement by the hon. Lady this morning in the context of its plans, which are still tentative, for the building of a new theatre on the Lyceum site, which I would beg leave to hope will become the national theatre of Scotland.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
The second point I want to make is that, despite all that we have said about the increase in expenditure on the arts by the present Administration, to which I, like my hon. Friend, would willingly pay tribute as something which is very well worth while, do no let us forget that public expenditure on the arts in this country is tiny, even now. I must say that I believe it reflects the attitude of the public in general, and I cannot give a better example than my own attitude when some months ago, with my wife, I decided to go to the Opera one night in Paris. We got to the Opera House and found that although there were plenty of seats available, the cheapest one was the equivalent of £5, and people were streaming into the Opera House and snapping them up. I am afraid that my reaction was that this was too much to spend on a single performance of a not particularly great opera with no particularly sensational artist appearing in it. The price of the most expensive seat in the Grand Tier of Covent Garden—I went down to verify it from the Library less than an hour ago—one finds that it is 52s. 6d.<br><br>
Let us look at the Edinburgh Festival. It gets £20,000 from the Arts Council and £75,000 from the Corporation. The Corporation supports between 15 and 20
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
other artistic ventures in a year, and it earmarks £150,000 annually for the arts, which is the equivalent of a 3d. rate. I would beg leave, with great respect to hon. Members from Glasgow—far be it from me to draw the ancient feud of Glasgow versus Edinburgh into the Committee—to say that there is no other city in Britain which does as well as Edinburgh in its support of the arts. Even so, it is very small beer indeed when one remembers that £95,000 of subsidy to the Edinburgh Festival from the local authority and the Government comes to less than one-third of the subsidy which was paid to the Salzburg Festival four years ago and that £8½ million is spent every year by the West German Government, on the arts in over 100 towns. So we have got a very long way to go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I can discuss the point afterwards. My eye is on the clock.<br><br>
The money that is being devoted to the Arts Council is, I imagine, for the purpose of promoting the arts, and not for the first time I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) described, in what I thought was a most thoughtful speech, as the aim of satisfying the finer attributes of human nature.<br><br>
I dare say that many hon. Gentlemen formed the conclusion long ago that I am quite the squarest of the squares, but I fall out with the hon. Lady when she praises the enterprise of the Traverse Theatre. I certainly wish to express grave misgivings about the way in which public money—and I emphasise the word "public"—is being spent on that theatre club, and also, if I may say so, because it is not altogether irrelevant, at the slight association—and thank goodness it is a slight one—which Mr. John Calder has with the Edinburgh Festival. So far as the Traverse Theatre Club is concerned, my information is that not long ago it put on a play which had the distasteful title of "Have you had your Sperm Test?" It was then followed—and there is no question about it because it was reviewed in <i>The Times</i> of 21st June—by a play entitled "Sclerosis". The review said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"With Peter Barnes' 'Sclerosis', we are plunged into a cruelty of real life, un-mysterious, contemporary, aimed to shock. The play is set in Cyprus during the troubles of the 1950s and deals with British methods of interrogating EOKA prisoners. A wire stockade did not give the audience much protection from the scenes of beating up, electric persuasion on the nipples, and truth drug injections. The main force of the play is in its shown cruelty."</p></blockquote>
Even if there were time, it would be out of order for me to discuss the general topic of theatre clubs and their position in the law. I will only give my own view this morning, that I do not think that public money ought to be spent on staging plays in theatre clubs which are barred from performance in the ordinary theatres of the country on the grounds of obscenity or for any other reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I really have not time. I shall break faith with the hon. Lady if I give way to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The only thing I regret about the building of the Forth Bridge is that it has made access slightly easier for Mr. Calder to get from Kinross to Edinburgh. I do not think that one who is the publisher of books that describe behaviour by human beings at which, if they could understand them, what are often called the lowly animals of the field would blush with shame is a person who can do very much good towards improving or satisfying those finer attributes of human nature to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred. I do not believe that the publication of those books is some kind of glorified psychiatric exercise in order to release the inhibitions and frustrations of young people. It is a difficult enough world for teenagers already, without people like Mr. Calder making money out of trading in what I will bluntly call literary sewage.<br><br>
On that highly provocative and contentious note, and again thanking those who initiated the debate—because I think it is one of the most useful debates we have in the four-year cycle—I sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will go as far with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) as supporting him completely in his congratulations to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
his hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). I hope we shall hear him make at lively a speech as he made this morning on other occasions.<br><br>
I want if I may, quickly—and I shall try to talk fairly fast—to cover as much ground as I can and cover as many as possible of the points which have been raised.<br><br>
First of all, on the share of the Arts Council money that goes to Scotland, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the Arts Council has to consider the needs of every different part of the country. It has to settle somehow the inevitable dilemma between the support needed for the great national enterprises like Covent Garden which are London-based, and the support needed by enterprises in the rest of the country. It is that which makes it difficult to talk in terms of exact percentages, because the whole country enjoys the benefits, very largely, of what is spent in London, and I would not accept that the hon. Gentleman's figure of 5.6 per cent. fairly reflects the share that Scotland receives of Arts Council assistance. It is true that the Scottish Committee's grant in the early 1960s had fallen from the level it had reached in the 1950s. While the Committee recognises that some variations have to occur, it is increasingly concerned at that trend, and, in the last year or two, it has been able to begin the process of correcting it. It has pressed on the Arts Council in London that it is scarcely practicable to judge between the need for music in, say, Wick or Truro by any kind of formula used at the moment, and that some new formula must be found. I understand that there is every prospect that an understanding about it will be reached in the fairly near future between the Council and the Committee.<br><br>
Taking one of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Ayr, that of historic buildings, these are largely a matter for my Under-Secretary colleague the hon. Member for Greenock (Dr. Dickson Mabon), and I will ask him to look at the point and perhaps write to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
One particular point which the hon. Member and other hon. Members have raised was the question of the all-purpose hall for school and community use. One of the paragraphs in our circular suggests
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
that local authorities should consider whether they are being as helpful as they might be in permitting local groups of performers of one kind and another to make use of school buildings. The hon. Member suggested that the Scottish Education Department should consider whether new school halls should be used for community purposes. Many education authorities are already doing exactly that, and I certainly endorse what he said, with the proviso that whereas a hall is planned for use by the community and by the school may be excellent for some purposes, it must never be thought of as any kind of substitute for a local arts centre, because the two would not be compatible in that regard.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) raised a number of matters concerning sports facilities, to which the Sports Council that the Government have set up is giving a good deal of thought. There are a number of matters that he raised which are now being considered by the Sports Council, and we are considering whether we should set up a separate Scottish Sports Council which would be able to consider the particular needs of Scotland within the framework of the United Kingdom Council. Many of these matters I will not deal with this morning, because they are more specifically—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Hart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I will continue, because I have a good many points to answer.<br><br>
The hon. Member raised the question of lending pictures to local galleries. One development assisting this will be the establishment of the new council in Scotland which has been set up with Government help and which will enable services to be shared and should make considerable advances on this point.<br><br>
Turning now to the Burrell Collection, there has been a great deal of concern about the long delay in Glasgow Corporation's providing a gallery for it. Hon. Members have also asked for fuller information about the negotiations that have been reported as taking place. I am certain that all of us in the Committee are anxious to see this collection given a setting worthy of it. We all want to see it properly housed as soon as possible, so that it can be studied by experts and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
enjoyed by people not only in Glasgow but from many other parts of the country.<br><br>
I am not in a position to say anything final today, but I would tell hon. Gentlemen that it is not because of any lack of interest or concern on the part of the Government. I have to be rather cautious because complex and delicate issues are involved for private parties as well as public bodies, and until those concerned who have trustee and family obligations have been able to consider all die issues involved, it would be premature to enter into a general discussion of why the Burrell Collection does not go here or go there.<br><br>
What I can say is that, with my right hon. Friend's authority, an entirely fresh approach has been made, the aim of which is to solve the Burrell problem in such a way that the delights of the Polio Estate as well as those of the collection may be even more freely open to the community. The Government have indicated that, if a suitable arrangement can be worked out, they are prepared to make a substantial contribution towards a solution to the problem covering both Burrell and Polio. So far, there have been only preliminary exchanges with some of the parties concerned, and it will need time to see how far these new proposals accord with their responsibilities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
I had hoped to deal with the St. Ninian's Isle treasure question, but I can write to my hon. Friend about that.<br><br>
At the end of his speech, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West raised some highly controversial points. It is the responsibility of Government to ensure that in their spending of money on the arts they sustain die freedom of the artist to do whatever he chooses. It is for the public to decide then whether it wishes to enjoy what the artist is producing. In this matter, die freedom of the artist must be protected and respected. The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) said that the philistines were on top, in his view. What we have to recognise is that they are not naturally philistines. It is our society which has made them so, and we are concerned with so changing our society that they may be otherwise.</span></p>
