	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Bill 	<i>[Lords]</i> has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></q>
Perhaps I might begin by sketching in briefly the history of earlier legislation on this subject. Until 1855, as the Committee will know, Scotland relied for its information about births, marriages and deaths entirely upon the Church. For many centuries, it was the Church's records which were the only ones available. Compulsory registration by civil registrar began in Scotland on 1st January, 1855. Before that, registers had been kept by the Church for many centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Registration, of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act, 1854, is still the principal Act. It established for the first time compulsory registration by a civil registrar. When it was introduced by Lord Elcho on 29th March, 1854, he said that it would be unnecessary for him to point out how essential it was that
	<br><q><p>"a country, claiming to rank among the civilised nations of the globe, should be in possession of an accurate register of the births, deaths and marriages of its people".</p></q>
He explained that the Government had brought in the Bill in response to representations from various bodies in Scotland in favour of better service to the public and of improved statistics for scientific purposes. He concluded that
	<br><q><p>"while the rich have their title deeds, their parchments and their sculptured monuments, there was literally no record of the poor man's birth or death except the parish register, which might not inaptly be called the charter of the poor man".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
He trusted, therefore, that the Bill would be accepted, as it was, without a dissenting voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This 1854 Act established a Registrar General's Office in Edinburgh and a body of local registrars appointed by parish councils and placed under the supervision of the sheriff in certain matters. The Act laid down in considerable detail how the work of registration was to be carried out but also provided for the discharge of the duties of registrars being prescribed in fuller detail by regulations. Ever since then, this has been the Act governing all these matters, and it has stood the test of time remarkably well. But there are now six amending Acts and numerous amending provisions in other Acts. The registration law in Scotland is thus now in need of modernisation. Not only is some of its language old-fashioned and some of its provisions difficult to understand; some of its procedures and requirements are out of date or are expressed in terms which prevent desirable improvements being made both in general efficiency and in services to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill, is, in effect, a Measure of law reform, much more than a consolidation Bill. It is a rewriting of all that is worth keeping in the present law, together with improvements inserted at convenient places, to meet current and future needs. Hon. Members who have in the past quite rightly expressed themselves as wanting legislation which said what it meant and which did not refer to many other Acts of Parliament have what they want before them in this Bill. It is an extremely clear piece of legislation. It rewrites in modern language the old legislation which we want to keep, and it inserts the new improvements which we want to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It began as long ago as the nineteen-twenties when, I am told, the distinguished Registrar General of the day, Dr. Crawford Dunlop, opened a file for suggestions for improving the Registration (Scotland) Acts, and since then suggestions have been accumulated by his successors in the light of experience over the years. The present Registrar General received authority from the Secretary of State four years ago to undertake a comprehensive review of the registration law,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
in consultation with interested outside bodies, and the present Bill is the result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unusual to find that complete agreement with the bodies consulted had been achieved at every point, but I am happy to assure the Committee that there has been a very considerable measure of agreement on the main proposals now embodied in the Bill, and I am confident that it will be generally welcomed. It has come to the House of Commons from another place, where it received lengthy and careful scrutiny, and numerous Amendments both of drafting and of substance were made, without the need for a Division. The Bill is thus one to which a good deal of hard thinking has already been given. But registration affects every one of us individually at some time or another, and there may be other suggestions coming from this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want to do is to give the Registrar-General, the local authorities, and also the public, a new code which defines the functions of the local registrars and the Registrar-General clearly, but not so tightly that details cannot be adjusted to changing circumstances from time to time without the need for a new Bill. I say this because we are anxious that the basis of the Bill should be understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that there is no corresponding English Bill, as the English Registration Acts were consolidated in 1953 and further changes have to proceed in England by way of amending legislation. The two countries differ in this, but I am assured that the contents of this Scottish Bill will not in any way cause embarrassment in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the main aspects of the Bill itself. It has five Parts. Part I is concerned with the organisation of the registration service, centrally and locally. There will continue to be a Registrar-General with his headquarters in the New Register House in Edinburgh, and a network of local registrars, the functions of all being laid down in the Bill. The Bill makes a few changes in the central organisation and rather more in the local organisation, but leans to the side of caution in both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the original Act of 1854 the control of the local registration service was shared by the Registrar-General, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
parish council and the sheriff. The broad distribution of control is that the local authorities appoint the local registrars and their staffs and arrange for their accommodation and remuneration, the sheriffs having certain administrative duties in regard to the dismissal of registrars and the determination of the registration districts and their boundaries. The local registrars carry out their registration duties, however, under the Statutes and Regulations, supplemented by instructions or advice from the Registrar-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the Bill is to simplify and clarify these arrangements. County councils and councils of large burghs have replaced parish councils for purposes of the local registration service; there is no longer a need for the sheriffs to exercise the administrative functions given to them under the 1854 Act. What is now proposed is that the Registrar General and the present local authorities will share control of the local registration service. The local registration authorities will appoint the registrars and their staffs and will determine their remuneration and conditions of service. The functions of the registrars will continue to be laid down by statute but, in exercising these functions they will be subject to such instructions or directions as the Registrar General may give. The local registration authorities will also have power to fix the hours of business of the registration offices and, after consultation with the Registrar General and subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, to alter the boundaries of registration districts. Any proposed changes will be advertised and there will be machinery for the consideration of objections. These arrangements have been incorporated in the Bill after consultation with the local authority associations, the sheriffs and the Association of Registrars of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I also contains several provisions which are of special and urgent importance. Because of the division of administrative responsibility under the existing Acts, it is not entirely clear who the employers of the registrars are, and this has caused difficulties for the Association of Registrars from time to time. A definite statement on this is much overdue, and Clause 7 of the Bill makes clear that the registrar is to be deemed to be an employee of the local registration authority by whom he is appointed.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
Then, both the Registrar-General and the local registrars are having accommodation problems for their registers, which have grown in bulk with the passage of time. The annual intake of registers in the New Register House needs 110 linear feet of shelving and the shelves will be full probably within five years. It is proposed to microfilm the registers as they come in from the local registrars, deposit the originals in a proper repository elsewhere, and retain the microfilms for search and extract. These microfilms will take up only three linear feet annually instead of 110. The Registrar General cannot make these necessary and sensible changes under the existing law, and the new Bill will give him the power he needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also gives local registration authorities power to set up repositories for the custody of the older registers held by the local registrars in order to relieve storage difficulties in the local registration offices. At present, the local registrar has no power to deposit his registers elsewhere than in his own office. The great majority of the 900 registrars are part-time officers, and many of them carry out their duties in their own homes. The practical problems are obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill, comprising Clauses 13 to 21, sets out the provisions for registration of the birth of children born in Scotland. The existing provisions have, generally speaking, been retained, but there are several new features, and I should like, if I may, to elaborate on some of these because they are important and will, I believe, be greatly welcomed throughout Scotland and, in some cases, by Scots men and women in other parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Act of 1854 was prepared, it was the usual custom for a mother to have her child at home, and, as a consequence, the provision under that Act by which registration was made in the district in which the birth occurred was a very convenient arrangement, because in almost every case registration was made in the district in which the mother resided. Nowadays the majority of births take place in maternity hospitals, some of which serve a wide area, and it frequently happens that a parent is put to the inconvenience of having to make a special journey—sometimes quite a long one—from his home to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
registration office for the district in which the maternity hospital is situated in order to have the birth registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 13, a more convenient provision has been made. In the case of any birth occurring in Scotland and where the mother resides in Scotland, registration may be made either in the district in which the birth occurred or in the district in which the mother resides, whichever is more convenient. Thus, if a woman resident in Haddington has her baby in an Edinburgh hospital or anywhere in Edinburgh, the birth may be registered in either Haddington or Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir William Anstruther-Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is speaking of my constituency. It is certainly so, but in the event of a woman living in Berwickshire having her child in Berwick-on-Tweed, does the same apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate, that is a very complex question and, if I may, I should like to deal with it either later this morning or at a further stage. It is a somewhat involved difficulty. In fact, the short anwer, is "No", but a "No" without the reasons is rather inadequate. I want to give the reasons too. For those who have a baby in a place different from the place where they live in Scotland, the Bill will apply generally as I have explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to Clause 15, which deals with foundling children. The main object of this Clause is to place responsibility for providing particulars of foundling children firmly on the shoulders of the local children's officer, who is the best person to obtain the necessary information. The provision in this Clause which the Committee will like most, I think, is that which enables a foundling child to be registered in the same way as any other. Under existing arrangements, the birth entry of a foundling does not show the date of birth but it shows instead that the child was found on a certain date. It is proposed that, in future, if a medical certificate showing the approximate date of birth is produced at the time of registration, that date may be entered as its date of birth. The Committee will appreciate what a difference this will make for foundling children who, at the moment, have a different sort
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
of birth certificate with a rather different type of entry. Now like everybody else they will have a birthday and a birth certificate which does not differentiate them in any way from other children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the objects of Clause 17, which deals with delayed or neglected registrations, is to meet the difficulties of adults who find that their births have never been registered at all. It is a very, very rare event indeed for a birth to escape registration nowadays, but fifty years ago this did occasionally happen, and there are people in Scotland today who are unable to get a birth extract because no one is available to supply the particulars concerning their birth. Under Clause 17 they will be enabled to act as their own informants, provided the Registrar General is satisfied that the correct particulars concerning the birth are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of Clause 18 is to improve the facilities for. recording the father's name in the case of an illegitimate child. Under the present Acts the name of the person acknowledging paternity of an illegitimate child cannot be entered in the register unless he attends personally with the mother and signs the register with her. This sometimes means that although a father wishes his child to be registered in his surname this cannot be done because of his inability to attend at the Registrar's Office. He may, for example, be a Service man serving overseas. In future it will be sufficient if the mother attends on her own, and produces a statutory declaration made by the person acknowledging paternity, and at the same time herself makes a declaration before the registrar. It is also provided that the father's name may be entered at a later stage if he makes a statutory declaration acknowledging paternity within 12 months of the date of birth of the child the Committee again will appreciate a valuable little reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19 provides for the issue, free of charge, to each informant of a birth an abbreviated certificate of the birth, containing particulars of name, surname, sex, date of birth and place of birth. The short form of birth certificate was first introduced under the Registration of Births, Etc. (Amendment) Act, 1934. Its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
two chief attractions were its cheapness, and its omission of particulars concerning parentage, an omission which saved considerable embarrassment in the case of illegitimate children. Because of these attractions the abbreviated certificate has become quite popular, and it is now accepted for almost every purpose. There is still, however, a lingering suspicion that anyone producing the short certificate has something to conceal, and consequently the main object of the certificate, which was to help illegitimate persons, has been only partly successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now proposed to issue the abbreviated certificate free of charge instead of the full extract issued at present, and it is hoped that as a result of the short form will soon come to be accepted as the normal type of certificate to be produced by everybody. Full extracts will, of course, still be obtainable on payment of the appropriate fee. This will help the objects behind this amendment to the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the Bill comprises Clauses 22 to 28 and relates to the registration of deaths. I have already mentioned that a new system for deaths, similar to that in relation to births, is proposed. At the present time registration of a death must be effected in the district in which the death occurred, and this arrangement frequently involves bereaved relatives in considerable inconvenience at a time when all should be done to spare them from trouble of any kind. Clause 22, therefore, provides that registration may be made either in the district in which the death occurred, or in which the deceased person had his usual residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from this, there is little that is new in Part III, but I should mention that Clause 24 provides that different forms of certificate of cause of death may be prescribed for persons of different ages, and that in the case of a child under one year of age such forms may provide for the giving of particulars of the condition of the mother before the death of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certificate of cause of death is an essential feature in death registration, and on it is based the compilation of medical statistics used on a wide scale nationally and internationally. The provision whereby different forms of certificate may be prescribed will enable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
more information to be obtained concerning infant deaths and will permit much more detailed research to be carried out in this field, a most important one in the study of the factors involved in perinatal and maternal mortality. It is in fact allowing information to be provided in this particular kind of death which medical researchers are anxious to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV deals with the registration of marriages, but of ecclesiastical marriages only. It is not among the objects of the present Bill to make any change in the law of marriage or the preliminaries to marriage. The registration of a civil marriage contracted before an authorised registrar will continue in accordance with the provisions of the Marriage (Scotland) Act, 1939. The registration of ecclesiastical marriages, however, happens to be provided for in the Registration (Scotland) Act, 1854, as amended from time to time. It would be inconvenient to leave any part of the 1854 Act outstanding—we want to repeal it all—and we have, therefore, consolidated all the existing provisions for the registration of ecclesiastical marriages with minor amendments in Part IV of the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part V deals with a variety of matters and I shall touch only on those that are new and of special interest. First of all, Clauses 32 to 41 rewrite the existing provisions for preserving, checking and indexing registers, for searching indexes, and for the issue of extracts from the registers—but setting out the procedures with sufficient flexibility to allow scope for new technical processes now and in the foreseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As will be seen, use is to be made of photographic and other methods or reproduction. At the moment, when going to a registrar's office in Scotland to register an event it is necessary to wait until he has transcribed the particulars into two registers, and then both have to be signed. The reason for this is that he has to send one copy to the Registrar General and retain the other one for use in his own office. Both are principal copies. Under the Bill, however, only one register will be completed when the informant calls. A duplicate will be made later, either by the registrar himself or, when suitable arrangements are made, by the Registrar General by means
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
of photographic or other methods. One result of this will be that informants will not have so long to wait at registration offices and the flow of work at busy periods in the large offices will be speeded up. The Registrar General will also be given powers to use photographic or other methods of reproduction when issuing extracts where this is possible and desirable. If a photographich extract is issued it will be authenticated in the same way as one written by hand or reproduced by typewriter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 42 simplifies the procedure for the correction of errors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 43 contains new proposals for recording changes of name and surname already made in accordance with the common law of Scotland and in use for at least two years. There is nothing in Scotland exactly corresponding to the deed, poll procedure in England and Wales, and for many years the Registrar General has received requests for a convenient method of recording such changes. It occasionally happens, for example, that a young man or a young woman is applying for entry into higher education or employment and is faced with the fact that he has been brought up with a Christian name or a surname different from that in his birth registration. At present it is possible to get documentary evidence of a change of this kind by means of a statutory declaration or a deed recorded in the Books of Council and Session or to obtain recognition of the change from the Lyon King of Arms. What people want, however, is to have a change recorded in a birth extract rather than in a separate document, and this is what the Bill will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original entry in the register will not be altered, but when an extract is obtained the change or changes would be shown in addition to the original name or surname.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that this is not an entirely new departure. The 1854 Act provided that a name given in baptism after registration in another name may be registered; and also that a name changed without baptism might be registered where the parents or guardians did not recognise baptism. This applies, however, only to a change of name and not to a change of surname; but it is a useful provision and is continued in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Then there are three Clauses, Clauses 45 to 47, which deal with the old parish registers. There are 4,000 volumes of these in the custody of the Registrar General in the New Register House. The oldest register, for the parish of Errol in Perthshire, dates back to 1553. These old registers up to the year 1854 were all gathered in during the latter half of last century. This was a statutory requirement of great wisdom, for otherwise many might have been lost or damaged. They form one of our national treasures, and are in regular use every day in the Library in the New Register House for genealogical and biographical research in association with the statutory registers since 1855.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This brings out a point of great importance. I do not know whether the hon. Lady can say anything about it. The Registrar General is continually receiving requests to find back connections of families from people living in America or the Commonwealth. Is there any provision in the new Bill that there will be some sort of clue given to the ancestry to avoid in the future a tremendous amount of trouble in looking up these ancestors. This has become a field of great research and causes considerable trouble. When a parent is registered, if a back number could be put on, it would greatly facilitate this research in future. It will go on for a great many years yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill at the moment which provides for this. People have to conduct their own searches of the register and in future they would conduct the search among the microfilm. What the Bill does, as my right hon. Friend will recognise, is to provide for any technical improvements to be incorporated in the keeping of registers, and I have no doubt we may see the day when computerised entries will provide information in the search of ancestry. The powers are there. There is nothing to prevent this kind of technical improvement from coming up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that the Bill does is to modernise the existing provisions relating to them, and to give the Registrar General power to transmit them, like other records, to the Scottish Record Office if the time should come when, in his opinion, it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
no longer necessary for him to keep them. For the present, however, they are in great demand and are of special interest in summer time to overseas visitors, particularly from Canada and Australia, who come to the Registrar General's Office to trace their ancestors. About 500 extracts from these old registers are issued annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining Clauses are formal and supplemental. I should just mention that the last Clause will bring the Bill into operation on 1st January, 1966. As the Registrar General and his staff have much work to do before that date, I do hope that we shall all join to see the Bill through as soon as we can, and wish him and his staff well in the work which lies ahead under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was tempted, in ending what I had to say this morning, to consider the purposes of Registration, but I understand that last night in Scotland the registrars themselves had a gathering, and that for the gathering they had composed some suitable songs, of one of which I have just been given a copy. I think it is a delightful one. I could not read it all—nor could I venture to sing it—[HON. MEMBERS: "Speak up, please."]—but I will give the first verse or two of this which is celebrating this Bill. It is called "1966 and All That" and the tune is supposed to be that of "John Brown's body":
	<br><q><p>The registration system, we are, told, is out of date,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>To modernise our methods, the R.G. can hardly wait.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>So let us get our word in now, it soon will be too late,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Let's all revise the Acts.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Let's revise the regulations,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Let's revise the regulations,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Let's revise the regulations,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>And don't forget the Acts.</p></q>
If any Member of the Committee would like to see it it can be made available. It is a delightful comment on the recognition by the registrars themselves that this is a Bill they welcome as a means of simplifying and modernising their work, and improving the conditions under which they work, and we can all join in giving the Bill a very warm welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like first of all on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends to give a general and warm welcome to this Bill. I must just add

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
that it has for me the attraction of being, if not an old friend, one with a slightly familiar face. I would like, if I may, to say to the hon. Lady, who, I suspect, has not perhaps had quite as much sleep as she would have liked in the last two nights, how extremely lucidly she has explained the Bill. She has expressed hopes for the future on behalf of the Registrar General and his staff. I would just like to pay tribute to all the work which the Registrar General must have done in preparing what is now embodied in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose one can classify under three heads the aims and intentions of the Bill. It is designed to bring up to date the system of keeping records which are quite essential, and it is vital that these records are kept with complete accuracy and as proficiently as possible. It must aim to do this in such a way as to meet the changed circumstances of the present day, to some of which the hon. Lady has referred. There has, as we all know, been a vast increase in the mobility of people during even the last decade, and this, of course, is the reason for the coming registration of births in the two different places. Of course it is essential that these formalities should be complied with as, easily for the public as possible. Thirdly, it is the duty of the Bill to work in with the requirements of all the men and women, and there are some 950 of them, I think mostly part-time, in every part of Scotland who are going to carry out the formalities of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say a word on this last point first. Some of these must quite clearly have had their work increased a tremendous amount since the end of the war, not only because of the natural rise in the population. As the hon. Lady mentioned, it has become more and more customary to have babies in hospital. This is something we all want to encourage and something which will go on as the years roll by. Up to date the registration of births in Scotland has had to take place where the birth happens and therefore, to take one example, the registrar of the district in which the Simpson Memorial Hospital, Edinburgh, is situated must have seen his work increasing a good deal. Now I should think he is likely to have less now that there is the option, as the hon. Lady said, of the registration of the birth taking place, not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
at the Simpson, but in Haddington where, I was going to say, the mother's home was, though I think that, to put it strictly right, it is where the mother is ordinarily resident. But this is something on which the lawyers can advise us. This clearly will, I suspect, decrease the work of the registrar in Edinburgh and will increase it for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is the remuneration of these registrars to be worked out? The hon. Lady referred to the proposition that the district registrars and their assistants will continue to be the employees of the local authority. There has been clarification of the 1854 Act in this connection. The local authority will provide the office for the registrar to work in, the safe in which he keeps his documents, a notice board written in clearly legible letters to direct people to the office, and it will provide the salaries. On the other hand, the Registrar General will see that the district registrar carries out his duties properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not particularly wedded to dual control no matter where it takes place. It is certainly true that one can say that in this particular field there is an improvement, because under the Bill there are to be only two parties with responsibilities in this matter instead of three, because at present the sheriff of the district holds many powers, including that of the dismissal of the district registrar. This power I think now passes to the local authority, but the local authority cannot dismiss without first consulting the Registrar General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do quite frankly believe that we ought to examine this question of dual control very carefully, and chiefly from the point of view of those in the service. If I may give a hypothetical example, suppose a district registrar is not, in the view of the Registrar-General, doing his work properly. I presume that the Registrar-General will intervene and give him what is now called a rocket, but the district registrar may very reasonably say that he cannot do his work properly because he feels he has much too much work to do. Therefore I presume that the Registrar-General will bring this to the notice of the local authority, although Clause 7 does put the initiative with the local authority, not with the Registrar-General, for appointing staff or more staff. I presume that the main interest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
of the local authorities in this matter is due to the numbers of district registrars who are local authority officers in their main work but who do a lot of registration part time. I believe that out of 950 district registrars in Scotland there are only 50 full time, and some 900 who work part time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no question, of course, that the local authority knows much more about such matters as the siting of suitable premises and the most convenient hours for these to be open. There can be no denying this, but on the other hand, if one is trying to examine this dispassionately, and I do not think it is a matter in which the scales are very evenly balanced, I suppose that if the Registrar-General were to take over the service then presumably the cost of it would be shifted from the local authority to central funds. That might not altogether be unattractive these days in trying to reduce the rate burden. If the system is to work faultlessly there is no question that the district registrar will have to work extremely closely with the Registrar-General. I think one is entitled to be anxious that such matters as salaries and the negotiations about conditions do not get bogged down because of this duality of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could I therefore put it bluntly to the hon. Lady, what is the objection to the Registrar-General taking control of this service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned salaries. They are dealt with in Clause 7 as is also compensation if employment is lost or if emoluments fall because of the operations of the Bill. As far as I can see there is no provision in the Bill for either appeal or arbitration on the matter of salaries. I believe it is a fact, and perhaps the hon. Lady will confirm this, that the whole-time registrars, those 50, can use N.A.L.G.O. for negotiations with the Whitley Council. Could she say whether this is available to the 900 who are part time? At the same time I think I am correct in saying that under the 1854 Act salaries are fixed by the local authority with the approval of the Registrar General. I believe it is also true that at present there is some machinery for appeal to the Registrar General. Is nothing taking its place within the new Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
May I return to my first point to do with the system of the keeping of records? I am sure we would all agree that much of the value of the work done by the district registrars would be very much dissipated if it were not easy to refer to them and to look them up when one wanted to do so. That brings me to the point of accommodation on which the hon. Lady touched. Having visited Register House I am in no doubt whatever of the need of the extra accommodation which is provided for under Clause 3(3). In his Report, which was I think produced in 1963, Lord Keith went into this matter with considerable care, and he stressed the need for premises which could in the fullness of time be easily extended. I do not know whether this rules out completely—it may but I would quite frankly hope it does not—the possible use of one of the noblest buildings in the City of Edinburgh situated in one of the architecturally most beautiful squares in this island, namely, St. George's West Church? Because I can think of no more suitable building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman does not mean St. George's West Church but St. George's in Charlotte Square?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. It was a slip of the tongue. St. George's in Charlotte Square. There could be no more noble building for use for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am entirely convinced, and if I was not, I am certain the hon. Lady would have convinced me this morning, of the urgent need now for the use of microfilm. In this connection I was fascinated to read in Clause 35 of the other process which is commented on and that is xerography. I felt that as the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State might well be in the Committee this morning I must certainly refresh my memory as to what, as I suspect, the Greek word meant. The full word does not feature in the Oxford Dictionary so therefore I presume that the science is a very new one. I suspect that it means writing dry, but perhaps, purely for the interest of the Committee, the hon. Lady might care to say a word about this later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point concerns the convenience of the public in these matters. I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
nothing but praise for the new provision which makes minor changes possible in the register without all the formality and expense of submitting a petition to the sheriff, as has to be done at present. That the Registrar-General will be entitled to do this is certainly a very good step. It is eminently wise to make the abbreviated birth certificate into what I might describe as the ordinary one. I hope that the custom may grow that those bodies which still ask to see the full certificate will be content with seeing the abbreviated one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to registration in different districts—this is an important part of the Bill—there is in future to be consistency in our system of registration which does not exist south of the Border. In Scotland a birth can in future be registered where it takes place or where the mother is living at the time. A death may be registered either where a person dies or where he lived immediately before his death. In each case the condition is that the place of residence is in Scotland. We have here an undoubted step forward, and consistency in the rules being the same for births and for deaths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been attracted, certainly at first sight, by the system for registration of births which applies in England and Wales. There, a birth can be notified to any registrar in any part of the country, who then forwards the information to the registrar of the district in which it took place. On reflection, I believe that for all practical purposes the choice of those two places is adequate and should satisfy an enormous preponderance of the people involved. I wish, however, to make a strong plea for rationalisation of the system. If a mother who lives in Scotland has her baby in England, she can only register it there. She cannot do it at home, even under the choice which is to be given in the Bill. The same thing applies in reverse. If a baby is born in Dumfries to parents living in Carlisle, the baby must be registered in Dumfries. This does not worry English parents very much, because it is far more popular to be born in Scotland than it is in England. Some people, particularly Scots people who live in England, go to tremendous trouble to have their babies in Scotland. I suspect that this might be designed as being to the great advantage of my hon. Friend the Member for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the constituencies which run along the English Border will be most affected, although this is by no means limited to them. Far more will be affected. If it is possible in England for a birth to be notified anywhere and for notification to be forwarded to the registrar of the district in which it took place there can surely be no difficulty about the machinery for doing precisely the reverse—I am talking not about the legislative powers, but about the sheer machinery for doing precisely the reverse—notifying a birth to the registrar at Carlisle or Berwick-upon-Tweed and having the notification forwarded to the district in Scotland where the parents live or, for that matter, doing the same thing as between any registrar's office in England or Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that perhaps two pieces of legislation would be required to achieve that. First, England and Wales would probably have to adopt this new system of ours, and I have no doubt that in due course they will. Even then, however, I suspect that the registration of births and deaths would still be confined to the side of the Border on which they took place. A second step would, therefore, probably have to be taken to bring both countries into line. I hope profoundly that this step may one day be taken. I need not say of hon. Members in this Committee that all are keen Scots, but this is not a matter for nationalistic views. It is something which would generally be for the common good and the common convenience if the day were to come when the two systems could be wedded firmly together. We shall look carefully, I hope, to see whether we can find ways of improving the Bill in Committee. I assure the hon. Lady that in doing our best to make it possibly a better Bill we shall do our best to co-operate with the Government in every way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

public, consistent with accuracy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has said, the proximity of my constituency to England causes a great many inconveniences. The nearest hospital to the east end of Dumfries, Eskdale and parts of Annandale, is in England, the nearest crematorium is in England and, of course, we have the registration problem of a large number of marriages at Gretna Green.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child of Scots parents is born in England, it has to be registered in England. There is no train service from Langholm to Carlisle by which to make this inconvenient journey for registration which if the child had been born in Scotland would not be necessary. As we all agree, there are many sentimental reasons why parents want their children to be born in Scotland. We want them to be registered as being born in Scotland—provided that they do not register as Scottish Nationalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has mentioned the qualifications for national teams, but this is not so much a problem for the Scottish Rugby Union. In including Scotsmen other than those who are actually born in Scotland we have a much more enlightened policy than the unyielding attitude of the Scottish Football Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other thing which I want to mention concerning birth certificates is what appears on the long certificate. On the Teaching Council Bill we spent a great deal of time in considering what went into the registration certificate, and this is worth a word of consideration. At the same time, I agree that the idea of the short certificate is first class. I hope that in time the use of the short certificate will grow, but only time will show whether it has been a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point which has been mentioned to me by constituents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that 17 Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room, and 17 Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the details on the long certificate. One of the matters which might be considered
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
by the Registrar General is whether details of a previous marriage of a parent must appear on the long certificate. This seems unnecessary. As long as the parents are legitimately married, that is all that should be required. It seems to me quite wrong that this extra unnecessary information should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be of interest to the Committee if I briefly explain the burden of work caused by marriages at Gretna Green. At the same time I add my tribute to the registrars for their work in Scotland. We all know the special significance throughout the world of marriages at Gretna Green. In 1963 we had 448 civil marriages in this small area. Of these, 154 were English and 161 were German couples. Of this number, 180 couples were under 21 years of age and in 60 cases one party was aged 16. The trend is increasing, and in 1964 we had 461 civil marriages. Of these, 188 couples were English, 154 couples were German, 192 couples were under the age of 21, and in 49 instances one of the parties was aged 16. Only a small proportion of these marriages are of Scots people. Many are far too young to be married at all, usually without their parents' consent and probably without the love of their parents. In many cases they are impecunious. This is no way to begin married life. I draw attention to this only because it is a trend which I regard as undesirable. The Scots' marriage law is being dragged into disrepute. This is something which we Parliamentarians might bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point I want to make is the great difficulty in the registration of death and the problems of cremation where a constituency is near the Border. In the case of births and marriages there is some notice that the event is going to take place, but in death there is no such notice given. We want a simple system, particularly when the relatives are in a distraught state. Some of the complications would be very funny if it were not a sad state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person dies in Scotland, his relatives register either at the place of death or the district of residence. All this simplicity changes if the unfortunate man dies in England. He may die only a mile or two from home, but if he lives near the Border, then Scotland is treated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
as a foreign country, just the same as if he had died abroad. If a person dies in England his relatives need a death certificate and a coroner's certificate to bring back the body to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the Registrar General's regulations the body has to lie for four clear days, so if the request is handed in on Monday it is too late to do anything till Saturday. Very often the coroner waives this and the body can be removed earlier. If a person dies in Scotland and wishes to be buried in England—perish the thought—his relatives have to take an extract from the registrar in Scotland to the registrar of the district in England where the cemetery is in order that he may issue a certificate of no liability for registration. So they have to pay 7s. 6d. to be not registered. This adds to the general confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to cremation, matters become really difficult. It so often happens that people never die at the right moment. Instead they often die at the weekends when it becomes even more difficult. If a Scot dies in England on a Friday and he wishes to be cremated his relatives need a medical referee's certificate as well as a death certificate, and that can only be obtained at 9.0 a.m., in Carlisle at 9.30. Then one might be too late because the medical referee has departed. This is a tremendous rush for the relatives, since they have to be there only 12 hours after the death. If it is a holiday on the Monday the medical referee's certificate cannot be obtained till the Tuesday. Then the certificate has to go to the crematorium by 9.45 a.m. the day before the cremation. In Scotland we are much less rigid, and as long as the certificate has been obtained before the cremation service itself this is satisfactory. It may be Wednesday or Thursday before the cremation can take place in England. If a person dies suddenly in Scotland on a Friday and has expressed a desire to be cremated and the nearest crematorium is in England then the relatives need a certificate from the procurator fiscal. He is not available on Saturday or Sunday and the earliest he is available is 9.30 a.m. on Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person wanted to be cremated in Carlisle the relatives would have to be at the crematorium at Carlisle at 9.45 a.m. on Monday so there would only be 15
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
minutes to do the 35 miles to the crematorium. This seems to be an extraordinarily complicated way of helping relatives who are already harassed. If Monday is a holiday in Dumfries or Carlisle then another day is lost and it may be six days before a person who has died in Scotland can be cremated over the Border. There is also additional cost involved. The relatives need to have two doctors to sign, which is two guineas a time. They must not be partners, and in rural districts of Scotland it is sometimes very difficult to get two doctors who are not partners in the same area. This means chasing around in cars. These doctors' certificates have to be transferred into England and this costs another 7s. 6d. to the medical referee in Carlisle. All this has to be done at 9.45 a.m. the day before the cremation is to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ultimate case is if a Scotsman dies in England and his family wish to follow the time-honoured Scottish custom of having him lie in their home in Scotland for a few days, and then want to take him back to Carlisle. This is absolutely impossible to do legally. A person cannot cross the Border twice after dying. I have had this from several undertakers who have tried to do so. However, registrars are extremely human people and they stretch a point. It may be answered by the hon. Lady that this affects only, relatively, few people, but that is not going to satisfy the relatives of those who have to go through all this nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The easiest solution would be to reopen for general purposes the hospital nearer, so they would not need to come to Carlisle or to the crematorium in Dumfriesshire. I asked the hon. Lady to use her powers of charm and persuasion on her English colleagues to see if something cannot be done about this farcical situation. All of us should remember that England may not necessarily be right. This is an important problem, because there is no time a family need help and succour more than at the tragic moment of death. I feel every effort made by the Scottish Office to find a solution will be well repaid by an alleviation of hardship and sorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
this is the kind of thing one knows something about only by some unfortunate experience—though I am not suggesting that registering a birth is always an unfortunate experience of a marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having had some experience in dealing with certificates of all kinds in the Ministry of National Insurance I realise this is a very important matter indeed for many people. I think it has to be said that the existing staffs in registrars' departments are well known for their humanity and their understanding. This, of course, will not change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather interested in the possibility of computerising the research department of the Registrar. I can envisage some interesting information coming out about our noble families—I am not speaking of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble)—if one can press a button to find out which were the illegitimate children of the Scottish equivalent of Nell Gwyn and so on. However, I do not suppose it will be made as readily available as all that to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always been a bit doubtful as to the statistical information which is extracted on the basis of the place of registration. I am talking now in terms of the existing law. For example, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) mentioned the big maternity hospital in Edinburgh. The same applies in Glasgow, and, as I understand it, the existing practice is to record all births in the maternity hospital in the ward in which the hospital is. I have never understood why this was a good thing because it seems to produce all sorts of disparities and a statistical problem, and I am just wondering whether there has been a new look at this in the light of the proposal to enable someone to register a birth either at the place of birth or in the place in which one is normally resident or last resided. This is something which might be looked at and information given to us about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must plead a special interest in this, but as it now seems that the employees are going to be treated as employees of the local authorities, does this mean there will be a statutory disqualification on them from standing for local authorities and being members of local authorities, or will they be treated as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
civil servants and be flung out if they are selected as Parliamentary candidates? Unfortunately, because of the lack of political interest in civil servants and local authority employees generally it may be something which has never been discussed with the appropriate staff associations, but in view of the shortage of suitable candidates for local authorities I think we should be interested in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a vague recollection that during the recent by-election in Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles there was at least one Registrar's office which had bills advertising a certain candidate, who shall be nameless. It was not the Labour candidate, I can say. In rural areas this kind of thing occurs because there is a great deal of latitude. This needs looking at because, as has been pointed out, there are great differences in the secrecy, so to say, that needs to be applied to 850 out of 900, which I think is the figure, of those who are part time and where, obviously, there is a very intimate relationship between the part-time registrar and the people who are registering all sorts of events. The position is entirely different in a large authority like Glasgow where the maximum amount of freedom can be allowed to members of staff because they are not in contact with the public at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point because I feel strongly about it from personal experience. It should be left as open as possible to allow the maximum amount of freedom for political interests for these employees, as possible candidates either for local authorities or Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

depressing details connected with the mortuary about which my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) gave us such interesting facts—facts which must be faced, and soon—but turning, first, to the constituency problem which I mentioned in an intervention during the hon. Lady's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Berwickshire children are often born in Berwick-upon-Tweed, because there is a particularly good maternity home there, but for this purpose Berwick-upon-Tweed is counted as being in England, and I regret to say that this disadvantage for Berwickshire people does not seem to be met by the Bill. Under the Bill, everyone else in Scotland may be registered either at the home of the parents or at the place of birth, but the people of Berwickshire, Dumfries and in the Border country are denied this convenience—and, of course, it may well be more than mere convenience to be able to say that one was born in Scotland. I am very proud of having been born in Scotland, and I am sure that many hon. Members are. Yet we are denied this. We are told that it is impossible to have the registration removed from England to Scotland, or 	<i>vice versa.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was introduced in another place and this point did not escape the attention of those who dealt with it. However, the reply of the Minister speaking for the Government was disappointing. Lord Hughes said:
	<br><q><p>"I should have liked to accept this Amendment; but I cannot because of the administrative difficulties. I think it would be an exaggeration to say 'administrative impossibilities', but there are very extreme administrative difficulties that it would cause."</p></q>
Administrative difficulties should not be beyond the capacity of the Scottish Office and the English Department to overcome. Lord Hughes went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"We have taken up the figures. There were only 65 children born to Berwickshire parents in Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1963. This is the last year for which we can give up-to-date figures. The number in Dumfriesshire born in Carlisle is probably much smaller—though we do not have the figures—as there is a maternity hospital in Dumfries. When one remembers that there are over 100,000 births in Scotland and over 800,000 in England and Wales, this, of course, is a minute number by comparison"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>House of Lords,</i> 25th February, 1965; Vol. 263, c. 995–6.]</p></q>
That may be so, but 63 Berwickshire children in the year is not a minute num-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
ber for the Member for Berwick and East Lothian. I know that the hon. Lady herself will agree that it is not a minute number for Scotland at all, and I urge her—I am sure that I am not speaking to deaf ears—to look at the matter again and to offer a solution at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn from that constituency problem to a letter I have received—other hon. Members may have received it—from the Association of Registrars of Scotland. I met a number of its worthy members in Tranent in my constituency not long ago, and we discussed these points. I shall read one or two exracts which make their point in words on which I could not improve:
	<br><q><p>"The Association notes that the Bill in its present form will perpetuate what, in the opinion of most Registrars, has been a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, namely the division of control of the registration service. … It is in fact the Registrar General who will control the system in so far as all registration duties are concerned. On the other hand, local authorities will be responsible for providing premises, making appointments, fixing hours and meeting costs".</p></q>
If the hon. Lady has not got a copy of this letter, I can, of course, produce it; but may I read it for the benefit of the Committee and of the public because of its importance?
	<br><q><p>"This situation affects three interests—Registrars and their staffs, the Registrar General and local authorities. Of the latter two, it is not difficult to see that the respective interests could conflict and have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the service. So far as Registrars and their staffs are concerned, they would have, as it were, two masters, and, as in the past, anomalies of salaries and service conditions would be perpetuated".</p></q>
I am sure that that is a point which should be looked into. The letter concludes on this aspect of the matter:
	<br><q><p>"The Association of Registrars of Scotland feels however that there is such a strong case for the centralised control of the service that, if it is not considered advisable at the present time, at least provision should be made for such a course at a later date without the need for new legislation. The Association suggests that this might be accomplished by way of a permissive clause which would allow the Registrar General to assume complete control of the service either in whole or in part at such time as might be appropriate."</p></q>
I wonder whether we could at a later stage consider such a permissive Clause.
	<br><q><p>"The effect of this would be that the Registrar General might consider at some future date, and as a first step, bringing (say)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
the registration service in the cities and/or large burghs within the centralised control of his own department".</p></q>
I am not, in general, necessarily wedded to the centralisation of everything, but it seems to me that that suggestion put forward by the Association of Registrars is well worth considering. The registrars have thought the matter over. They have found themselves as a body in favour of it, and I am sure that it should not be passed by without careful thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point affecting the remuneration of registrars, and here again the Association is not content, and I can see its difficulty. The letter says:
	<br><q><p>"When dealing with this aspect of the Bill, Lord Hughes stated that 'the negotiation of these salaries is a matter which rests almost entirely—it is almost out of the hands of local authorities—in the hands of Whitley machinery'. This is by no means the complete picture. Whole-time registrars (i.e. those whose sole profession is registration) have access to Whitley machinery through their professional Association (i.e. N.A.L.G.O.). In the event of a deadlock, however, arbitration is not possible. Part-time Registrars"—</p></q>
the hon. Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) reminded us that about 850 of the 900 Registrars are part-time—
	<br><q><p>"as such do not qualify for membership of N.A.L.G.O. and therefore have no negotiating machinery available to them. (It should be noted that the Association of Registrars of Scotland is not a salary negotiating body.)</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"Under the existing legislation, Registrars have certain rights of appeal regarding remuneration to the Registrar General. This right will be removed by the Bill. The Association is aware that the Minister of Health is at present in touch with the National Association of Registration Officers (England and Wales) regarding the whole question of the remuneration of registration officers, and it is understood that the question of independent arbitration is to be considered.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"The Association suggests that the new Bill provides a means of making some similar provision for Scottish Registration officers, and requests your interest and support in the matter."</p></q>
I gladly give my interest and support. But who am I? I invite the hon. Lady to give her interest and support also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to develop a point raised by the hon. Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown). The Under-Secretary of State drew attention to the very big part which the old parish records have played in recording the history of our country and the ancestry of many people. It seems to me that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
fact that a great proportion of people are now born in maternity homes produces a situation in which, in future, everyone will tend to be born in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries or other major centres of population. This has its effect upon many documents which people carry with them for the rest of life, for example, one's passport and so on. I suggest that there is a case, particularly in the light of our historical records, for saying that the place of residence of the parents is really of greater importance than the actual place of birth in a hospital or elsewhere in another city or county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our purpose here is to ensure efficient registration and to make it as easy as possible for people to register. There is something to be said for the system which, I understand, is adopted in England—my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) referred to this—under which people are able to register at any registrar's office and the registration is then transferred to the home registrar. Particularly in the case of death, it is probably more important that registration should be made near to the surviving relative's place of residence than where the person happened to die. I hope that this will be looked at and that, if there is anything in the point, suitable provision can be incorporated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to Clause 15, the registration of foundlings. It seems odd that parents have to register a birth within 21 days, yet registration of a foundling has to be made within two months. If 21 days is the necessary period for parents to register a birth, it seems to me that it should be possible for a registrar to register a foundling within that time, and it might well be easier in that case to trace the parents. I appreciate that it might argued that one needs two months in which to try to trace the parents before taking the final step of registering a foundling—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is assuming that the foundling would be found quite quickly after birth.

I believe that this is why that period is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was interested in what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) said in respect of the Registrars' Association but I would hope that my hon. Friend will proceed with the Bill, particularly Clauses 5 to 12, which are, as I understand it, to continue the existing arrangements by which the local authority does play a part, and particularly where the local authority can provide the service. There is something familiar in this local touch, and the local registrar, as is the dominie or the minister, is a personality in the locality. I would have thought that this sort of aspect should be encouraged and maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept this point. I think he is a figure, just like the village domine or schoolmaster.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be wrong, but is this not the intention in this Bill? As I understand it, the Registrar General is to be responsible for the laying down of the overall directions, or discretion as to how the procedure will go, for the conditions of work and so on, but the local authority is going to be responsible for finding the accommodation, and, in the end, for salaries. That is how I read it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
from the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum and having read the debate in another place. The hours are to be fixed by the local authority with the Registrar General's approval. Dismissal power lies with the local authority, although it must first consult the Registrar General. It is the Registrar General who lays down the method by which the registrar will discharge his functions. I should have thought this an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that in the Bill provision is made for the extra facility of registering births, deaths and marriages in the area in which the relatives reside as well as the area in which, for example, the death takes place. In Glasgow, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) said, people at the moment have to go to the registrar's office where the hospital is situated, and this has created inconvenience over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal point for which I thought I might ask my hon. Friend's attention was, as I understand, the point raised by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). This is the question of the issue of death certificates. It may be that the responsibility, and the need for two doctors to sign cremation certificates, does not come under this Bill. I understand this is a requirement of some old Burial Acts, but it does create inconvenience for relatives who have these obsequies to carry through to have the necessity for certificates requiring two doctors' signatures, in order, I suppose, to safeguard against untoward treatment being given to a patient before death. As a result of cremation all trace of poisoning, for example, could be eliminated. Whether it is a matter for some other Bill in order to achieve this I would not know. People are objecting, not only to the inconvenience, but also to the fact that they have to pay a fee of two or three guineas to the second doctor in order to obtain the certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another side to it. Let us take the extreme case of the individual who has insured with three insurance companies. There is the National Insurance benefit to be received; there may be some minor benefit to be received from a trade union, from a superannuation refund, from bank and Post Office Savings Certificates. Because of the act
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
of cremation all these people are asking for certificates, some of them demanding the full certificate as a copy is not sufficient for their purposes. This involves the survivors not only in inconvenience but in extra expense where full certificates are demanded. Again, this may not be a matter for this Bill, but it may be something we should look at to see whether the provision of one certificate, which is given under the hand of the local registrar, simple copies of it, or the mere showing of the certificate, would serve the purpose of these various people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad also to see that under this Bill the free attenuated copy of the birth certificate is going to be provided rather than the full copy. I think all of us understand the reason why this should be so. It is not the first time that the House of Commons has considered the problem of young people who, on entering the professions or other job, are somewhat embarrassed, and in some instances—I hesitate to use the word "penalised"—are handicapped by the fact that on their personal papers the word "illegitimate" appears. Many of us over the years have tried to show our distaste for that treatment, and we welcome the terms in which this Bill provides that the shortened version can be supplied which avoids annoyance to some young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole I think this Bill is worthy of support. It could be improved in two or three minor ways, but in the general terms in which it appears I hope it will succeed in going through the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I shall not detain for long. I really only rise to speak because representations have been made to me by the Association of Registrars in Scotland which happens to be situated in my constituency. I am happy to say that my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) has adequately covered many of the points it made, so my speech will be shorter than it would otherwise have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem to some that this is not a Bill of very great moment. Nevertheless it is one which concerns every single individual at least twice—the moment he arrives and the moment he goes. Therefore it does matter. I was particularly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
pleased that the hon. Lady, introducing the Bill, pointed out that this is more than a consolidation Bill. I am particularly glad for that reason that I think everybody will agree that owing to changing circumstances the whole situation for registration of births, deaths and marriages has become a proper dog's breakfast over the last few years, and nobody would wish to see a consolidated dog's breakfast, and I think the Bill does set out to rationalise the whole system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Registrars in Scotland has understandably expressed its concern about the division of responsibilities and control, and the fact that this Bill tends to perpetuate this. Nevertheless, I think it is difficult to see how the Bill can do otherwise, because obviously, what suits the large burghs and cities cannot suit the convenience of the more scattered rural districts, and it is difficult to have one synchronised control, certainly at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, however, it would be a matter of considerable convenience in the long term if the Bill could be so framed as to include permissive Clauses which would enable changes to be made in the future without the need for legislation. In this way we might avoid the difficulty which is going to be faced and I understand, is already being faced in England and Wales whereby there has to be new legislation every time a slight alteration is wanted. A particular suggestion for a permissive Clause was made by the registrars in connection with enabling the registrar to assume more complete control later on. Their suggestion was that the first step should include the bringing in of cities and large burghs in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be clear about what the Bill is aiming to do, and ask ourselves whether it is in fact achieving those aims. Will it, for instance, improve the whole system of registration so as to make it more uniform and more complete? Is it acting in the best interests of the citizen, bearing in mind economy and efficiency? And particularly, are the changes in the best interests of the registrars themselves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really the point on which I should like to dwell for a moment or two. It is a matter of some concern to them, particularly in relation to remuneration, rights of appeal, and hours. The whole question of hours is a very difficult one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
according to the locality of the registrar's office, and as to whether or not it is in a country district or in the middle of a city. Clearly, it is difficult to have hard and fast rules when there are so many registrars divided between those who are whole-time—50—and those who are part-time, 850. It is difficult to be dogmatic, but at the same time I think we should, if we possibly can, make this Bill as specific as possible in relation to negotiating machinery and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said—and I believe it has been confirmed—that whole-time registrars have access to the Whitley machinery through N.A.L.G.O., but as far as I can understand—perhaps the hon. Lady will confirm this—there is no provision for arbitration should they find themselves in a position of deadlock. The part-time registrars, I think, are in a rather more difficult position, because they do not, by virtue of the fact that they are part-time registrars, qualify for membership of N.A.L.G.O. I have no doubt that a great many of those who are employed by local authorities and for the remainder of the time are employed as part-time registrars are members of N.A.L.G.O. The hon. Lady might possibly provide us with figures to suggest how many are denied the opportunity of making use of the N.A.L.G.O. machinery. The Association of Registrars is not itself a negotiating body. I understand that there are some rights of appeal to the Registrar-General, but there is a suggestion that the Bill is going to remove these rights. I wonder if the hon. Lady could confirm this and say whether or not she will have any replacement proposals to make to take their place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention has also been drawn to what is going on in England and Wales. Whereas I do not for one moment suggest that anything they can do is better than we can do, I think there is probably room for a certain amount of exchange of information so that they can derive benefit from some of the things we are doing and 	<i>vice versa.</i> I am told that discussions and consultations have been going on between the Ministry of Health in England and Wales and the registrars on this subject of remuneration, and in particular the question of arbitration. It may well be that the hon. Lady could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
glean some useful information which might be helpful to us in Scotland. This is certainly a point which registrars themselves have brought to my notice, and they would appreciate the hon. Lady's ruling upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly speaking I warmly welcome the Bill. It has probably seen the inside of the Scottish Office pigeonholes over quite a period of time. I think possibly in the course of gathering cobwebs it may also have gathered some useful information which may make it a better Bill than it otherwise would have been, or was when it first went into the pigeonholes. There is certainly a need for the Bill and I for one welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would just like to say that the Liberal Party welcomes the general provisions of this Bill.—[HON. MEMBERS: "Where are the Liberals?"]—We have waited for seven months for some proposals for the modernisation of Scotland and I suppose that in beginning with the registration of births, deaths and marriages we should be grateful for small mercies. We hope that this is the shape of things to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) made an interesting point about the political activities of registrars and he referred to the fact that one registrar in my constituency was actively participating in a recent by-election. I am not sure whether the hon. Member was disapproving this, or not, but this is quite common. I would like to hear from the hon. Lady whether she imagines any restriction ought to be placed on the activities of registrars. I would have thought that as far as part-time registrars are concerned there is no reason why they should be restricted either in political or local government activities. There may be a case for saying that full-time registrars under the direct control of the local authorities should not be involved in local authority politics, but I see no reason why they should be debarred from taking part in Parliamentary politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to support the views expressed by the right hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) and by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) about the failure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
of this Bill to take into account the difficulties of those who may have occasion to wish to register a birth, for example, in Scotland when it takes place in England. I think the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) put the argument rather nicely when he said he could see no administrative objection to this, since presumably the administrative machinery for that would be no different from that for which the Bill is catering in Scotland. Is there a legal difficulty in this matter? I think that this has been the most important point raised on the Bill this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, and I know that other hon. Members are, am used to legislation coming out of the House applying to England with little bits tacked on the end saying that certain parts of it apply to Scotland. I do see absolutely no reason why we should not do the reverse. Why should we not legislate to tack on a bit at the end to say that a certain part should apply to England? I would be grateful if the hon. Lady could indicate whether it will be possible to accept such an Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Like other hon. Members I welcome the Bill, but there is one Clause which gives me some concern, and I wonder if the hon. Lady could give me some assurance. That is Clause 43 dealing with change of name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been part of the law of Scotland that a person is entitled at any time to change his or her name. That is fair enough. There has been little requirement for it in the past. It seems to me that this Clause does give a charter to criminals to produce conflicting evidence as to their names and origins. This might have been thought of, because I notice the Bill forbids the official change of name except at very infrequent intervals, and I think there is a maximum of three changes permitted except in special circumstances. There is the possibility of abuse here. A person with criminal tendencies might very well pose as three separate persons. I think that is the maximum, because he could produce his original birth certificate, he could go somewhere else and produce an extract from the register of corrections, and then even two subsequent extracts from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
register of corrections. I would like the hon. Lady to say what thought has been given to the prevention of abuses of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is not clear from the Bill, it seems it might be possible for a person like this to apply for or obtain three, or even four separate passports. That I can see might lead to great difficulties indeed. In the past it has always been possible for a person to change his name but it has not been possible for a person to produce a certificate from some Government authority such as the Registrar General, showing him registered in some way or another in the official records under several different names. I would ask the hon. Lady to give some thought to that difficulty. I do not know whether it has occurred to her, but it seems to me to be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of points which have been raised this morning. I am glad that the Bill has been so warmly welcomed in all parts of the Committee, including the Liberal Party, and I welcome the constructive suggestions and comments which have been made. All the suggestions and comments have been extremely serious and thoughtful. I hope to provide some of the answers to particular questions asked and to discuss some of the larger issues raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can I go through some of the more specific minor points first? The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) asked what xerography was. I can give him the definition that I have been given, but I am afraid that if he asked me to amplify it I should be unable to do so. Xerography is the process by which permanent copies are made by the fusing of carbon powder to the desired areas to which it has been attracted by static electricity, the paper not having been chemically prepared. I am sure that that makes it quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) asked whether the particulars of marriage could be omitted from birth entries. The point here is that these particulars are valuable in linking with the entries in the register for the parents. This is important for legal matters, for one would not have the geneological link useful in legal and other questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West also asked whether St. George's Church
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
would be used. St. George's Church, which I agree is a most beautiful piece of architecture, has been assigned to the Scottish Record Office, not to the Registrar General's Office. Additional registration accommodation for the Registrar will have to be obtained. St. George's Church will be used for purposes allied to those of the Registrar General but not for his precise ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked how the remuneration of registrars whose office is near a maternity hospital was likely would be affected by the provision to allow the registration of birth to take place at the home address of the mother. There is provision in Clause 7 for compensation. Where a registrar's remuneration is reduced by any considerable amount as a result of any of the provisions of the Bill he can have compensation. We think that no registrar will lose remuneration because of the proposal to allow registration to take place in the other district, but in the unlikely event of a local authority reducing a registrar's remuneration because the number of registrations was reduced, it would seem that he can claim compensation under the regulations made under this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I did make it clear that I did realise that the lack of emoluments or reduction in salary was covered. The question was the broader one of the negotiating machinery about remuneration generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that as one of the broader issues. There are two or three other specific and detailed points to deal with first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumfries discussed Gretna Green, which I can see is a major problem in his constituency in one way or another, and in discussing the question of runaway marriages I was interested in the statistics he gave and the background of the couples married there recently. The answer is that this Bill could not deal with this problem because it only deals with the registration of ecclesiastical marriages. If it were ever contemplated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend excuse my interrupting? It is very difficult to hear her. Could she speak up a little?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I think it is probably the effect of not having had very must sleep. That tends to make one speak a little more quietly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we chose to change the position in relation to runaway marriages this would have to be done by amending the marriage law. At the moment no such Amendment is contemplated, and that in any case is how it would have to be done if it were done at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) discussed rightly the variety of certificate for insurance and other purposes. I confirm that these are the requirements under the friendly societies, the National Insurance and other Acts of Parliament, and thus they cannot be covered in this registration Bill. The same thing applies to the point he made about the requirement of certificates from two doctors for cremation which also deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Dumfries. This requirement under the cremation regulations is again not a matter for this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the more general points raised, taking first the over the Border problem. I recognise how much concern this causes among people living in the Borders. In the last few months I have actually had cases of this kind arising and coming to my Department, not only from the Scottish side of the Border but from the English side, asking if something could be done for English parents in this respect. I agree it is a difficult situation. I think I would agree with those who have said that even though there are only 60 births in one place affected, this is a serious problem for the 60 and not to be underestimated because it is not 600. As was said in another place, there are serious administrative difficulties. I agree that administrative difficulties in themselves are never to be regarded as an insuperable barrier to progress. Nevertheless, they exist, and we must recognise them. They exist partly because of the different systems of registration on the two sides of the Border, the different forms of registration which are used and the need to acquaint registrars on both sides of the Border and make them familiar with the procedure used on the other side. That is the kind of administrative difficulty which is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) asked why we cannot put into the Bill a provision relating not only to Scotland, but also to England. I assure him that there are a number of matters on which we in Scotland would be delighted to legislate for England, but, unfortunately, we cannot do it in the Scottish Grand Committee. This would have to be a Great Britain provision. If could, of course, be done by a Scottish and an English amendment of the law, but that would be a clumsy and difficult way. The simplest thing would be to have a Great Britain change of law affecting both countries and making possible a solution to this over the Border problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising that this is a difficult position I propose to discuss the issues with those responsible in England. This will include a number of Departments, not simply the Registrar General's, but the Ministry of Health, the Home Office and other Departments. We should ask them whether they would be ready to discuss these matters with us so that even if nothing can be done quickly, at least we can tackle the problem and see what would be required. That is the most I can offer. It just is not possible to do it in this Bill on behalf of Scotland alone, because that would not solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major question which has been asked was twofold. It related to the letter which has been received by some hon. Members from the Association of Registrars. That body has raised two points, as the hon. and right hon. Members for Edinburgh, West, Berwick and East Lothian (Sir W. Anstruther-Gray) and Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) have all pointed out. The Association raised the problem of why, having reduced treble control to dual control, we cannot have a centralised system of the employment of registrars. Linked with that is the question of the negotiation of salaries for registrars. I say linked with it because the concern about the need for a centralised system is clearly linked for the registrars with the question of salary negotiations. If we had centralised employment of registrars, they think that it would be much simpler to negotiate salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
As to dual control, the problem is in two parts. First, the Bill has been prepared after consultation with all the interested bodies. The Counties of Cities Association felt that the point of view of the registrars was rather near its own. It would have liked the Registrar-General to move towards taking complete control of the system. The County Councils Association and the Convention of Royal Burghs, however, were in favour of a rationalised and simplified method of the existing system of shared control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem here is that whereas the county councils are looking primarily at the problems of registration in the predominantly rural areas, with scattered populations and a part-time registrar, the Counties of Cities are looking at it from the point of view of the large organisation where a full-time registrar has to be employed and where it would seem clearly to be logical to have a centralised system. The two points of view arise from the two different backgrounds. However, since these were the views as they were conveyed to us, it was quite clear that we could not consider, had we wanted to, going on to a centralised system of control in the absence of agreement. Therefore, we have not done it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were there to be a move towards centralised control in Scotland, this could only be done parallel with a similar move in England and Wales, because the principle of Exchequer support that would be involved would have to be regarded as a principle affecting the whole United Kingdom. There is in England and Wales no similar demand for centralisation of control. This seems extraordinary, but it is related to the question of salary negotiation and the success of achieving methods of salary negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North mentioned negotiations that are now taking place, on which, of course, I cannot comment, but I can say this. What we can best do is to give this revised system of share control a fair trial, see how it goes and see whether any similar demand for centralised control emerges from England and Wales. If it did, we could then look at the whole United Kingdom basis of this. At present, in the absence of agreement among the local authority associations and in the absence of any drive in this direction
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
from registrars or the local authority associations in England and Wales, it seems that the best thing to do is to rationalise and simplify the dual control system and give it a chance to work and see what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a point which is worthy of the most careful consideration. Do I understand the hon. Lady to say that this could not be done because of the Exchequer support that would be required? I take it that the hon. Lady confirms my suggestion that if control become centralised the burden of cost would pass from the rates to the Exchequer. Is it claimed that it is impossible for this to happen in Scotland without it happening in England and Wales? If it had been the other way round and we already had a centralised system, there have been numerous occasions when cases have been successfully made that because of the remote rural areas in Scotland, Scotland needs localised treatment. I should have thought that a case could have been made and probably won, for a localised system in Scotland while England retained her centralised system. Therefore, I am interested to hear the hon. Lady founding objections on this particular case. Secondly, although I appreciate that there is dispute and an understandable conflict of view between the Counties of Cities and the Convention of Royal Burghs, one should not altogether neglect the views expressed by the registrars themselves. They come down unmistakably in favour of working under the Registrar General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested concerning the representations made by the registrars. To whom have their representations been made? I know nothing about them. I wonder why or in what circumstances certain hon. Members opposite seem to have been selected to be given this information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not entirely the case that only hon. Members opposite were selected for this purpose. One or two copies were sent to hon. Members on this side. I ought to explain, because I inquired about this, that the Association of Registrars does not easily find it possible to achieve administrative solutions to this kind of problem to which it is not accustomed. I understand that the Association had to type the individual
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
letters and simply was not able to get them round to all Scottish Members. I think that the information was circulated on the basis of personal contact with hon. Members who happened to be the representatives of the areas in which the officers of the Association lived rather than on the more generalised basis on which some organisations communicate with all hon. Members concerning questions which come before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relating the point about dual control to the question of the dissatisfaction of registrars, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West made for me the point, with which I was just about to deal, that what matters is why the registrars are unhappy about the present arrangement. The reason why they are unhappy is clear. It is because, in present circumstances, they do not find it easy to negotiate salaries. They have one or two misapprehensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North said, they state in their document, which I quote for the benefit of my hon. Friends who have not seen it:
	<br><q><p>"Whole-time registrars—that is, those whose sole profession is registration—have access to Whitley machinery through their professional association, which is N.A.L.G.O. In the event of a deadlock, however, arbitration is not possible."</p></q>
They are misinformed. Arbitration machinery is available to them because it is available, in the event of deadlock in negotiations with local authorities, under Whitley machinery. N.A.L.G.O. has not used appeal machinery in recent years, but appeal to the Industrial Court remains open. Therefore, arbitration is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two difficulties. One is that, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West said, there are a large number of part-time registrars. The number of whole-time registrars is 58. The whole-time local authority officers, such as district clerks and welfare officers, who carry out registration duties as part of their daily work but who are full-time local authority employees total 134. In addition, there are 730 part-time registrars who have other non-local authority employment. They include schoolmasters, school mistresses, shopkeepers, housewives, farmers, and so on, in the more rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing law, the salaries which are paid are, as has been pointed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
out, subject to the approval of the Registrar General or the sheriff. This provision does not at present enable the Registrar General to do anything positive to increase the salary which he might think to be inadequate. There is, however, provision in Section 18 of the 1860 Act for an appeal on a matter of salary to the Registrar General, or, if the local authority refuses to put into effect or delays one of his recommendations, the Registrar General may refer the matter to the sheriff and he may hold an inquiry. He may then determine the salary to be paid by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether there would be anything in the Bill to provide the same kind of safeguard. There is not. As far as I know, however, this procedure under the 1860 Act has never been operated. It is not, therefore, a case of putting out of existence something which has any meaning and is in any way realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
N.A.L.G.O. is at present the body which negotiates on behalf of the whole-time registrars. The part-time registrars are under the same difficulty from which all part-time professional workers tend to suffer. Their salaries tend to reflect the salaries of the full-time workers in their occupation. When a full-time employee successfully negotiates an increase in his salary, it is reflected in increases to part-time employees. This is a general difficulty of ensuring that part-time workers in the public services are able to have their salaries negotiated for them by a body such as N.A.L.G.O. or some other trade union or professional association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essentially a question for consideration by the unions and by those concerned. There is no reason at all as far as I can see why some successful conclusion cannot be arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Registrars in Scotland, has itself pointed out, is not a salary negotiating body. But nothing stands still, and if on some future occasion the Association were to feel it desirable to become a negotiating body it could make efforts in that direction. The problem is one arising in many professional groups when the professional employee feels he must take a tough line on salary negotiations, as is taken by trade unions. He is, however, a little diffident in arriving
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
at the most suitable arrangements that will make this possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the registrars that because effective negotiating machinery has not so far been achieved this is not a good reason for changing from a dual system of control of registration to a centralised system in the absence of any other valid argument for it and in the absence of any recognition or agreement by the bulk of the local authorities that this would be a good thing. We have to look deeper into the argument and recognise in what respects improvements could be made under a dual system of control and in what respects this is a matter for the registrars themselves.

My hon. Friend the Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) and, I think, the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, raised the question of the extent to which political activity in local government or national affairs may be permitted when the registrar is a local authority employee as he will be when the Bill comes into force. I would like to look into this point further and perhaps we can discuss it again, because I think it merits serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad the Committee is so interested in the Bill. It means a lot to a great many people who will be affected by it at some time or other as members of the Committee have pointed out. I am sure we shall have a useful discussion in Committee, and I look forward to our deliberations there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. McInnes, I would like if I may, on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the Committee, to thank you for your conduct in the Chair, and for the friendliness you have shown this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, from this side, join the hon. Member in his sentiments? I think you have not had a very difficult Committee but you have conducted our affairs in your usual graceful way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again put, and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Ordered,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Bill 	<i>[Lords]</i> has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></q></p>
	<p>	<i>Committee rose at thirteen minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
