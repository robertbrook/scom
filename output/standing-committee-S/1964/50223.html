	<p>	<i>Question proposed [18th February],</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our last Sitting the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) had the Floor. He is not in his place. Is there any other hon. Member who wishes to speak to the Question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee will recall, we spent a good deal of time last Thursday debating an Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), an Amendment which in the end he withdrew. At the end of that morning we were going over much of the same ground in debating, That Clause 3 stand part of the Bill. I make no complaint, but I think that we should soon move on to other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of questions were put to me about the scope of the Clause and of the Council's duties. It may help the Committee if I say a little more at this stage. It is quite clear to me that we should not contemplate a situation in which the Teaching Council, further to its duty under the Clause of considering and making recommendations on matters relating to the supply of teachers, had some duty to make recommendations on matters of remuneration and conditions of service. This would be an impossible position because there would then be a function on the part of the Scottish Joint Council under the 1962 Act to put forward salary recommendations to the Secretary of State as a result of negotiations in that Council. We must clearly safeguard the position of the Scottish Joint Council. We must also avoid exposing the Secretary of State to statutory recommendations on salary
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
matters from two quite distinct bodies, on the one hand the General Teaching Council discharging its duty to make recommendations to him as to the supply of teachers, and on the other hand the Scottish Joint Council exercising its function of putting forward salary proposals as the outcome of the salary negotiations between the two sides of the Council. That is why the duty of the Teaching Council under the Clause as it appears in the Bill is deliberately so defined as to make it clear that the duty in respect of matters relating to the supply of teachers does not extend to remuneration and conditions fo service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are concerned with in this Clause, as, indeed, its wording makes quite clear, is a duty upon the Council. The Council, in considering matters of supply, whether in general or in relation to some particular sector of the work of the schools or further education, will no doubt seek to break down the problem engaging it as a means of analysing what is involved and of establishing what measures it might recommend should be taken. A number of hon. Members argued that it was unrealistic to expect the Council in looking at supply to ignore economic considerations. It was in the light of what they said that I took the point that it would be open to the Council, if its analysis of a particular supply problem suggested that this aspect might be critical, to make it known to the Secretary of State that this was the Council's opinion. The Council would know that this aspect was not one which it would make the subject of a recommendation to the Secretary of State, but it would be open to the Council to take the matter on the basis I have suggested. It would not, however, be a duty for the Council to do so, nor would the Secretary of State be bound in any way to have regard to any general observation or expression of opinion of this kind. This answers the point put by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) expressed doubts whether there was any need to have the Clause in the Bill at all. She will be aware that the Wheatley Committee made a clear recommendation that the Council should have a function
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
in reviewing matters relating to the supply of teachers—such matters are inevitably bound up intimately with the other functions relating to qualifications and so forth. Therefore, I consider that the Clause is most necessary, and I hope that the Committee will now agree that it should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady make clear whether this advice should be in public or in private, because it is of some material consequence whether it is in public or in private?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What matters is what the duty of the Council is and what the duty of the Secretary of State is. The Secretary of State has no duty to take account of suggestions put to him by the General Teaching Council and the matters arising from its consideration of supply which relate to economic considerations; he may feel that he wishes to take note of what the Council has said. The important question is the duty of the Secretary of State in this matter, rather than the manner in which the General Teaching Council conveys any suggestions or considerations which it may wish to convey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is of some consequence whether those suggestions are made in public or in private. It really is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill to lay down when the Council should write publicly to the Secretary of State and when the Council should write privately to the Secretary of State. When it is making recommendations that certainly will be public because the Secretary of State is asked to take account of them in making the regulations he will make. But on matters other than those relating to recommendations in which the Secretary of State has some duty under the Bill, there is nothing laid down in the Bill as to the manner in which the General Teaching Council will convey any observations it has to the Secretary of State. It will be for the Council to determine which way it will do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Lady show me in the Bill where the Council has the necessary power to make recommendations which are not covered either by Clause 2 or by Clause 3? Clause 2 imposes a duty to make recommendations
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
with regard to standards of education, training and fitness to teach. Clause 3 imposes a duty to make recommendations on certain matters, other than remuneration or conditions of service. I do not see how in either of the two Clauses there is a capacity on the part of the Council to make recommendations other than on those two categories. I now understand that the hon. Lady is saying that, notwithstanding that, it can give certain informal advice. I am not sure that a statutory body could give informal advice, other than on what it was empowered to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some confusion as to what we are now debating. As I understand it, we are debating whether this Clause shall stand part of the Bill. In other words, we are discussing whether or not there shall be in the Bill a Clause which imposes on the Council a duty to consider matters relating to supply. The question is whether or not it is proper that the Wheatley Council recommendation in this respect stating that the Council should consider matters of supply should or should not be embodied in the Bill. It is on this point that I am putting the argument that, in our view, it is highly necessary that the Teaching Council should not be looking at matters of standards of educational qualifications without relation to the general background of the supply position. I am sure hon. Members opposite would not wish thence to look at qualifications unrelated to supply. The essential point is that supply should remain a matter, as it is in the Bill at the moment, which we should ask the Council to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's statement made this morning, for it clears up a misunderstanding in relation to last Thursday's deliberations in this Committee. It was never my intention when I took part in the debate to convey the impression or the viewpoint that this Teaching Council, in the consideration of the question of supply of teachers, would be empowered to make full-scale recommendations regarding remuneration and conditions of service which at the present time are vested in the National Joint Council. I merely wanted the opportunity given to the Teaching Council, if it were felt necessary on a particular aspect of the consideration of the supply of teachers, that it should be empowered to make a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
recommendation or give an expression of opinion. In view of the assurances given by my hon. Friend, I am quite prepared to support the Clause as it now stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should get on, as the hon. Lady says. The hon. Lady started off at our last Sitting quite firmly that recommending on the problems of remuneration and conditions of service was not what the Council should do. Then the debate began to take on a slightly different form—that whereas recommendations might not be proper, it makes a considerable difference as to whether observations are made in public or in private. In view of the fact that my hon. and learned Friend is seriously worried about the powers and capabilities, my view is that this Clause should not stand part of the Bill but that the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Clause 4. (SECRETARY OF STATE TO HAVE REGARD TO RECOMMENDATIONS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very small point, but is one on which the Committee may well agree with me. Having looked at the Clause with some care, I consider that it adds little if anything to the Bill. All it says is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising his functions … the Secretary of State shall have regard to any recommendations made to him by the Council …"</p></blockquote>
It is unthinkable that any Secretary of State who sets up a body of this sort should not have regard to what it says, whatever the phrase "have regard" is meant to mean. It is also unthinkable that the Council should feel that there might be some circumstances in which a Secretary of State should not have any regard to what it says. I do not, therefore, believe that this small Clause adds one iota to the Bill, and I consider it might well be left out. I have no doubt that the Parliamentary draftsman who put the
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
hon. Lady should have a look at the whole position and the wording before Report and put down an Amendment which would be more suited to the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to do that. It would, in my view, be quite wrong to suggest that a Clause which gives to the Council the duty of considering questions of supply should go out of the Bill. I shall, of course, be looking at the wording between now and Report to see if there can be any improvement in it, but I am not prepared to do it on the basis of withdrawing the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>Clause into the Bill thought to himself, "This is fairly common form, we often make little Clauses of this sort that mean nothing, so we will do it again". This is not adequate reason for having it in. Unless the hon. Lady has some particular point in mind, I consider the Clause might well be left completely out of the Bill. It would save everybody's time and a certain degree of insult to the Secretary of State if it were left out.</p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that it is not the practice of Parliamentary draftsmen to put Clauses into Bills unless they think that they are needed. If the right hon. Gentleman doubts that, the onus is on him to show, rather more firmly, clearly and convincingly than he has, that the Clause is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It requires the Secretary of State to have regard to recommendations made to him. This is in line with the general spirit of the Bill. It provides that in exercising his statutory functions in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
relation to education in Scotland under the Education (Scotland) Acts of 1939 to 1964, including those giving him power to make regulations, he shall take into account recommendations made by the Council under Clauses 2 and 3. If the Clause were not included, there would be nothing to ensure that due attention was paid to the advice of the Teaching Council. The right hon. Gentleman is again falling victim to his desire on the one hand to support the general provisions of the Bill and on the other to circumscribe its effect. I can assure him that the Clause is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is weaker than she has been so far, and that is saying a good deal. The Clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Secretary of State shall have regard to any recommendations …".</p></blockquote>
Clause 7(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Secretary of State shall, before making regulations under this section, consider any relevant recommendation …".</p></blockquote>
Is there any significance in the difference between the two phrases? If there is not, why should there be two separate phrases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, it is insulting both to the Committee and to the Secretary of State to suggest that, having set up this considerable body, the Secretary of State should have to have a Clause in a Bill to say that he shall have regard to recommendations. That is quite childish. The Clause has no other function and does not even use the same words as Clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady keeps suggesting that in some way I wish to circumscribe the powers and duties of the Council, but our argument on this occasion has nothing to do with that. This may be a purely drafting matter, but there appears to be no function for this Clause. The hon. Lady has not said that there is a function and I think that it should not be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the completion of a process. We have spent a great deal of time talking about Clauses 2 and 3 which both refer to the Secretary of State considering recommendations and so on. Here we are merely topping off what we have been doing by saying that the Secretary of State shall have regard to these matters. There may seem
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
to be some redundancy about the Clause, but I have had a long experience of what Secretaries of State can do and I have known many occasions in the last thirteen years when I have asked a Secretary of State what he has been doing about this, that and the next thing. The right hon. Gentleman will remember many occasions when we have cross-examined him about what he proposed to do and what he was thinking of doing about certain matters raised in the House and remitted to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether he or any of his hon. Friends would have been in the least satisfied if I or my predecessor had replied that we were "having regard" to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is merely a get out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no use saying that it is not, for the right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that it is. That argument could be extended by asking how much regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two Clauses have been considered carefully and at length and we now say in Clause 4 that the Secretary of State, whoever he may be, will have to have regard to what we have been saying, which is a perfectly logical thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that we are perfectly in order, as the Clause refers to Clauses 2 and 3, to ask the hon. Lady to finish her remarks, particularly about Clause 3. I asked her two specific questions. One concerned paragraph 151 of the Wheatley Report, and she will see from column 91 of the OFFICIAL REPORT for last Thursday's meeting that I asked her whether she would tell the Committee whether the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee were being carried out when it suggested that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Departmental Committee on the Supply of Teachers which is at present appointed by the Secretary of State to review and make forecasts of the supply of teachers, should in future be appointed jointly by the Secretary of State and the Council, reporting directly to both. Such changes in membership of the Council should be made as are required by this change".</p></blockquote>
As Clause 4 asks the Secretary of State to have regard to the contents of Clause 3, I hope that the hon. Lady will answer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
that important question which she failed to answer earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question is whether she will say something about the supply of teachers. The Secretary of State devoted so much of his opening speech to the subject of the supply of teachers as to take no fewer than four columns of HANSARD for that part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The noble Lady is getting a little out of order in asking these questions. The Clause deals with recommendations to the Secretary of State. Will she bring her remarks nearer to the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I trusted that I was in order when I pointed out that Clause 4 says that the Secretary of State must have regard to recommendations made to him under Clauses 2 and 3. Clause 3 concerns the supply of teachers and I hope that we shall hear something about that from the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support what my right hon. Friend has said about Clause 4 not being necessary. I do not see what would be the point of having Clauses 2 and 3 if the effect were merely that the Secretary of State need not have any regard to recommendations of the Council. It is extraordinary that we should be asked to make sure that the Secretary of State will pay attention to what is put to him publicly or privately about these vital matters, unless it is that the present Secretary of State has no intention of having regard to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a reasonable explanation of this phrase "have regard to" that there would be an obligation on the Secretary of State, if he were making regulations contrary to what the Council had suggested, publicly to give his reasons, in that way publicly having regard to what had been said in that he would have to explain why he had not accepted the recommendations? Without the Clause, he would be able completely to ignore any recommendations and even to make regulations in the contrary direction without having to give an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 7(5) goes even further than Clause 4 and requires the Secretary of State to
	<br><blockquote><p>"publish in such manner as he thinks fit a statement indicating the terms of the recom
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
mendation and his reasons for refusing to make regulations giving effect to it."</p></blockquote>
Not only has he to have regard to recommendations but to publish his reasons for refusing to accept them. Clause 4 thus becomes utterly meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has said that Parliamentary draftsmen are not in the habit of including Clauses which have no meaning. I do not know who the Parliamentary draftsmen are, but the hon. Lady is responsible for the Bill and she must justify it and not pass the buck to some Parliamentary draftsmen behind the scenes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard my hon. Friend's speech and it was not she who attributed the blame, if any, to Parliamentary draftsmen. If the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is saying that there are further powers in Clause 7, why is he complaining about Clause 4?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument seems to be at variance with that of the right hon. Gentleman who said that there was nothing in Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that it has been said that Clause 4 is needed because without it the Secretary of State for some reason might not have regard to the recommendations of the Council. This is insulting to the Secretary of State. Furthermore, in Clause 7 there are detailed and exact provisions which say that, if he ignores recommendations, he must state his reasons publicly. I am not saying that there is any harm in Clause 4, but merely that it is totally unnecessary and that we should, therefore, leave it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause requires the Secretary of State to have regard to recommendations. It is difficult to find similar powers elsewhere. There is no corresponding requirement in Clause 7 about advice which may be tendered by the Scottish Council on the Training of Teachers, which may give advice which may or may not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has said, perhaps much better than I can, is a finishing off of a process
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
begun in Clauses 2 and 3. By Clause 4 the Secretary of State is required to exercise his functions. The whole purpose is to ensure that attention is paid to the Council's advice, and this goes somewhat further than the existing regulations provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady spoke about the supply of teachers. If one considers what the E.I.S. said over the weekend, one realises the sort of things which the Council can consider. I do not propose to take this any further than to enumerate some of the items which might well be considered by this Council. It might consider, for example, the wisdom of giving grants to graduates equivalent to first year salaries, improvement grants under the special recruitment scheme or any other improvements which may be made under that scheme, efforts to train and recruit married women, the new fourth year Bachelor of Education course suggested for universities, and courses for uncertificated persons. The Teaching Council could consider all those things and give its opinion on them. That is the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, one wants to consider this matter further I should have thought that paragraph 103 of the Wheatley Report covered the whole situation. The Report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sometimes the proposals are modified as a result of the observations received and sometimes carried into effect in final Regulations without change. The effect of this arrangement … is that teachers are suspicious of proposals emanating from Government sources, for they fear that the minds of those in authority are already made up, and they feel that changes are being imposed on the profession from above."</p></blockquote>
We cannot consider the Bill, and in particular Clause 3, without bearing in mind the climate which led to the strike in Glasgow. It was due to a breakdown in confidence. The Bill, and in particular Clause 3, would help to improve the atmosphere and avoid what has happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked what my hon. Friend intends to do about the recommendation in paragraph 151 of the Wheatley Report. I think that she must have asked that because of a troubled conscience. From 1951 onwards successive Secretaries of State did nothing about
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
the Departmental Committee Reports which were provided every three years. My hon. Friends and I often asked the Secretary of State of the day what was happening about these Reports, but we received no satisfactory answers. We had the Knox Committee Report in 1958, but even then no action was taken, and now the hon. Lady has the effrontery to ask my hon. Friend, after the Government have been in office for only four months, what she proposes to do about such reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is neccessary to give the teachers confidence that when recommendations emanate from the Council the Secretary of State, at long last, will pay some regard and attention to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that hon. Member's opposite have slightly misunderstood the relationship between Clause 4, and indeed Clauses 2 and 3, and Clause 7. Clause 7 refers specifically to the powers of the Secretary of State to make regulations with regard to qualifications for registration. It does not, as Clause 4 does, ask him to pay regard to recommendations other than those specifically covering qualifications for registration. Thus, the argument adopted by the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends with regard to Clause 4 being unnecessary because of the provisions of Clause 7 is a little off the beam. Clause 4, as my hon. Friends have said, is the follow-through in asking the Secretary of State to have regard to the recommendations made by the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about the Departmental Committee on the Supply' of Teachers. She was probably right in saying that we should discuss this in terms of referring to the previous Clauses. As the hon. Lady pointed out, the Wheatley Committee recommended that the Departmental Committee on the Supply of Teachers, which is at present appointed by the Secretary of State to review and make forecasts of the supply of teachers
	<br><blockquote><p>"should in future be appointed jointly by the Secretary of State and by the Council, reporting directly to both."</p></blockquote>
We shall keep this recommendation very much in mind. As the hon. Lady appreciates, there is no need to include a provision on this in the Bill. The Departmental Committee has never had any statutory existence, and I do not think that anyone would suggest that there was any need to give it a statutory basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
The appointment of committees of this kind as between the Secretary of State and the Council would be a matter of arrangement in the ordinary course of events, and in matters like this it is sensible and reasonable to look for flexibility so that we can adapt the committee machinery to meet the changing requirements of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Departmental Committee on the Supply of Teachers, to which the hon. Lady and the Wheatley Committee referred, is not a standing committee in the sense that it is always in being. The last Report, the fourth one, was published in January, 1962, and the Committee has not sat since the preparation of that Report. This does not mean that a detailed and continuing study of the problem of the supply of teachers has not been going on, but the fact is that the figures in the last Report have been superseded by the forecasts made by the Robbins Committee on Higher Education in its Report of November, 1963.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 18, to leave out "other".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really a probing Amendment. From the grammatical point of view the word "other" could be left out, but I would not have put down the Amendment if that were the only reason for it. Subsection (1) imposes on the Council a duty to do two things. First,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to keep themselves informed of the nature of the instruction given in colleges of education"</p></blockquote>
and, secondly,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to undertake such other functions in relation to colleges of education as may be assigned to them by the Secretary of State by regulations made under section 81 of the Act of 1962.…"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
ruled one hon. Lady out of order, I must be consistent. I hope that the hon. Lady will come back to the Question under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Brewis, I had no intention of enlarging the discussion to cover supply in general. I merely wanted to answer the specific point made by the hon. Lady. I think she can take it, from what I have said, that there are figures from the Robbins Committee which enable us to consider this in the light of new machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough in reply to the hon. Lady's question, and with regard to relating Clause 4 to its essential follow-through function in the Bill, to separate it somewhat from the point made by the right hon. Gentleman about Clause 7, and to convince the Committee that Clause 4 should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14, Noes 12.</p>
	<p>It seems to me, from reading those two subsections, that the meaning would be clear if the word "other" were omitted altogether.</p>
	<p>I would be interested to know what the hon. Lady has in mind when she speaks of
	<br><blockquote><p>"functions in relation to colleges of education as may be assigned to them by the Secretary of State … under section 81 of the Act of 1962"</p></blockquote>
and so on. I think I know what she has in mind, but I should like to hear it from her. Does she have in mind, for example, that the provisions of Section 81(2) of the 1962 Act already apply to colleges of education, or is she bringing colleges of education into that Section by this Clause of the Bill? If it is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
former, it is rather odd that Section 81 talks about setting up
	<br><blockquote><p>"committees and other bodies for the training of teachers."</p></blockquote>
It does not deal in terms with colleges of education, although such colleges are defined in the interpretation Section of the Act. It rather suggests, on a 	<i>prima facie</i> reading of Section 81, that colleges of education do not fall within its ambit, but I would be interested to know what type of functions under Section 81 it is envisaged may be assigned by the Secretary of State under this Clause.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that this is a probing Amendment, and I am glad to offer the hon. and learned Gentleman the explanation that he wants. The Clause requires the Council, first, to keep itself informed of the nature of instruction in colleges of education, and, secondly, to undertake such other functions as the Secretary of State may assign to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with the drafting point first, the effect of the Amendment would be that under subsection 	<i>(1,b)</i> the Council would simply undertake such functions as the Secretary of State may assign to it. The implication of that would be that the duty under subsection 	<i>(1,a)</i> namely, the duty of the Council to keep itself informed about the nature of instruction, would not be a function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is largely a probing Amendment. The functions are defined in the 1962 Act as including powers and duties, and in the terms of subsection (2) any expression used in this Bill has, unless the context otherwise requires, the same meaning as it has in the Act. Any expression in the 1962 Act has the same meaning in the Bill, so the implication is unjustified. The task laid down in subsection 	<i>(1,a)</i> is clearly a duty. Therefore the word "other" is appropriately used, and the other functions are added on to the duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general question, Section 81 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for setting up, altering and dissolving committees and other bodies for the training of teachers. In these regulations he may
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribe the duties to be performed by the said committees or other bodies".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
The Regulations currently in force are the Teachers (Training Authorities) (Scotland) Regulations, 1958, under which the old National Committee for the Training of Teachers was swept away and replaced by the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers and by governing bodies of colleges of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the establishment of the Council still further changes will be necessary. Revised regulations will be required to cope with the winding up of the Scottish Council. That will go out of existence. At this stage it is my right hon. Friend's intention, in exercising his power to prescribe the duties to be performed by the governing bodies of colleges of education, to include in the revised regulations the duty of a governing body to implement a recommendation of the Council where required to do so by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of subsection (1) is to enable the Council to assume certain co-ordinating and advisory functions, in relation to colleges, which are at present exercised by the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers. A recommendation in this sense was made by the Wheatley Committee in paragraph 159, which suggested what might occur. Examples of the functions at present discharged by the Scottish Council and which might be assigned to the General Teaching Council are advice to governing bodies on any major new developments which may be thought desirable—for example, the improved provision of physical facilities such as libraries—or the development of new techniques, such as closed circuit television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "other functions" may include advice on medical standards in order to ensure uniformity of treatment of individual cases. There are many matters of this kind in which it might be appropriate for the Council to assume these co-ordinating and advisory functions. I hope that I have answered the hon. and learned Member's points and explained the purpose of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the hon. Lady for her explanation, which is the kind of full explanation that a probing Amendment of this nature is designed to elicit, but I confess that I would have thought that the grammatical point was still in my

	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
favour. If subsection (1,a) deals with duties and subsection (1,b) with functions—and I agree that the definition Section of the 1962 Act is imported into this legislation—I would have thought that there was even less need for the word "other", if we are dealing with two contrasting matters. But I would never have moved the Amendment if that were the only reason in my mind, and in all the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 40, to leave out from "college" to the end of line 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady will recall that I raised this question during our debate on the principle of the Bill. Although she was good enough to reply to several of my points she did not mention this one. The purpose of the Amendment is to discover exactly what is the position, and what are the powers possessed by the Secretary of State in this matter. It will be observed that under the provisions of subsection (3), if the Council, as the result of a report under subsection (2), considers that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change should be made in the general content or arrangement of courses of instruction provided in any college of education the Council may make recommendations in that behalf to the governing body of that college".</p></blockquote>
It is the following part of that subsection which my Amendment seeks to delete. It goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if, after consultation between the Council and the governing body, and any resulting modification by the Council of the recommendations, the governing body refuses to accept the recommendations (or, as the case may be, the recommendations as modified) the Council may report the circumstances to the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
There appears to be a full stop there. What happens after that? Does the Council merely report the circumstances to the Secretary of State? What does the Secretary of State do? Does he have any authority or power to direct the college of education to alter a course as recommended by the Council? Is is merely a fact which is reported to him, and which makes it possible, under Section 81 (3,b,ii) of the 1962 Act, for assistance or advice to be given to other bodies such as colleges of education? Does this subsection confer any authority upon the Secretary of State to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
use of and to assist on the recommendations put forward for the content of courses by the Council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years colleges of education have obtained much greater automony in relation to courses, and it may be that the fact that the four principals will be on the Council will provide all that is necessary. It is very unlikely that there will be any major dispute on that matter. Nevertheless, paragraph 117 of the Wheatley Report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we recommend that, in the unlikely event of the Council's finding serious fault with the adequacy of the training given in a particular college and the refusal by the college to put into practice the recommendations of the Council, a residual power should be available to the Secretary of State, to direct, on the recommendation of the Council, the college of education to act in accordance with the recommendations. Such a power corresponds to that conferred on the Privy Council in relation to medical schools, though the effect of the latter power would be to withdraw recognition of the qualification granted by the medical school."</p></blockquote>
We all realise that much of the Bill will be carried out by regulations, and in her speech on the previous Amendment the hon. Lady herself pointed out that these regulations would, to use her own words, "impose a duty on a governing body to implement a recommendation". It is therefore important that we should have a clear statement from the hon. Lady as to whether or not the Secretary of State has power, on the advice of the Council, to direct a college of education to alter the content of its courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can give the noble Lady the explanation she has asked for. I am sorry that I was not able to give it when we debated the principle, but we ran a little short of time towards the end of the morning. I realise that this is a probing Amendment. I do not take it that the hon. Lady wishes to leave these words out—unless she finds something eminently unsatisfactory about my reassurances. I also realise that several people have expressed concern as to exactly what powers the Secretary of State will have in this matter—especially the E.I.S.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lady did not quote the letter which it has written to the Scottish Members but it has expressed itself as concerned to get a full account of how the Secretary of State would propose to exercise his powers. The hon. Lady
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
was right to quote from paragraph 117 of the Wheatley Report, which says that a power should be available to the Secretary of State to direct a college of education to act in accordance with the General Teaching Council's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let us accept that it is unlikely that there will be disagreement between the Council and colleges of education in the implementation of any recommendation from the Council under the terms of the Clause. The principals of the colleges will be on the Council. It will be a responsible body, and disagreement is not likely. Let us not discuss the question in such terms as to imply that disagreement would constantly arise. But if the situation did arise in which the Secretary of State of the day considered that a particular recommendation to which a college objected should be acted upon, he would have ample power to ensure that what he thought should be done was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the college did not comply with the requirements, under the terms of section 81 of the 1962 Act the Secretary of State would be able to invoke the provisions of Section 71 of that Act which confer upon him power to enforce the duty on education authorities and other managers of educational establishments, including colleges of education. In the terms of that Section, if the authorities or the other managers have failed to discharge any duty imposed on them by or for the purposes of the Act, the Secretary of State may make an order declaring them to be in default in respect of that duty and require them, before a date stated in the order to discharge that duty. In the event of continued refusal one or other of the following steps can be taken. First, the Secretary of State may make arrangements himself for the discharge of the duty and for all the expenses which he may incur in so doing to be recovered as a debt from the authority or managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is referring to a case where there is disagreement about a recommendation of the Council, but let us suppose that the Secretary of State agrees with the views expressed by the college of education and disagrees with the Council. Nothing is laid down as to what he should do in that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend, the Amendment is concerned only with the powers of the Secretary of State to compel a college of education to do something which he thinks it should do. The question of the way in which this arises is something different. I should be out of order if I sought to answer my hon. Friend's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was explaining what steps the Secretary of State could take under Section 71 of the 1962 Act, if the managers of a college of education—the governing body—were not doing what he thought they should do. I was explaining that he could make arrangements himself for the discharge of the duty and for the expenses which he incurred in doing so to be recovered as a debt from the authority or the managers. Secondly, it could happen that the Court of Session, on the application of the Lord Advocate, could order the specific performance of the duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee and the noble Lady will recognise that we do not envisage that these powers would ever have to be used. It is not a common situation. But these provisions would be adequate to secure the implementation of the Wheatley Committee's recommendation that the power should be available to the Secretary of State to direct a college of education to act in accordance with the recommendations. Nothing further is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council's power to make recommendations for changes in the colleges relates to the general content or arrangement of courses, and this reflects the Wheatley Committee's recommendation. It is not envisaged that the Council will become involved, or want to become involved, in any detailed way with the conduct of the colleges and their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am obliged to the hon. Lady for the explanation she has given. She is right in saying that Section 71 gives the necessary powers, although I should not have thought that at the time that Section was framed the framers of the Section had this type of situation in mind; but it is sufficiently wide to deal with this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Secretary of State has power under Section 71, I should have thought that it would be better not to leave Clause 5(3) in the air. As my noble
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
Friend pointed out, the subsection ends in this way:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and if, after consultation between the Council and the governing body, and any resulting modification by the Council of the recommendations, the governing body refuses to accept the recommendations (or, as the case may be, the recommendations as modified) the Council may report the circumstances to the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It would be more readily understood if the Clause then read on in this way:
	<br><blockquote><p>who shall have regard to any such recommendations (or, as the case may be, recommendations as modified) in the exercise of his powers under Section 71 of the Act of 1962."</p></blockquote>
I suggest to the hon. Lady that, in the light of her explanation as to where those powers are to be found, the Clause would be more readily understood and would be improved by a reference to what the Secretary of State ought to do, rather than its merely being left in the air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me if I tell the Committee that I find myself a little surprised that he, having previously supported his hon. Friend's argument that the Secretary of State should not have regard to certain matters, now wants the Secretary of State to have regard to something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman's main point is this. There is a very reasonable argument on this one. It might have been thought that there should be a follow-through of the kind the hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested. The argument against it is this. Notwithstanding the powers that will be available to ensure that the colleges would comply with a recommendation by the Council, when the Secretary of State has endorsed a recommendation of the Council the matter then passes from being one between the Council and the governing body of a college of education to being one between the Secretary of State and a governing body. In relation to the Secretary of State, governing bodies look for the totality of their powers and duties for the administration of the teacher training system to the Training Authorities Regulations made under the 1962 Act. Regulations under that Act—amended Training Authorities Regulations—are the proper place in which to deal with this matter. In other words, there would be a follow-through, but a follow-through not provided for in the Bill, but in revised Regulations under the Act which gives the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
his powers in this matter. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that this is an appropriate way to deal with the follow-through point he made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first apologise for not being present at the beginning of this debate? I am not clear on one point. What will be the position if the colleges become, as many of us hope that they will, steadily more independent, then perhaps get connected on to universities, and in due course issue their own degrees? They will then be outside the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State. This is a process which may not be very long delayed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill assumes that the colleges of education, as they are at the moment or as they might develop, but still being colleges of education, should have a certain relationship to the Council, on the one hand, and to the Secretary of State, on the other. Any changes which were so fundamental and so radical in the colleges of education that they were no longer enabled to come within the ambit of the Bill would clearly require some consideration, and in particular some reconsideration of the Regulations. It would depend on the way in which they were being financed. So long as the financing of the colleges of education were such as to give the Secretary of State the powers he has under the 1962 Act the point about which the right hon. Gentleman is concerned would not arise. In fact, that point could arise only if the financial relationship of the colleges of education to the Secretary of State were fundamentally changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Clause 4 is as important as the hon. Lady said it was, it is essential that there should be some provision in Clause 5 that the Secretary of State will have regard to these recommendations. The duty to have regard to recommendations under Clause 4 relates only to Clauses 2 and 3. Clause 7 deals with regulations made under that Clause. If it is important and if a distinction is drawn, it may be that Clause 5(3) would be interpreted in contrast to the other "have regard to" provisions as recommendations to which the Secretary of State need not have regard. If a provision is written into a Bill to the effect that regard must be paid to certain circumstances and if then there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
is a Clause which deals with recommendations and there is not a word about the Secretary of State having to pay regard to them, it may be arguable that in that case Parliament has advisedly left out the obligation to have regard to those provisions. If the hon. Lady is right about Clause 4—she obviously feels that she is—it would be advisable to have another look at this with a view to this provision being written into Clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly look at this. I recognise that there is a reasonable argument here. On the previous Clause the hon. and learned Gentleman argued that the Secretary of State should not have regard to certain matters, but on this Clause he is arguing that the Secretary of State should have this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we must be consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Likewise, I am prepared to agree that I ought to be consistent. I am perfectly happy to have a look at this. I undertake to have a good look at it before Report and see if what the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the explanation which has been given and of the hon.

	<div class='title'>Clause 6. (ESTABLISHMENT OF REGISTER.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 3, to leave out "such".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient to the Committee if with this Amendment we discuss the following Amendment, in page 3, line 4, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>" and other particulars as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that will be helpful, Mr. Brewis. This Amendment is
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
entirely tied up with the Amendment in page 3, line 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Parliament is being asked to ratify here is a duty on
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Council to establish and keep a register containing the names, addresses and such qualifications and other particulars as may be prescribed, of persons who are entitled under the following provisions … to be so registered".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that that provides very wide powers on the part of the Council to build up a register containing a great deal of confidential and personal information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not quite know what is meant or what the hon. Lady has in mind by "other particulars as may be prescribed". If it is to include a great deal of private and personal matter one would want to know much more about how the register is to be compiled and who is to compile it. For example, who is to provide the information which will get on to the register, if it is to include all these highly personal and confidential matters? If the register is to include such matters, who will have access to it? In the interests of the individual teacher concerned it is absolutely essential that, if the register is to include such highly personal and confidential matter, the individual teacher should have ready access to it. It may be that if a confidential report or a personal report is being made about the individual the individual ought to be entitled to know about it at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with such difficulties as these in mind that the two Amendments have been tabled. I should not have thought it was necessary in the compilation of such a register to include more than the names, addresses and qualifications of the individuals concerned. I shall be interested to know from the hon. Lady what are the other matters which she feels are so important as to be referred to in such all-embracing terms in subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly offer the explanation asked for by the hon. and learned Gentleman. He said that all he wants there to be on the register are the names, addresses and qualifications of the individuals concerned. He asked what other particulars it might be desirable to have on the register. I emphasise the word particulars, because the Amendment refers to such "other particulars as may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
be prescribed". So we would be limited by the word "particulars" even if the Amendment were to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two particulars which, I think, might well be required. For example, the Council might wish to include the date of birth in order to facilitate identification. The Council might also want to register the type of school in which the teacher is employed, because it must be remembered the Council will have to prepare the electoral roll under Schedule 1 which provides for the election of the Council after the Council has first been set up. In preparing the electoral roll, the Council might well want the name of the school. It might wish to send the ballot forms to the teacher at the school rather than to the teacher at his home. In the Bill there is no obligation on the Council to publish the register, and it is not expected that the register would be published. It would be an enormous and expensive task to publish the register. So there cannot be any objection on the ground that the Council would be publicising information such as a teacher's date of birth or anything else that it might be undesirable to publish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing which might well be felt by the Council to be a particular which should be entered on the register is marital status. I remind the Committee of the need to make tremendous efforts, as effective efforts as are possible, to recruit married women teachers back into teaching. One of the things we do not have at the moment is any record of existing married women teachers, who are not necessarily at the moment teaching, but, for example, to whom the Secretary of State could write in an effort to persuade them to return to teaching. The assembly of a list of married women teachers for any such purpose as this would be possible only if marital status were one of the particulars, in relation to a woman teacher, included in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the restriction imposed by the Amendment would preclude the Council from including in the register anything elaborate in the way of particulars at all, particulars of the kind I have mentioned and of which I have given examples, which would be of real
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
assistance to the Council in its whole consideration of education, supply and recruitment. Therefore, I suggest to the hon. and learned Gentleman that it is better to keep in
	<br><blockquote><p>"such qualifications and other particulars as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. and learned Friend on this Amendment. We are giving great powers to the Council to seek all sorts of information which it may be it should not have or which it may not be desirable that it should have. The hon. Lady has mentioned three points with which I do not quarrel, as being relevant information, including the type of school and marital status. Why not say that and leave it there? Why should the Council have power to include lots of other things and be a generally nosy-parker type of Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is really a question of the sort of attitude one adopts as to what the Council is going to be. If the hon. Gentleman accepts that it would be reasonable for them to have details of date of birth, address of school, change of address to another school, marital status, then in fact what he is saying is that he is suspicious that the Teaching Council would wish to act in a nosy-parker way and enter into all kinds of, presumably, personal details about teachers. I cannot see that there is any substance in this argument at all. I cannot see that it is reasonable or sensible to assume that the Council would wish to act in this way. It would be a responsible body of people with a great deal too much to do to be interested in probing into the personal qualities of individuals, or in seeking to collect unnecessary information in the register. Since the other particulars would be only those which a reasonable and responsible Council would regard as necessary to have on the register for particular purposes, then surely it is reasonable to keep words in the Clause as they are and not to accept the Amendments on the ground of the kind of suspicion of the Council which the hon. Gentleman has expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we establish the point which the hon. and learned Member raised, whether the individual teacher will have access to what is said about him in the record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes indeed. When we come to a later Amendment it will be made clear that the question of access to the register is relevant and important. There is no reason at all why the register should not be accessible to anyone whose name is inscribed in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely clear as to who is to prescribe the further details which have to be given. It may well be that the Council will have the sole right to determine what particulars should be prescribed. It might be that that interpretation could be taken from what the Under-Secretary of State has said. It could well be that a statutory instrument or regulations will have to be issued to prescribe what particulars have to be given by teachers who seek to keep their names on the register. Whatever may be the case, there are obvious objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, if the Council is to determine which particulars may be prescribed it means that Parliament loses control of the particulars which may be asked. What would be the position if a teacher declined to give particulars prescribed? A difficult situation could arise, and one could envisage circumstances in which individual teachers, for good or for bad reasons, might refuse to give information which the Council thought necessary. If it is necessary to have regulations to prescribe which particulars have to be given it is important that the precise limits which we are prepared to accept should be laid down in the Bill. In other words, could we not define the particulars which we think it would be reasonable to issue regulations upon? Could we not lay down the limits at either end? It is important that this should be done. Therefore, the first point is as to the way in which the particulars will be prescribed, and whether it will be by statutory instrument, or whether the Council will have the right to say which particulars should be prescribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if it is statutory instruments which will lay down—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may wish to note that in subsection (4) it is provided that the word "prescribed" means
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribed by the Council in rules made under this subsection".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
This may avoid my hon. Friend taking up a lot of time discussing something which does not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I want to do is to take up time unnecessarily, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. In those circumstances, having regard to subsection (4), it becomes even more objectionable, because it appears that we are dealing with a Council, and not a statutory instrument, which will declare the needs to be prescribed. In that case it is even more important that we should lay down some limits to the requirements which are likely to be prescribed, that is, as to the limits on what the Council can ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter is that we should establish if there is any obligation to reveal particulars prescribed, and what will be the penalties upon somebody who does not reveal such information as prescribed by the Council. It would be most unfortunate if a situation arose in which somebody was refused the right to register because he or she would not reveal information prescribed. The most important thing we must do in a Bill of this kind, when we are giving powers of this nature, is to define the limits of responsibility, in this case to define the limit of the particulars which are to be prescribed by the Council</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most surprised at the argument adduced by the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on this Clause. Are we here establishing a namby-pamby, fancy or secret society? Or are we giving the right to this Council to be able to select the type of individuals who are to teach in Scotland? It is a simple issue. Most amazing and fantastic arguments have been adduced by the hon. Member in relation to the regulations. Has he forgotten, after only two Sittings of this Committee, that over 20 members of the teaching profession are to sit on this Teaching Council? Are they going to stay in their seats and say nothing at all about some outrageous unnecessary details being given of an individual's career?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supposing, as the hon. Member says, a teacher refuses to answer the questions. The answer is simple. If he refuses to answer questions put to him by a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
responsible body such as this, a body composed, as I have said, of many teachers, if he refuses to give information, then obviously the individual would not be registered. I hope that they will take a firm line on such a matter. It is not going to be some sort of secret society or M.I.5 which is going to probe into some sinister aspect of an individual's life. It will ask for the bare minimum information which is required, which will establish whether the Council is going to be any good at all to the teaching profession in Scotland and to education in Scotland generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Late on the Paper there follows an Amendment by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, which gives some clue to the reason for his being anxious to try to limit this body. It is a political stunt on the part of the hon. Member when he puts down an Amendment of that kind in order to get a few votes in his own constituency. [HON. MEMBERS: "Order, order."] I say that honestly, frankly and sincerely, having read his Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Teaching Council, composed as it will be of 44 members, drawn largely from the teaching profession, can surely be given the simple right and duty to seek information which will be necessary to establish the sort of registration that all of us want to see in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to take up more time in view of what my hon. and learned Friend has said; it appears that we are under some obligation to get through this Bill reasonably quickly. However, I feel I should reply in some way to what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) has said. He related what I said to an Amendment which appears further down on the Paper. While I have no wish to discuss this, it is fair to say that it was the interests of the people referred to in the later Amendment which I had in mind when I made the remarks on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are glad to hear that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to point out that I am particularly concerned that a group of about 40 teachers in Scotland may well be placed in a difficult position if they are forced to give information which their conscience will not allow them to do. There is a real danger that, if we go for-
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
ward and do not lay down specific limits to the information which can be collected, we shall lose the services of some 40 teachers in Scotland. This is a matter which should concern us greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member opposite has said that to some extent this may be a political stunt and that I may be looking for votes in my constituency. I would remind him that, to my knowledge, there are four people in my constituency who are affected by the provisions set out in this Bill. Not only have they a conscientious objection to revealing certain information relating to their personal background, but also because of their religion they refuse to take part in election campaigns or to exercise their right to vote. The Amendment refers to voting in relation to the Teaching Council. The same thing applies to votes in national and local government elections. If the hon. Member thinks that I am looking for votes in my constituency, then I certainly shall not get them from four people who have a conscientious objection to voting at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given the hon. Member a certain amount of latitude to answer that point. I should be glad if he would now come back to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Brewis. But I thought that point should be made. Perhaps the hon. Member may feel disposed to make an apology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we believe that we have a function here to try to protect the individual, to support democracy, it is only right that, when we are giving powers to a certain body, that we should define the ends and limits of those powers. That is all that we are seeking to do by this Amendment. It is dangerous to give general powers which are not capable of direct and precise interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been quite clear throughout discussions on this Bill that we on this side of the Committee are not in any way trying to restrict the powers of the Council. To some extent we have tried to extend them because we feel that the major powers are in some ways limiting and have not given to the Council the powers recommended by the Wheatley Council. However, when one is giving powers they should be laid down precisely. If the action of the Council in regard to certain particulars might involve embarrassment to 40 teachers in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
this country, it would produce a dangerous situation. I pointed out at Second Reading that I doubt if this Bill will produce, either immediately or in the near future, any more teachers. We must be very sure that we do not lose teachers because of the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a slight danger that these people and others of a similar persuasion may feel that they are adversely affected by the actions of the Council, and this is a feeling which we shall have to watch, and cater for. If we do not carefully prescribe the limits, we may cause individual teachers personal embarrassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was alarmed to hear it said that, if teachers did not give the information prescribed, they should be struck off the register and deprived of their livelihoods. That kind of attitude is acutely dangerous in any democratic institution. We are not here to lay down rules which people must follow—"or else"; but to try to help the teaching position in Scotland and to improve the education framework in Scotland. If we adopt the attitude demonstrated by hon. Members opposite, we shall have difficult times. I doubt whether it is right that Scotland's education system should be in the hands of people representative of the opinions which we have heard from hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we can expect the Amendment to be accepted, but I hope that the hon. Lady will find a way of defining the limits to what can be prescribed by the Council and so prevent a serious situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Cullen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that it was essential for the date of birth to be registered for superannuation and similar purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I align myself with at least part of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern). I have quickly reached the conclusion as a new Member of Parliament that much of today's discussion could have been avoided if hon. Members had made an honest appreciation of what they were trying to achieve. The composition of the Council makes it perfectly clear that the teachers will be well represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
There will also be ample representation from local authorities. People representing these august bodies will have sufficient intelligence to know that there are certain questions which must not be asked. Every organisation has a constitution, and those who are not prepared to comply with the requirements of that constitution, cannot become members of the organisation. In this case, the number would be very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that we are trying to take the rôle of dictators, but nothing could be further from the truth. It must also be made clear that we are not prepared to be members of a clandestine organisation. The teachers have organisations strong enough to see that the interests of the teachers are protected. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) has said that certain people in his constituency would take umbrage if certain questions were asked. That is true of my constituency and I have had letters of a kind similar to those mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. On the other side of the coin, others have strongly argued that there must be sufficient vigilance to ensure that potential teachers have the necessary 	<i>bona fides,</i> that they are suitable persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all said that the needs of education are uppermost in our minds, and I am surprised that it should now be suggested that hon. Members on this side of the Committee have some ulterior motive in asking for these questions to be answered. Most of us are members of organisations whose task it is to argue the case of the underdog. I hazard the guess that if hon. Members opposite make an honest appreciation of what the Clause sets out to do, they will agree that it must stand as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Moral uprightness must always be our concern. Without claiming to be an authority on sectarian theology, it is certainly my understanding that the Exclusive Brethren, to whom I imagine this argument to refer, would have no objection to allowing this sort of information to be given. Is the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) quite certain that they do object to this proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to take part in the debate, but a new situation has now developed. Hon. Members opposite are attempting to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
turn the whole purpose and meaning of the Bill upside down. The Bill is in the interest of the teachers, among other things, for it is meant to increase their status. Hon. Members opposite failed to take the opportunity to introduce the Bill earlier, yet they now say that they are trying to protect the interests of the teachers. Yet the teachers are among those who have welcomed the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the teachers' organisations have drawn attention to certain parts of the Bill and have suggested certain changes, no teachers' organisation has complained about this provision. That suggests that the teachers for whom hon. Members opposite claim to speak are perfectly satisfied with this provision and know that it is not an endeavour to set up some kind of police State within teaching and that they agree that there is information of value in addition to names, addresses and qualifications, which should be included on the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the administration is to be undertaken by the Teaching Council—and I reiterate that it is a teaching council and not a teachers' council, for we should not exaggerate the number of teachers involved—we shall have a responsible body in charge. Freedom is guaranteed not just by our deliberations here, but by eternal vigilance, not only by the law, but by the existence of teachers' organisations and people who are ready and able to fight and struggle for liberty. This is the nature of democracy and it is not to be found only in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My one anxiety about which I would like clarification is on the question of publication. What is meant by publication? It would seem perfectly proper for any member of the public to be able to see the register. If I am to attend a doctor to have my stomach examined, I want to know whether he is registered and qualified, and if my child goes to school, I want to know whether he is to be taught by a registered and qualified teacher. Whatever is meant by non-publication, the information should be accessible to everyone concerned, to parents as well as to administrators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should dismiss the attempts of hon. Members opposite to suggest that these provisions are for some obscure police State reasons. We should dismiss the suggestion that the provision is concerned
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
with attacking a small group or sect. The problem of the sect mentioned is connected with voting and not with being registered. Its members register for all sorts of things, including births, deaths and marriages—at least, I hope they do—and so the question does not arise. We should pass the Clause as it stands, remembering that the Bill is in defence of teaching and to increase the status of teaching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to take part in the debate. I approached the Clause with an open mind, but I now believe that there is substance in what has been said, although for rather different reasons. It is vital to know whether this is to be a public or private register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should answer this question immediately. Subsection (4,c) provides for the issue of certain extracts from the register. When I said that it would not be published, I meant that it was unlikely to be printed in quantity, which would be an extremely expensive and difficult business. However, there is no reason why the register should not be accessible to everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has not given the answer I wanted. The medical register, the solicitors' register and others can be consulted by any member of the public. It is desirable that .the teachers' register should be available to local education committees who would require to know qualifications and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to what might or might not be properly contained in the register. Much of the worry about the Clause is concerned with religion. Religion is of the utmost importance in education. In Scotland we have three classes of schools with religious connotations. There are the ordinary schools, which have no particular religious bias and which are presumably the care of the national Church, .the Church of Scotland. We then have a very large group of schools which are the care of the Roman Catholic Church and a small number which are the care of the Episcopalian Church. It seems desirable that a teacher's religious denomination should be entered on the register, at least to the extent of indicating whether he is Roman Catholic, Episcopalian or Church of Scotland. There is some sense in having
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
some note on the register about the teacher's religious persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also essential that we should know the age of a teacher, but we begin to run into great difficulty when we start to consider political persuasion. It would be intolerable to mark on the register whether a teacher was a member of the Unionist Party, the Labour Party, the Communist or any other. In this respect the hon. Lady must decide what particulars she wants. It would be highly undesirable to record the political views of a teacher in any register, public or private.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the state of health of the teacher. The hon. Lady mentioned this at an earlier stage, when she talked about whether a teacher, for reasons of physical health, or possibly mental health, would be fit to teach. Will the register record whether a teacher is suffering from T.B. or, worse still, from V.D.? Will this register record whether the teacher is a homosexual? These are things which the Teaching Council might consider it necessary to record, and if this register is to be a public one, it will be intolerable to record particulars of that kind against any teacher. I think that the hon. Lady must decide whether information of this sort is to go on the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the register show whether a teacher is or is not a teetotaller? A lot of people will be interested in this, and I do not think that it will be desirable to record in a public register whether a teacher takes a drink or not. Does the hon. Lady intend the Teaching Council to have power to require information on that subject? It is not ridiculous to ask whether the register will record whether a teacher is a smoker or a non-smoker. This seems to be a subject on which there may be legitimate curiosity, especially in view of the propaganda being carried out in certain quarters on this subject at the moment. The hon. Lady must tell us whether she thinks that sort of information should be recorded in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, is it to be recorded whether a teacher has a black face or a white one? Here we are up against the difficult problem of racial discrimination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that a teachers' organisation would for a moment allow its members to par-
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
ticipate in drawing up a register in which these questions appeared?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Bill is giving the Council power to do. This Clause puts no limit on the particulars which may be prescribed. Neither the Secretary of State nor anybody else has the right to forbid the Council to call for information of the kind to which I have referred. The only organisation I know of which could alter these particulars, if the Teaching Council decided to ask for them, is Parliament itself, and it seems to me that the time for Parliament to consider this is not at some time in the future when these particulars are called for, but now, when we are giving these powers to the Teaching Council. The hon. Lady must say whether she will empower the Teaching Council to require a teacher to state whether he is a pure European, an African, a Pakistani, or whatever he may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. That is just where the hon. Gentleman is mistaken. I have a whole series of Amendments dealing with whether the Teaching Council shall be professional. We are setting up a Council which, on the face of it, will have a majority of teachers, but it does not mean that it will necessarily the representative of the teaching profession. Some of the teaching representatives on the Council may not be present when it is decided to call for these details. The Secretary of State is to nominate six people to the Council. Local authorities are to nominate a certain number. Thus, it may not be the teaching profession which is calling for this information, but a lot of local councillors and people of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we are entitled to know what information the Teaching Council will call for. I put it quite bluntly. Will the Council record whether a man has a black face or a white one? If it does, this will mean racial discrimination, and I would not be prepared to give this Council or any other organisation the right to introduce racial discrimination of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it go into the kind of detail to which the hon. Gentleman has referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the Law Society has no statutory power to call for information of that kind. In this case, however, Parliament is considering giving the Council dictatorial powers to ask a teacher to state whether he has a black face or a white one.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman uses the phrase "giving powers" to a whole lot of local councillors. Is not this a reflection of the scorn that he has for local democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely answering the hon.

I am pointing out that the teaching profession will not be laying down the rules. The Council will consist of representatives of the teaching profession, and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is an even more serious danger here. Will this register record confidential reports made about a teacher by Her Majesty's Inspectors, or by headmasters? It would be intolerable if it contained such information. Will if show the trade union of which the teacher is a member? Will it state whether he is a member of the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association, or the Secondary Teachers' Association, or the E.I.S.? An education authority may have a prejudice against a teacher who is a member of the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association. I know that certain local authorities have such a prejudice. Is this sort of information to be recorded?

There are serious dangers in this proposal, and I implore the hon. Lady to give the matter a good deal of thought.

	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
I am not asking her to answer the point now. I am asking her to think about this and to set out in the Bill plainly for everybody to see the particulars which she wants recorded in this register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sense of humour displayed by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is something which I have never suspected. If this register is made public and the questions posed by the hon. Gentleman are answered, it will be a best seller. He has, however, left out one or two details. Perhaps the register should contain two photographs of the teacher, one full face, and one in profile. Perhaps it should contain the teachers' fingerprints, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill gives the Council power to require even that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman overlooked one or two fundamental things. Perhaps the register should contain information about whether a teacher is suffering from hallux valgus or pimples. There will be pages and pages of the most intimate details of a teacher's life story, and I would not sell such a register for less than 30s. a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the essential features of the establishment of the Council is the creation of this register. It will show that the teaching profession regards itself as sufficiently responsible to rule its own profession, but when I listen to the arguments advanced by hon. Gentlemen opposite about what is likely to happen when these questions are asked, I become more and more bewildered and amazed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) expects a whole string of difficulties. He goes to the extreme and says that if a member of the teaching profession refuses to answer a simple question he should have the right to opt out of answering it. That is the logic of his argument. The result would be that out of 37,000 teachers in Scotland we might be able to get one answer to ten questions, or to three questions, from each member of the profession. The hon. Gentleman says that teachers should have the right to decide whether they will answer any particular questions. Would not it be far more honest to say that we should scrap the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
register? How can we establish a register, which is created by responsible people, and then allow people to refuse to answer certain questions? He says that we should not prevent them from earning their livelihood because they refuse to answer simple straightforward and relevant questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan). I think that there will be a majority of teachers on the Council. Whether at the point at which they are elected they are actually engaged in teaching does not arise. They will at some point in their careers have been teachers, and will therefore appreciate the information which the register should contain. Surely nobody would be prepared to say that a Council composed of 25 teachers, or erstwhile teachers, would ask questions which were riot strictly relevant to the creation of a reasonable and reliable register whose main and overriding purpose was to establish that the individual had qualifications in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Council itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is as simple as that. It is not a Council of heathens and anarchists. The Council will consist of people who have had some experience of life. They will know the questions which they would like to ask, and those to which they would respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart spoke about a sect in which are 40 teachers. I have heard from spokesmen on behalf of this group. They do not say that they will refuse to give relevant information to get their names on a register. They assure me that they will have no objection to the creation of a register, and that they will be prepared to give reasonable and relevant information. Whether they will be allowed to vote for the people who serve on the Council is a different matter, and I do not want to go into something which is not relevant, but, when we are talking about 40 teachers, and talking in terms of their electoral interests, we must remember that we are talking not merely of 40 teachers in Scotland, but of many more people who belong to this body, and I am certain that they will be prepared to subscribe to the register and provide the information required by the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like an answer from the Minister to the various points put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), some of which I admit were humorous. We are giving the Council great powers, and it could conceivably turn into some kind of Soviet. We should consider the question in the light of liberty, and should not cause people to have to fill up forms and give information which they may not wish to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a straight answer to this question: if a teacher refuses to answer some of the questions asked of him what will happen to him? Will his licence be taken away? Will he be dismissed, as seems to be indicated by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has said. The merits of the Amendment have not yet been discussed. But the hon. Member went on to ask questions which themselves were outside the terms of the Amendment. That was why I raised my point of order. It seems to me that discussion of a later Amendment is not relevant to this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause relates to paragraph 120 of the Wheatley Report, concerning the registration of teachers. The Report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have already pointed out that one of the main features of some other professions is their system of registration, under which the licence or right to practise as a qualified member of the profession is dependent on admission to, and continued appearance in, a register maintained by the professional body".</p></blockquote>
After hearing his speech this morning we may wonder how the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) obtained a licence to practise law. The Amendments seek to delete the word "such" and certain words which follow. If the debate had ended with the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) the Committee would have been better served. The Clause, in subsection 	<i>(4,e)</i> provides that the rules which are to be prescribed shall be prescribed by the Council itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is to provide a sense of self-government to the Council and to give
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
it confidence in dealing with the question of licensing or registration of teachers. Who is better equipped to lay down those standards? I should have thought there was much to be said for the teachers themselves having the power. Under the provisions of subsection (4) the Council
	<br><blockquote><p>"may make rules with respect to the form and keeping of the register, and the making of entries and alterations therein".</p></blockquote>
That is a desirable thing. Is it likely to encourage the teachers to assist the Secretary of State in setting standards and laying down qualifications concerning those who are entitled to be registered? Let the Council make its own rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that in the case of such professional people as solicitors and doctors it was suggested in the beginning that in order to protect the public their representative organisations should lay down certain standards. All that we are asking is that this should be done in the case of teachers. Just as the parents of a child may express some concern about a dentist's qualifications, we should show some sense of urgency about the qualifications of teachers in the classroom. If we did that we should get somewhere in education. I hope that my hon. Friend will not move from the position she has adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been entertained if not assisted by the speech of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). I am sure that he will not expect me to take most of his argument very seriously. He enjoyed himself. If, by any chance, he does expect me to take him seriously I can perhaps best illustrate the absurdity of his remarks by reference to another Act which was introduced by his party in the last Government, namely, the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act, 1960, which, among other things, sets up boards similar to the Teaching Council to control the entry to the various professions supplementary to medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Measure was brought in by the hon. Member's party, and it may be of interest to him to know that in outlining the duties of each board that Act provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of each board to prepare and maintain a register of the names, addresses and qualifications, and such other particulars as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
In other words we are following exactly the example set by his Government in these matters. We accept the view that when we are setting up a board which is given a certain degree of self-government—a matter on which he feels very strongly—and in this case, where we are setting up a Council of this kind, it should have overwhelming responsibility to decide how its register shall be kept. In this case, of a body which is assuming new and hitherto unforeseen dictatorial powers, he must go back to what his own party said and his own Government did five years ago in another Measure of a similar kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that previous legislation escaped my vigilance does not the hon. Lady agree that two wrongs do not make a right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends who is giving the definition of what is wrong. This morning the hon. Member's definitions have been a little wide of the mark, and I am inclined not to take them too seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) will find that some of the matters about which he expressed concern can be discussed more fully when we reach his later Amendment to the Schedule. It would not be right for me to go into the general question of conscience at this stage. Objections of conscience are more relevant to registration itself than to the giving of particulars which are asked for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) asked what would happen to a teacher who did not wish to give particulars. This is a matter on which we are giving the Council responsibility for making its own rules. These rules will, no doubt, cover points of that kind. If we are not prepared to trust the Council—with the degree of responsibility which we are giving it—to make sensible rules in this regard we may as well come out into the open and say that we do not think that the Council is a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His other point concerned a general question of principle. I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Member and by everybody else; it is the duty of every hon. Member to be concerned at all times to protect the liberty of the subject. But there is a contradiction here. If we are seeking to enlarge the view of democracy—which is what the Bill does
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
to some degree—and if we are making the teaching profession responsible for running its own affairs, we must delegate to the Council the responsibility for protecting the liberty of the teachers. This is inescapable. We believe that the Council as constituted can be trusted to exercise a proper concern for liberty. If we did not think that that would be the case we would not be proposing to set up this sort of Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very unlikely that the Council would wish to ask for any information which people did not already give when entering colleges of education. Hon. Members opposite who have expressed concern on the matter need be in no doubt that it would certainly be an understanding of the Government that the rules which the Council would make governing the compiling of this register would be eminently sensible rules, which paid due regard to the need to protect the liberty and freedom of the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her answer to my question, but what does she think the Council will do if a teacher refuses to answer? That is what I am concerned with, and that is where liberty is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it is, but I am sure that the hon. Member will agree that it is no use giving responsibilities and powers to a body and then laying down precisely what we hope will be its interpretation of its powers and responsibilities. To do that would be to make a nonsense of giving it those responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question arose from the misunderstanding of the function of the register. This will not be a sort of employment bureau register; it will be a register for those people who are entering the teaching profession and who have been allowed to become members of it. There is no reason to suppose that it will contain details which an employer would wish to have in respect of his employees. It is not that kind of register. That clearly emerges if we compare the provisions of the Bill with the Wheatley Report. Reports of Her Majesty's Inspectors on teachers would not be included in the register. Such information is not even made available to other teachers. It is available only inside the Scottish Education Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
The register follows the pattern of the registers which are kept by other professional bodies. The councils or boards of other professions are given responsibility for exercising their duties with a degree of self-government, and that is what we intend here. With that explanation I hope that we can move on to a discussion of the later parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 32, to leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a number of points about the Bill which I have found difficult to understand, but this subsection (3) is one matter on which I find no difficulty. I cannot see anything in subsection (2) which gives rise to the need for an avoidance of doubt provision in subsection (3). Subsection (2) sets out a series of qualifications for registration. First, the person must be a certificated teacher. Secondly, he must have fulfilled the requirements prescribed under Clause 7. Thirdly
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a person who is not entitled to be registered under either of the two foregoing paragraphs, his education, training, fitness to teach and experience"</p></blockquote>
must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"such as, in the opinion of the Council, to warrant his registration".</p></blockquote>
Then paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> provides that a person who has
	<br><blockquote><p>"been a certificated teacher whose certificate has been withdrawn or suspended, and not restored under any enactment in force before the commencement of this Act"</p></blockquote>
shall be entitled to be registered if
	<br><blockquote><p>"his registration has been directed by the Disciplinary Committee under paragraph 	<i>(d)</i> of section 10(3) of this Act or, in a case not falling under that paragraph, by the Council".</p></blockquote>
Then there is a proviso with regard to Clause 10(2,fc) and Clause 11(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite clear that those are the circumstances in which
	<br><blockquote><p>"a certificated teacher whose certificate has been withdrawn or suspended, and not restored under any enactment in force before the commencement of this Act"</p></blockquote>
is entitled to be registered. Subsection (3) merely repeats something which is perfectly obvious:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that a person shall not be entitled to be registered by virtue of paragraph (c) of the last foregoing subsection if he has been a certificated teacher and his certificate has
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
been withdrawn or suspended, and not restored under any enactment in force before the commencement of this Act."</p></blockquote>
Indeed, it almost quotes the earlier provision in subsection 	<i>(2,d).</i> There is no need for an avoidance of doubt provision here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can help the hon. and learned Gentleman. I am a little surprised at his concern, because I should have thought that he would have welcomed a removal of doubt provision, in view of his earlier remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has overlooked the point that a former certificated teacher could regard himself as a person, in the words of subsection (2,c), whose
	<br><blockquote><p>"education, training, fitness to teach and experience"</p></blockquote>
were such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"to warrant his registration".</p></blockquote>
This is the difficulty. In other words, he might present himself as a candidate for exceptional admission to the register. This is not a strong possibility. Even if he did so present himself, he would presumably be rejected by the Committee for exceptional admission. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to eliminate this possibility and not to allow any doubt to creep in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the number of former certificated teachers applying for registration will never be great. Only a small number of people is involved. It is desirable that we should ensure that such cases be dealt with either by the Disciplinary Committee or by the Council itself, whichever seems appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment were accepted, a loophole would be left open. We do not like to leave loopholes. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that there is a very tiny loophole here and that to remove doubt we need the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be the last to suggest that if there is a tiny loophole it should be left open. I agree that in such circumstances there must be an avoidance of doubt provision. It is clear that the registration of

	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Rules under this section shall be published in such manner as the Council may determine and shall come into force on a date not less than one month from the date on which they are so published.</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 47, after "fees" to insert "not exceeding £1".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we have discussed the register at great length. I want briefly to concern myself with how much it might cost to have one's name entered in the register. Paragraphs 7-9 of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum mention, amongst other things, that the expenses of the Council will be met for the most part by fees. This is amplified in Clause 15. However, there is no hint anywhere in the Bill about what the fee should be. It might be worth a few minutes of the Committee's time to consider this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my intention that we should tie a responsible Council like this in its financial arrangements. On the other hand, I do not think that we want to see it either extravagant or too expansive and having to charge fees in excess of what we might think desirable. Taking £1 as the outside figure and considering the number of certificated teachers, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
have in round figures £40,000. Then there are those who have retired but who might wish, for reasons of pride, to be registered. There would be, to begin with, a nest egg of £40,000 plus. This would certainly allow the Council to repay to the Secretary of State the £10,000 which he is allowing as a loan for the Council to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is a big yearly intake of teachers. This is particularly true of the women teachers who have joined the profession and who, for reasons of marriage, and so on, have left. This is somewhat hidden in the figures, in that whilst the net gain of women teachers may be only 3,000 or 4,000 since 1951, there have been about 18,000 teachers who would have been registered had the Council been in being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there could be a very large income for the Council if the fee were as high as £1. I earnestly hope that the fee will be less. That is why I put it at the high figure of £1, to initiate a brief discussion to discover the Government's mind. It must be remembered that at the time when the teacher will seek to become registered his means are at their most limited. Therefore, we should be as helpful as possible in keeping the fee as low as possible, as the Council will think fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the desire of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) should have an explanation on this. However, it is clear that he does not mean to argue the case for bringing the provisions which are at present in the Schedule into the Bill. It is a rather separate argument that those matters that derive from a Clause in a Bill should be contained in a Schedule rather than in the Bill itself. As I understand it from the argument, the hon. Gentleman does not necessarily argue this point very strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I shall consider merely the question of the fee, the registration and the arrangements there will be. What the Bill does at the moment is to give discretion to the Council to determine what seems to it to be a reasonable fee and the way in which the fee would be paid, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. In other words, the residual power is with the Secretary of State to say yea or nay to the arrangements the Council proposes in this regard. It seemed to me that perhaps the

	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
hon. Gentleman was envisaging necessarily an annual fee. Perhaps he will tell me whether he has this firmly in his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I had not envisaged an anual fee. I took it that there would be a once-for-all fee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seemed to be thinking in terms of an annual fee. It would be rather important that the Council had the freedom to consider whether it had a once-for-all fee—that is, whether it had a long-term or life registration—or whether it had periodic payments of a fee. The amount would be determined by whatever arrangements the Council was making in terms of the length of time the fee covered. It is fairly clear that to try to limit the registration fee to a maximum of £1 would be limiting the Council's discretion unnecessarily, since, again, the Secretary of State's approval is required for whatever way the Council suggests of dealing with this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other change of substance which would follow from the Amendment would be for the proviso to disappear that different fees might be charged in different classes of case. The first of the changes limiting the registration fee is something best left to the Council. There is no reason to suppose that the registration fee will be anything other than modest. The second one is again open to the objection that we want to be able to give the Council freedom to decide the length of the term of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need to consider giving discretion to the Council in this matter is linked to some extent with the Council's possible wish to consider slightly separately the position of entrants to the profession who are coming on to the register as they come out of the colleges
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
of education and of those who are already in the profession. The Council might want to consider these classes separately in order not to have the initial expenses of the Council bearing too heavily on those already in the profession. One wishes to give the Council freedom and discretion as to how it will arrange these matters, subject always to the Secretary of State's approval. The hon. Gentleman can be happy in the knowledge that the Secretary of State has the power to look at the arrangements which the Council makes in this regard and say whether he thinks them sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal with the Amendments in page, 3, line 49, and page 4, line 11. The purpose of these Amendments will be perfectly clear. The hon. Lady referred to them in passing. It is not desirable, if it can be avoided, to have to read a Section of an Act of Parliament with reference to a Schedule at the end. In these days, Acts of Parliament are difficult enough to understand in themselves, without having to split one's attention from a Section at the beginning to a Schedule at the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the wording is perfect in either case; no doubt it could be improved; but the purpose of the two Amendments is to combine the provisions in the Schedule with those in the Clause. Unless the hon. Lady has some very good reason why it should not be done, it seems to me to be more in accordance with practice and drafting, and with our desire to simplify legislation so far as possible, that it should be done, and I hope</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
