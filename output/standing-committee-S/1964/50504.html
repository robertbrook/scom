	<div class='title'>Clause 5.—(ERECTION OF BUILDINGS AND PROVISION OF SERVICES ETC.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [29th April],</i> In page 3, line 32, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"assist, promote, or undertake the planting and maintenance of shelter belts."—	<i>[Mr. Malcolm MacMillan.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt on Thursday with the Amendment and I made the point that, although I sympathised with the proposal behind it, I did not think that it was a good plan that the Board should be the actual undertakers of the planting of trees, which should be left to be arranged by the Forestry Commission. I have similar objections to Amendment No. 97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having visited these areas myself I would find it difficult to describe the impact made upon me. Some of the most magnificent steps have been taken in agricultural development, ranking with others which have perhaps been more publicised. There has also been an enormous psychological advantage to the communities in those places. Very little can be more satisfying to a man's emotions than to make new and really good use of land which has been idle. What is more, as the population grows it is up against not only the social advantages of such schemes but sheer economic necessity, as time moves on, such as the reseeding and regeneration of this land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not jobs for the Board to do, in managing and maintaining all this regenerated land. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) expressed the view that the grants did not continue for long enough and that another year of them would make all the difference. In that case, the answer is to extend the grants, but to let
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
the crofters, rather than the Board, do this job of management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not disagree with the hon. Gentleman, and I had my own doubts about handing the whole job over to the Board, and these Amendments are to encourage the furtherance of schemes of this nature, and it is obvious that the Board must assist in the furthering of these schemes since nobody else is doing them. How would the hon. Gentleman deal with the problem of marketing better quality stock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point which the hon. Gentleman made, and with which I have not yet dealt. It is important to avoid getting the lines crossed in this matter. Marketing of livestock should not be a matter for the Board, but perhaps the transport of it might be. Surely marketing is a job for the new livestock marketing authority, which I understand the Minister of Agriculture is on the point of bringing forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may now turn to Amendment No. 99 which deals with marine works. I am very much more inclined to agree that the Board should either take over, or at least have a very big say, in this field. The only thing worth noting in passing is that "marine works" has a very narrow definition. I doubt whether the instances mentioned by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) come into the definition, either in the Harbours, Piers and Ferries Act, 1937, or the Harbours Act of a few years ago. Perhaps a way could be found, although I do not think it would be easy, of taking marine work out of the joint responsibility of the Scottish Office and the local authorities, and that would be a very good thing indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If marine work could be constructed out of paper there would have been a vast number built out of the letters and correspondence which I saw even in my comparatively short period at the Scottish Office. There was a vast amount of correspondence about the jetty at the northern end of Barra. If I remember the details aright, in 1957 the local authority drew up plans and submitted them to the Scottish Office, which did not like them, and sent them back, asking the local authority to amend them. The Scottish Office finally drew its own plan, which the local authority did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
quite like. In 1963, when the hon. Member for the Western Isles wrote to me about this matter, I discovered that we had then gone back to square one, the original 1957 proposals of the local authority. The only difference was that in the meantime the costs had gone up considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How did the hon. Gentleman assess his personal responsibility for the return to square one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reluctantly did I say we had returned to square one, but I did my best to break out of square one again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was really doing his very best at the moment when he left office. Let us put it that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that we leave square one and get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would cite one other example, which is of a pier which I visited at Berueray in the constituency of the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles. There, a pier was extended into deeper water, but lobsters can still only be landed at certain states of the tide. It is very easy to be wise after the event. Perhaps no one foresaw the boom that was to take place in shell-fishing. It is a great pity that the job was not done properly to give really full advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have been saying shows the price which has to be paid for dual responsibility. If the bodies concerned could agree, this is a tremendously good field in which the Board might take responsibility for such things as efficient transport, which is essential to the Highlands, and even more to the Lowlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the speeches that the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolmn MacMillan) covers very important matters of wide concern. No one questions the desirability of widespread development of shelter belts to benefit livestock and crops in exposed areas and to contribute to the amenities of the area. Again, no one questions the desirability of getting the best possible system of communication, including piers
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
and jetties, to benefit the coastal areas of the Highlands. No one would question the importance of the regeneration of considerable areas of rough moorland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say, without reserve, that these operations and activities will be within the power of the Highlands Development Board which will assist in their operation or undertake operations, where necessary. The Board will not supersede or override statutory or other bodies which have the power, ability and willingness to carry out these developments, but it will be able to review the position and to submit specific proposals for developments or improvements in existing facilities. If necessary, the Board will be able effectively to fill in gaps in present arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About the delays, one of the objectives in establishing the Board is to secure effective co-ordination in the preparation of suitable proposals and to shorten the whole process of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with shelter belts there are inducements in existing schemes of grants for the planting of shelter belts. In particular, grants of 50 per cent. are available under the Crofters' Agricultural Grants Scheme and of 33⅓ per cent. under the Farm Improvement Scheme. In addition, small woodland grants are given, through the Forestry Commission, at £22 4s. per acre, for quite small areas of shelter planting. Finally, the Forestry Commission has made available to crofters in the Outer Isles small trees, surplus to its requirements, for planting either for amenity or shelter purposes. These have been given free of charge. I mention these facilities because there is a growing consciousness among crofters of the advantages of tree planting on their grazings, whether in small shelter belts of blocks or on a more extensive scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission has, in the past, regarded the exposed areas of the Outer Isles as rather unpromising material for forestry. But the Commission has carried out a good deal of experimental work in recent years on exposed areas and ground of poorer quality. It is now able to consider the planting of land which hitherto would have been ruled out. It has recently been taking a fresh look at the possibility of planting in areas like the Outer Isles. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
hope something useful will emerge from this review. The provision of advice is no less important, and the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) emphasised this point. The Forestry Commission is always ready to give guidance on tree planting within the limits of its facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On small shelter belt planting, the services of the Agricultural College Advisory Service is freely available. The hon. Member for Bute asked if it would be possible for the Board to use the Forestry Commission or private owners in carrying out planting operations. This would be entirely within the power of the Board, although when it came to a substantial forestry scheme one would normally expect the Forestry Commission to undertake the task as part of its normal planting operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to a number of specific projects which he used to illustrate the difficulties and delays involved in the present set-up. With regard to the jetty at Eoligarry, there has been a long history of difference of views as to the siting, the nature of construction and so on and, of course, the relative costs involved. In the circumstances it was decided that the Highland Transport Board should have an opportunity to consider and express views about the project. I would hope a final decision will not be unduly delayed. It is true, as my hon. Friend said, that it is possible to give assistance for marine works forming an essential part of a ferry service under the Highland and Islands Shipping Act, 1960. I think the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) made this point. The improvement of the pier at Tarbert for use by the new ferry service is an example of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised the question of ferry service and the jetty for the island of Vatersay. I am aware of my hon. Friend's concern. So far as the ferry service is concerned, the Secretary of State has not yet received any proposals from the local authority for the introduction of such a service. The construction of the jetty was approved in principle and an offer of a grant made to the county council in October, 1963. The proposed site of the jetty has been selected after exhaustive local consultation and with full consideration of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
overall benefit of the jetty to all users, and the submission of tenders for the construction of the jetty by the county council is awaited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tracing of owners of piers is not easy where the owners have disappeared. The problem is not insuperable, since there are procedures for the service of formal notices under various Statutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of marine work generally, I would assure my hon. Friend that these are matters which the Highland Development Board will have power and a duty under Clause 3 to keep under review. I would hope they will not hesitate to come forward with proposals where they find changes and improvements necessary for the economic and social development of the areas concerned. In this they will have the advantage of the study which the Highland Transport Board are making of the whole problem of transport in the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to regeneration, my hon. Friend had in mind the operations of reclamation and regeneration which I understand have different technical connotation in the Crofters Agricultural Grant Scheme. The Government attach considerable importance to the whole question of land improvement in the Highlands and Islands. As my right hon. Friend announced when introducing the Bill on Second Reading, it has been decided to increase the maximum of the first year grant for regeneration from £11 per acre to £15 per acre. In making this change we had very much in mind the effects of the Agriculture Lime Scheme, 1964, on moorland regeneration projects which in some cases involve the haulage of shell sand over considerable distances. The Agriculture Lime Scheme, 1964, is, as promised when it was brought into operation, being reviewed in the light of the year's experience, but we did feel that we ought not to await the outcome of this before making appropriate adjustments under the Crofters' Grant Scheme. Changes under the Crofters' Grant Scheme do not form part of the annual Farm Price Review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of assistance towards the maintenance of regenerated areas after the first two years is a matter to which a good deal of thought has been given by the Crofters Commission and my Department. One of the main difficulties
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
is that the amount, kind, and incidence of the maintenance required after the first two years can vary considerably depending on the nature of the soil and other conditions of the land. In some cases the main weight of subsequent maintenance might fall not in the third year but the fourth, fifth or even sixth years. It would be extremely difficult to devise a scheme which would fit such widely different circumstances and needs. Essentially, therefore, the present regeneration grants are directed towards initial and second year capital operations on the basis that subsequent maintenance should be a matter of ordinary husbandry. It has not been found possible to devise arrangements which would meet the wishes of the crofters. I am afraid I could not now promise further assistance, but if my hon. Friend or the Crofters Union have any suggestions to make I can assure them that they will be carefully considered by my Department and the Crofters' Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question of larger schemes of reclamation, it is envisaged that this is a matter to which the Highland Development Board will give some attention. The recent Report of the Highland Panel on Land Use in the Highlands and Islands makes a number of recommendations which will be of special interest to the Board. In particular, they recommend the need for group reclamation schemes. In addition the Panel has recommended in the first place that two substantial schemes of reclamation should be undertaken; such schemes could, however, form part of a wider development project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) asked whether surveys were being made. There is, I understand, quite an accumulation of available information in the Departments, in the hands of the Highland Panel, the Peat Committee and the Crofters Commission and so on, all of which could be used for this purpose. At the present time certain surveys are being conducted in various parts of the Highlands in connection with this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) raised three points to which I would like to give specific
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
answers. The first was whether there was power to take over an estate and operate it as an integrated agricultural forestry enterprise. The answer is definitely, Yes. As to how it would carry out the undertaking, this would be a matter for it to decide. It could do it using its own staff, or could have the work carried out by private contractors, or could make arrangements with the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His second question concerned the Board's powers to undertake marine works beyond the limit of low tide. I am advised the Board could carry out such works under the Bill subject to the statutory requirements affecting navigation and that kind of thing. So the answer is "Yes" to both questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly the hon. Member referred to a letter which he has kindly sent me from the Landowners' Federation and which he said gave the impression that at the meeting which I had with representatives of the Federation I indicated that the Board would not be involved in any extensive reclamation schemes. I think there must be some misunderstanding since I have no recollection of having given an undertaking or an assurance of that kind. Nor does the note made by my officials of the proceedings record anything of this sort. I have now read, thanks to the hon. Member, what in fact the Scottish landowners say in their letter or notes. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister of State seemed to be fully aware of the necessity for proceeding cautiously and not attempting ambitious schemes and indicated that initially only pilot schemes would be carried out."</p></blockquote>
I might well have said that one would imagine that the Board would proceed as the Highland Panel had suggested with one or two schemes. I gave no indication that the Board would not undertake reclamation schemes as part of its work. In any case it is not for me to say what the Board will do. The Board will decide that for itself. One would imagine that the Board would try to proceed and to build up, and not engage in all sorts of things which would prove to be spectacular failures, which would be disastrous for the Board. I should have thought it would build up on experience till it became pretty competent at this kind of thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not, obviously, opposing caution. Obviously, one would necessarily proceed with caution. It was merely the tenor of the report which worried me. It seemed to indicate that caution was going to be the byword, that caution was to be the pattern. I am glad to hear the Minister of State saying that, although, naturally, one proceeds with caution, one will proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, definitely, although I cannot say what the Board will do. The Board decides for itself what it will undertake, makes recommendations and so on. One would imagine that a group of men would act in that way. They would have the recommendations of the Highland Development Panel, about reclamation which I would have thought were the kind of recommendations to proceed with before undertaking ambitious schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister at the moment making the sort of point we have been trying to make all along and which he has been denying, which is that, in our view, the Board will not have responsibility for proposing extensive failures because in every single case right down to the smallest one it has to get the approval of the Secretary of State? So long as that remains, the Board will turn round and say the Secretary of State approved whatever action it wanted to take, and it is not the Board's responsibility, it is the Secretary of State's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is the initiative with the Board to prepare proposals and place them before the Secretary of State. Clearly, if the proposals make sense the Secretary of State will approve them and they will go ahead. The initiative rests with the Board. All I am trying to indicate is the manner in which I would expect the Board to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that all these powers are already in the hands of the Board without the acceptance of these Amendments. By specifying these things we do once again raise the point whether certain other aspects are to be included in the powers of the Board. We would have to consider putting things in like factory buildings, servicing, hotels, agricultural buildings, service equipment, roads, tourist information centres, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
all sorts of other things. We think it is better not to put in the words suggested in the three Amendments. I hope that, with this explanation, that my hon. Friend will consider withdrawing the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment deals partly with forestry, partly with land usage. My hon. Friend for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) referred in his speech last Thursday to shelter belts being put up at Glenlivet. I thought it might be of interest to the Committee, the Minister and finally the Board to hear about these experiments, which have been most successful. Shelter belts put up there have been worked out as a joint scheme with the owner-occupier farmers, tenant farmers, landowners and the Forestry Commission. The scale of operation is such that no fewer than 200 farms and crofts have been affected by this scheme, varying in size from ten acres to 10,000 acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pay tribute to those concerned, and especially to the co-operation between the owners and the Forestry Commission. These projects cover just over 8,200 acres, in a comparatively small area. I suggest that projects of that nature, on an increased scale, would be of tremendous benefit to agriculture in the Highlands. No fewer than 4,000 of those acres have been planted in the last 10 years. During that period it has become apparent that at lambing time sheep take advantage of the shelter belts to shelter from the prevailing wind. As the trees grow, the shelter will improve. I am told that as a result of planting these shelter belts we shall not only provide shelter for the sheep but we shall improve the natural grazing in the vicinity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A scheme such as that which I have described has numerous advantages. Primarily it brings together the interested parties—farmers, landowners and the Forestry Commission. The planning is meticulous. The area is first allocated and then surveyed, and eventually the Commission plants the trees. As a result of this—in some cases advantage having been taken of previous planting—roads have been constructed by the Commission leading past these large areas of trees to the existing forests. That, in itself, is a tremendous advantage, because it means that farmers and crofters who, in the past,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
because of bad conditions, have been unable to get to the higher knolls of ground, have been able to cultivate those areas and so increase their stockholding capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The larger blocks to which I have referred of necessity from the main operation. I suggest that when the Board gets down to work it might persuade the Commission to think of blocks of less than 50 acres, which is the present minimum for planting. I suggest that blocks as small as 15 acres should be considered. In one case I know of—it is not in the Highlands, but it is in Scotland—a whole area has been ringed with smaller blocks. That is not entirely the work of the Forestry Commission; it is due to the Farm Improvements Scheme and to other schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fencing is necessary to protect trees in their younger stage from depredation by vermin, and also to keep stock away from them later on. A short time ago I planted three or four acres and inadvertently allowed sheep to get in among them when the trees were five or six years old. A great deal of damage was done, not because of rubbing or eating but from the excreta of the sheep. I am told that it is extraordinarily potent, and does great damage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes good manure if it is properly diluted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the right place, yes. My point is that the mere fact that areas are being fenced off for shelter belts is an added advantage to farmers in that sort of area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another long-term result which may well come from such schemes as this is the retention of water in the catchment areas. The person to whom I spoke in connection with this matter told me that purer water may be produced from the planting of trees. Evidently the Scots pine is an extremely prolific grower, and it does something to the water which makes it much more palatable both for human consumption and, as a byproduct, for cattle.

Another point to bear in mind is the possible extension of distilleries—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The problem of drainage has already been referred to. If we cut down the runoff I am sure that we shall be able to conserve the water which is necessary for other purposes. It will save a certain amount of erosion, and prevent the drying up of bogs. A scheme such as that which I have outlined, if operated on a large scale in the Highlands, could make a tremendous difference in land utilisation. Not only would it help the farmers; it would produce work for the foresters and be of vast benefit to the whole area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not able to be present at last Thursday's meeting so as to hear the speech of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). I have, however, read every word he said, and have done so with great interest, and I thought he spoke a surprising amount of good sense, especially on the subject of shelter belts, about which I want to say a few words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, one of the greatest obstacles to the production of shelter belts in greater numbers throughout Scotland has been the strong antagonism of the farming community towards trees. My hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) made some interesting remarks about the Glenlivet scheme. It shows that we can harmonise the interests of farming and forestry to the advantage of both. This scheme should be well advertised throughout the Highlands as an example of what can be done. If farmers, crofters and shepherds in the Highlands could see what is going on there they would be much more in favour of co-operating in the production of trees, shelter belts, woods and plantations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply a question of who should have power to do the work. The Amendment may be a little ambitious in providing that the Board should have the power. The Minister is correct in saying that the natural medium for the implementation of this work is the Forestry Commission. Nevertheless, I am surprised that so far the Commission has been the only body suggested as suitable to do the work. No reference has been made to the possible contribution of private enterprise. We have to remember the interests of the poor old taxpayer,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
because, without any shadow of doubt, he would derive advantage from the encouragement of private enterprise to carry out much of this planting, especially when we remember that the Commission is not often keen to plant areas of less than 50 acres. Private owners could do this as part of their normal estate management operations. It has been done successfully in many other parts of Scotland and it should be encouraged further north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of encouragement is necessary to persuade private owners to do this work? Some people believe that the threat of having their land taken from them and planted by the Commission is a sufficient incentive for the owners to get on with the job themselves. If that is the effect, I shall not be sorry to see this threat being used, but what is wanted in the private sector more than anything else is long-term confidence. It is in that respect that I believe that the lunatic fringe of the Labour Party, which yells day after day for confiscation, nationalisation and the take over of land by the State, does an immense amount of harm. Nobody is going to tie up his life's savings in something which will be taken away from him halfway towards the maturing of his crop. It may take a hundred years for these plantations to become profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One good example of what can be done in crofting is contained in the April edition of "Scottish Forestry". It has a very good article pointing out that not only is there the Skye Union Plan for the encouragement of woods on crofting common grazing land but the specific example of a laird—I do not know his name—who, before the Skye Union plan came into being, negotiated with the Forestry Commission over the sale of a piece of land. The bargain made with the crofters was that a certain portion of the money produced by the sale of this land should be put into a fund for the development of crops. The money would go into a fund to which Government grants would be added for the implementation of worthwhile Government schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this way it has been shown possible to encourage the crofters to co-operate in the development of certain areas of land for tree growing. I am told that no less than 100,000 acres of crofters' common grazing land could be planted,
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
although I am sure that if anybody were to suggest that all those acres should be planted now there would be an absolute outcry. Nevertheless, the Glenlivet scheme provides a useful indication of what can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put a question to the Minister in connection with the provision of services as provided for by Amendment No. 99. Is not there more scope for the use of hydrofoil craft, operating between the islands? I am not sure how the experimental craft which is being used in the north of Scotland is getting on; we have not heard much about it. I am not sure whether it is of the same type as that which I have seen operating in other parts of the country with remarkable success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Amendment deals with services in connection with marine works, and not communication between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am out of order, Mr. Steele, I shall take the matter no further, but presumably the question of communication is closely connected with marine works. It is no use having marine works unless there is something which arrives at them, or leaves from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is room for private enterprise to operate, especially in relation to forestry. Private enterprise can often provide a cheaper way of getting on with the job of producing trees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on a point raised by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) regarding the provision of shelter belts. The discussion has centred entirely on the question of physical assistance for the provision of these belts. I think that underlying the remarks of the hon. Member for the Western Isles there is the need for research to develop and evaluate the real benefits to be obtained. I have a real interest in this subject as I have co-operated in research on the subject. The need for further research is very great indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of April I asked Questions of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and of the Secretary of State for Scotland, about the amount
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
of the research being carried out. The Minister of Agriculture gave figures for England, and it was disappointing to me that in the most recent years the figure amounted to less than £4,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Scotland was unable to find out just how much has been spent in Scotland. There is no question of the value of shelter belts and this shows how little interest is taken by Government circles in this important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tremendous need for research from the point of view of informing farmers and others of the benefits which may be derived. Much more needs to be known about shelter belts. There is plenty of forestry knowledge, as was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker). Our knowledge about shelter belts is much less. It is unfortunate that the research is limited. It has been carried out by the Forestry Commission, the Hill Farming Research Organisation and the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at the University of Edinburgh. A higher degree of co-ordination of research is needed and more money should be provided. There is great opportunity for this in the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Edinburgh University which is a body concerned exclusively neither with forestry nor agriculture. I plead with the Minister for the provision of more money for research. We should be helping to integrate forestry and agriculture. We know that in certain areas controversy rages between those two aspects of land utilisation. I ask the Minister what he envisages may be the development, not just in respect of the establishment of shelter belts but in encouraging and financing of further research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to take up much time but I should like to say one or two things about this group of Amendments because like my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (the Earl of Dalkeith) I was unable to be present at the meeting of the Committee last Thursday. In answering the various points, which I have read in the OFFICIAL REPORT the Minister of State made one statement which I do not quite understand. He said that the Board would have all these functions, provided—if I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
got his words correctly—that they did not override other statutory authorities. This is one of the problems which is uppermost in the minds of my hon. Friends, and, I think, in the mind of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) as well. We feel that this integration—if I may use that word in a different sense—between the Board and other statutory authorities, whether the Crofters Commisison, the county councils, the Forestry Commission, or any other body, has not yet really been thought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with what has been said about shelter belts and their importance for agricultural purposes and also for providing in many cases extra material for the pulp mills and other users of timber. I agree very much with what my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has said about research and proper provision for shelter belts in areas which up to now have not been thought suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little surprised—perhaps it was because he was not present at the last meeting of the Committee—that my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North should have expressed astonishment and wonder at the hon. Member for the Western Isles talking a lot of good sense; I was surprised because, as far as I can see, the hon. Member for the Western Isles was quoting pretty well exactly things which for a considerable time I have been saying ought to be done in the Highland area. I am aware of the need for many of these things. Both from personal experience, and from what I had the opportunity to study in the Scottish Office and outside, I am only too well aware that we are not yet in a position—because we have not the basic research for regeneration in the Highland area and the growing of trees—to undertake schemes involving large group areas of regeneration, which I hope one day will come. If we were to carry out such schemes now, we should be liable to have large and expensive failures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote one example which may be familiar to the Minister. In almost all the material on research into and experimental work on the growing of grass—a great deal of this research has been carried out at Aberystwyth—the concluding phrase is, "If you allow sheep on this grass, you will ruin it." This is one of our problems in the Highlands.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
It is one of the things we have not learned enough about—how to grow grass which will not be ruined by excessive sheep grazing in the early days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A valuable point was made by my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North which I hope has been noted by the Minister. He suggested that a good deal of the work could be done by people other than the Forestry Commission. In a great many of its Reports, and in the discussions we have had, the Commission has put on record its appreciation of the fact that most—most of the research work in planting timber and providing shelter belts and so on has been carried out by private individuals, among whom the family of my noble Friend have been outstanding examples in Scotland in this connection. So I hope the Minister will take up this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee wish to support the Amendments. We have the reservation, made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), about maintaining and managing regeneration schemes because I do not think this is probably the best method of carrying out the schemes, but that is a minor point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point which has been made in almost all the speeches from the other side. If the right hon. Member will look at the Amendment, he will see that I suggest the Board should assist crofters and others in promoting and developing and maintaining shelter belts, presumably when required to do so. I do not suggest that the Board should take the initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a desire to deal speedily with the matter, I may have not been sufficiently careful in studying the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point which may not have been realised by the hon. Member for the Western Isles, but one which I think is of great importance to the Committee is that in subsection (1), in reference to the erection of buildings and the provision of equipment and services the Board may
	<br><blockquote><p>"on or in connection with land, hold, manage, maintain, hire, let or otherwise dispose of such works, equipment or services."</p></blockquote>
These are at this point comparatively minor things, but they are also the only
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
things in the whole of the Bill which—if my reading of the Bill is correct—the Board may do without the express authority of the Secretary of State. The theme of almost all we have been saying in the Committee is that if we are to have a Board comprised of the right sort of people then within certain limits it should be given authority to carry out its own work. As these Amendments are all within the part of the Bill which gives that authority to the Board, I think it right that the Committee should support them and I hope that the Minister will accept them. We feel that they would improve the powers of the Board over its own functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fairly wide discussion and I wish only to take up two points made by the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (the Earl of Dalkeith). I do not think that he should be allowed to get away with them. The noble Lord rightly associated himself with the remarks of his hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) who approved of the Glenlivet plantings. He continued by saying that the reason there has not been greater afforestation is the obduracy of the crofting community. That is not so. The noble Lord quoted one example from my own constituency, at Skye, of a certain philanthopic landlord, of whose identity, unfortunately, I am not aware, who is prepared to pay out large sums of money so that forestry may go ahead. I do not think that a proper representation of the actual facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the principal reasons why we have to have a Development Board, and are discussing Amendments of this kind, is that many members of the crofting community have rightly been concerned at the way in which the Forestry Commission has, naturally, tended so far as possible to take the best land. At Glenroy, in my own constituency, this led to real conflict between agriculture and forestry, the sort of conflict which I hope that the Board will resolve. I think it wrong that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) may have taken me wrongly. I specifically said that one of the main obstacles to the extra planting of trees was the antagonism of the farming community generally. I certainly did not refer to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
crofters as examples of those who stand in the way of forestry, but the hon. Member knows as well as I do that throughout the British Isles farmers are generally very strongly opposed to an increase of tree growing unless it can be proved in advance that that can be harmonised with their agricultural operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the last statement of the noble Lord. I feel that he has shifted his ground. He was saying at one stage that the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we are going a little wide. The discussion relates only to shelter belts and not to the question of afforestation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. I was merely endeavouring to indicate that in my view one of the essential things that the Board must do is try to achieve a balance which we all wish to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise that the fault by no means lies only with the crofting community. I can think of a number of examples in my own constituency where philanthropic landlords have refused to take any steps in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord emphasised one of the important things in these Amendments—he was taken up by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble)—relating to the giving of a degree of independence to the Board. I wholly agree with that. There should be room for private enterprise, but the reason why we must have the Bill is because private enterprise by itself has failed. Therefore, we need to bring in a certain degree of Government intervention and we are now engaging in what I would be much happier to have described as a co-operative venture, in which there is room for public and private enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members on both side of the Committee who have spoken in support of the Amendments. Indeed, as a result of their remarks we have learned a lot. The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker), who spoke about co-operative endeavours in his own area among tenants, owners and the Forestry Commission, gave what I thought was one of the very best examples of what we want to see being
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
promoted more widely in shelter belts and afforestation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (the Earl of Dalkeith) has benefited considerably as a result of his own absence from this Committee. Since he himself has observed that his appreciation of good sense had been increased as a result of it, perhaps it would be better if he stayed away altogether. I noted his comments endorsed the importance of shelter belt planting. One of the difficulties associated with the Amendments, he said, arose from the lack of local initiative. I assure the Committee that where this is so, it has been due to the lack of accumulation of local capital and not the lack of co-operation among farmers and crofters. The lack of capital has been holding back these developments for generations—and not the lack of enterprise or willingness to co-operate. Money comes slowly, Seneca said, to poor places. This is still particularly true in the depopulated and the so-called remoter areas. This is, therefore, a question of the lack of capital and not a lack of the local desire to co-operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, I have not found co-operation lacking. Whenever a scheme is put up and the capital for it is found, from whatever the source or sources, there is plenty of co-operation. A fine example of this was at Raasay Island, where crofter co-operation, and latterly, enthusiasm was tremendous. It is regrettable that in both the First and Second World Wars this and most much bigger other areas were denuded of timber. We came to realise the importance of timber only during the war years, unfortunately, only when a great many lives were lost and ships in the convoys were sunk. Timber is always required for our national survival, whether in peace time or war time; and before each of the two wars there was far too little afforestation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the scheme at Raasay, and in other schemes where the finance has been forthcoming, there has been ample cooperation. In the Raasay case, the initiative was taken by the Highlands and Islands Panel, representing all public interests concerned in the Highlands and Islands. That competent and distinguished civil servant, Mr. Dickie, now retired, was, happily involved, in those matters at that time. His tact in public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
relations and his expert knowledge made the scheme possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another good example are the Moorland regeneration schemes in the Western Isles. There regeneration started with the full enthusiasm of the crofters themselves. The crofters came together, considered the matters involved, weighed the arguments and gave their full participating co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will have another look at these Amendments. I have used the words "assist, promote or undertake" and my hon. Friend will see, from the discussion, that no hon. Member has quarrelled with the desirability of the general assistance or, even, promotion of schemes. This wording visualises a case of the Board suggesting for example, that a shelter belt in some locality would be of use and value to all concerned—for agriculture, tourist, amenity reasons and so on. We here get to the point of promotion without there being any difference of opinion in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have deliberately included the words "or undertake" because that is intended as a sort of reserve power and provision—a last resort—so that where nobody is prepared, perhaps even the Forestry Commission, to go directly ahead with a scheme on its own, it might be prepared nevertheless, to assist and give expert advice in various ways if someone else, say the Board should sponsor it. Perhaps for good reason, the Forestry Commission might not want itself to go ahead with a small job. Yet it might be prepared to assist by giving advice and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, it might be necessary for the Board to undertake responsibility for such a scheme. I am obviously not thinking in terms of the members or staff of the Highland Development Board themselves putting up fences and planting and so on. They are not likely to be or, even, employ experts in that job. I am thinking in terms of them undertaking a scheme in the sense of taking responsibility for its promotion; insuring that the auspices are guaranteed if, for example, the Forestry Commission or Department of Agriculture is unwilling to undertake the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most interested in the remarks about marine works of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) who was a Scottish Under-Secretary in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
former Administration. In that position I want to say that he was of great help to me in trying to push on with a number of schemes which had been delayed not for years but for decades. His remarks about the desirability of getting rid of the present dual responsibility—this eternal shuffling of responsibility from one Department to another and to and from county councils and from one level to another—were extremely interesting and I agree that we should get rid of this dual buck passing. It would be an excellent thing to have one authority taking responsibility, but whether it should be the Highland Development Board or another organisation I cannot say, though I have suggested it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that my wording in the Amendments should be the last word. Since there is no single body responsible at present the situation is unsatisfactory. I am suggesting, therefore, that the Board should have the power, at least, to assume as of right responsibility for works of this kind, for it has become obvious that progress is not likely to be made under the present dual system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I state in the next Amendment that the Board should
	<br><blockquote><p>"assist crofters and others in promoting, developing, maintaining and managing"</p></blockquote>
schemes of various kinds. Here the operative word is "assist" and I cannot say that there has been any disagreement so far expressed by hon. Members about this or about the principle underlying any of the Amendments standing in my name. Indeed, the Minister did not say that there was any opposition on his part to the principle involved and I think that he agrees with the spirit and purpose of them. If there is no opposition to them anywhere in the Committee, and since my hon. Friend agrees with the spirit and general purpose of them, cannot he accept them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the form of words I have used is correct. I am never wedded to the precise wording of Amendments. If the Minister will look at the matter further and is prepared to say that he agrees to try and meet the purpose underlying the Amendments, I think that we can all agree that we have discussed these matters quite fully. The feelings on both sides of the Committee have been well ventilated and are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
strongly in favour of the substance of the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient if I were to answer now some of the points which have been raised. I pointed out to the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (the Earl of Dalkeith) that the Board would be able to use the services of any body in order to get the jobs done that it wants to have done—and that includes private owners in connection with forestry. So there is no difficulty about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) raised the question of research. The Board has power in Clause 9(1,c)
	<br><blockquote><p>"to carry out or commission the carrying out of such enquiries, investigations or researches"</p></blockquote>
it considers necessary for its activities. The Board would not be likely to carry out its own research if it could get that work done better by the organisation which should be doing it—and the hon. Gentleman indicated that he was aware of the work that is being done by the Forestry Commission and by other organisations—for example, by Edinburgh University. The short answer to him, therefore, is that under Clause 9(1,c) the Board has power to carry out or commission work of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyle (Mr. Noble) said he did not understand my remarks about working with or overriding other authorities. I have explained the position and I am sure that if the right hon. Gentleman considers the matter he will see what will happen under the Bill. In the course of the preparation of specific proposals the Board will consult the people concerned and discuss how best certain things can be done. If the proposals involve the carrying out of a certain amount of afforestation, the Board will, of course, consult the Forestry Commission. One would imagine that the Board would consult owners and ask them about the carrying out of works of this kind, if such activities fitted the proposals under consideration. Clearly, in those discussions the Board will try to get the agreement of all the parties involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bound to happen that people will say, "We cannot do it. We cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
afford to do it". The Board will then have to consider the matter fully to see whether arrangements can be made with the body or person concerned to see if assistance can be given. The Bill gives power to the Board to undertake the giving of assistance if anything can be satisfactorily arranged in the fashion I have described. Thus, the short answer to the right hon. Gentleman is that the Board already has these powers under the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A scheme having been proposed, it then goes to the Secretary of State, who will himself look at it, will no doubt make inquiries as to whether certain bodies, organisations and people are prepared to go through with the scheme and will make other inquiries about the work itself. He will obviously want to know whether arrangements have been made by the Board with the persons and organisations concerned, and then the Board will be responsible for seeing that the scheme is carried out. That is the way we visualise the Board working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reply to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), I do not quarrel with the substance of any of his Amendments. Indeed, no hon. Member has quarrelled with their substance. We all agree—hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—that all these things should be done and that they are important. The general feeling of the Committee has been that the Board should have powers to do these things and see that they are done. We are not quarrelling with the Amendments or the spirit of them, but with the question of whether the words contained in them should go into the Bill. I have already pointed out that the Board already has powers under the Bill to do these things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister deal with the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), who spoke of the distinction between the nature of the two powers in Clauses 3 and 5? My right hon. Friend pointed out the difference; that the powers in Clause 5 are entirely at the initiative of the Board and that if the Amendments are incorporated in Clause 5 the Board will be able to do these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
things without having to go to the Secretary of State. While I agree that the Board has power, as the Minister said, to do these things, the distinction is that it must get the consent of the Secretary of State before doing them. As I understand the whole object of this exercise, it is to give greater freedom to the Board to be able to do these things without getting the consent and approval of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I shall be able to say something about that point in a moment. At the present time I am saying that the Board already has power to do all the things proposed in the Amendments. We do not have to put these into the Bill. The Amendments are unnecessary. By putting in these words, we call into question the other powers of the Board. I mentioned a number of items that we might well have to specify, if we picked out these particular aspects of the Board's work and specified them. By the acceptance of the Amendments we do not strengthen the powers of the Board; rather do we question the generality of the powers given by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) raised the question of the sanction of the Secretary of State. The Clause, as I understand it, deals with a number of things that can be done by the Board without the permission of the Secretary of State. These are, in the main, of a general character. We do not specify the works that can be done; we rather enumerate certain categories that the Board can carry out without asking for the approval of the Secretary of State. The works for which sanction is given in the Clause are of a general character and such as one would expect to be done in carrying out the wider schemes which are approved by the Secretary of State.

To that extent, the works suggested in the Amendments are rather different, and whether or not we should include the functions mentioned in the three Amendments is a matter for debate. I should have thought there were arguments for not including them in this Part of the Bill because they are of a wider character, and may involve substantial projects for which the approval of the Secretary of State ought to be needed.

That is the answer to the hon. and learned Member, but I am prepared to look at the matter again. I am not making any commitment. I have said that the Board has certain powers, but between now and Report I am prepared to consider this point. In any case, even if the Amendments were acceptable, we would have to put down other Amendments to safeguard the generality of the Clause. I cannot go any further than that at the moment. I am not giving any formal undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the Amendment is to narrow the scope of the powers contained in the Clause. If we are to have the Clause at all it should be narrowed, because there is nothing in the Clause to restrict the Board's activities to the matters

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that we were to have very strong moral support for this Amendment from the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) and I am sorry to hear that he is not giving us that support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I am moving the Amendment is that we are concerned to obtain finance for schemes in the Highlands and Islands, and the Board and the Secretary of State for Scotland may come very much under the control of the Treasury. We all appreciate that control of the Treasury can be very limiting and can lie as a dead hand on ambitious and enterprising schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In judging proposals of this kind, the Treasury is apt to consider what return they will produce. Its standpoint is economic. The problems of the Highlands cannot be judged purely by economic criteria. We have to take into account social values and other criteria for which there is no exact economic measurement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor is that the Treasury is very remote from the areas we are discussing. People in the Treasury are not conversant with what is happening in the Highlands or with the problems which the Highland Development Board will be trying to solve, and there is unlikely to be sufficient appreciation of the nature of these problems. My argument is very strongly reinforced by what has happened in recent weeks when we have seen examples of Treasury control. A few weeks ago there was the Farm Price Review. I like to think that the Minister of Agriculture and Secretary of State for Scotland have a very real appreciation of the problems facing agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Member is not proposing to start a discussion this morning on the Farm Price Review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Steele. I am merely using this example to reinforce my arguments for the Amendment, and I shall use it only briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not question the intentions of the Secretary of State for Scotland or of the Minister of Agriculture in desiring to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
help agriculture in the Farm Price Review, but there is no doubt that the hand of the Treasury came into it and that those who represented the views of Agriculture in the Cabinet were vetoed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is the deflationary measures in the Budget. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had given hope that areas requiring development, or with exceptionally high unemployment, or needing new industry might be excepted from the measures which he was proposing for deflation. When the event came, this did not happen. The whole blanket of deflation was spread right over the country. Those are two examples of how Treasury control ignores the disadvantages of less fortunate areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the two examples which the hon. Member has given, can he give us proof of the statements he is making?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Member does not accept that invitation. I have already indicated I do not want a long dissertation on the Farm Price Review. The hon. Member said he was using this as a short example. I hope he leaves the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Of course I respectfully accept your Ruling. The Amendment is dealing with Treasury control and the words "and the Treasury" and the hon. Member has given an exposition of what he thinks the Treasury does in certain circumstances. I merely put the other side of the coin that he has not proved his case that the Treasury has been blameworthy in this respect, and I was merely asking him to prove what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member has already said has been rather on the balance of being in order in any case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the Ruling of the Chair. I would refer the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) to the OFFICIAL REPORT of the debate in the House on the Annual Price Review, and there he will find the support for my argument. I have shown how, in particular decisions taken recently, Treasury control has restricted development right across the economy, including areas of Scotland, where
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
development might have taken place had it not been for the element of Treasury control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for proposing the Amendment is the fear that what good the Highland Development Board may be able to do may be hindered by having this element of Treasury control and that this may be aggravated by the remoteness of the Treasury from the area of the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Amendments would not be necessary if I could be certain that, on the question of getting money for Scotland and the Highlands, the Secretary of State would be able to fight within the Cabinet to get the money. The Farm Price Review and the Budget are, I believe, two examples where the Secretary of State has been unable to fight for the needs of Scotland within the Cabinet. This is the real reason behind the Amendment. If we on this side of the Committee could be certain that the Secretary of State were genuine and had strength in fighting for Scotland the Amendment would not be necessary. I am certain that with the right Secretary of State, particularly from this side of the Committee, there would be no need for the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having formally dissociated myself from the Amendment since the addition of my name was somebody's very minor error, I have at the same time a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Member has advocated. Hon. Members from this side have made in the past almost exactly the same speech as the hon. Member has made this morning. I made it myself frequently many times. Broadly the feeling has been that once Parliament has voted global allocations to the various Ministries, it should not be eternally necessary on every item of expenditure for them to go back and argue out with the Treasury not only financial but also technical and other aspects. We have put this case time after time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason why I cannot go all the way with this Amendment as such is that I do not think we can cure this trouble under one Clause in this Bill. To my mind it has always been absurd that Parliament, having voted money to the Scottish Office, has on almost every item to come back to the Treasury and argue it all out again, sometimes taking months
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
and coming to the next financial year and even beyond that. We have even seen at times unexpended money voted to Scotland virtually returned to the Treasury or being applied as part of the next year's Vote. In our view that is a dead loss to possibly very urgent and useful expenditure in the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am not sure that the Treasury is always to blame. I found myself on one important Highland occasion having to go to see Sir Stafford Cripps when he was Chancellor. We had a long talk and I found him sympathetic about Highland problems. As a result of that meeting we had another long formal meeting. The Secretary of State at that time, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) and myself went along and had a full session with the Chancellor on Highland and Island problems. One of the things he asked us to do was not to save money in the Highlands, but to get a blueprint or possibly produce a White Paper which would give him the justification for looking and planning four, five, or ten years ahead in Highland expenditure, a White Paper which could be presented to the House of Commons for general acceptance, if possible, and which would give the Treasury and himself justification for thinking five and more years ahead and planning accordingly. The White Paper was accepted by the House. This was something we had wanted for a long time. Here was the Chancellor suggesting that particular course of action and he was prepared to back it up within the limited resources of those difficult postwar times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not always necessarily the Treasury that is to blame, but I agree with the hon. Member that it has been offensive to all Scottish members that the Secretary of State should be going back to plead repeatedly to spend money already allocated to him for Scottish purposes. However I do not think this limited Amendment is the way to cure it. It is a general problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we have a Bill which ostensibly is going to give the greatest possible benefits to the Highlands and contiguous parts. The Secretary of State is setting up a Board to which he has given most extraordinary powers to set up businesses, buy land, and do all
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
sorts of things throughout the Highlands and the north of Scotland, which we hope will be of great benefit to the north of Scotland. Then having set up the Board he immediately clips its wings and says that anything it does and all the powers under the Bill have to be with his consent. That seems to me a not unreasonable thing because after all the Board being set up by the Secretary of State is going to have to expend a great deal of money. It seems to me reasonable that the Secretary of State should have some sort of financial control over the Board because after all he is the person accountable to Parliament and ultimately to the electorate for the cost of these works. It seems reasonable. What I cannot possibly understand is that the Secretary of State with all his good intentions of setting up the Board and keeping control of the Board to himself, should then clip his own wings and have to go to the Treasury and say, "Please may I spend some money?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that this Bill with all its possibilities for the north of Scotland will be stultified by the dead hand of the Treasury. In all kinds of Scottish legislation we find the same kind of thing, that the Secretary of State, no matter how good his ideas and intentions are, finds himself stultified and nullified by the dead hand of the Treasury. How often have I heard the Minister of State make this complaint? Scottish needs are great, but here we are having to go to the Treasury and say, "Please may we spend some money?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we refer to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill we find that the amount of money intended to be spent in the first year is a miserable £150,000. In other words the Secretary of State who is introducing the Bill is limited by the dead hand of the Treasury to £150,000. Then in subsequent years all the good works contemplated by the Bill which are going to do so much for the Highlands and the north of Scotland are to be limited by the dead hand of the Treasury to £1 million or such lesser sum, I have no doubt, as the Treasury thinks fit. In other words, not even £1 million is at the disposal of the Secretary of State. He has to go on his hands and knees to Great George Street and say, "Please may I approve what this Board, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
has been set up by Parliament, is proposing to do?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister of State, after all his protestations throughout the last Parliament and the Parliament before that, could have produced something better than this Bill, in which he and his right hon. Friend are depriving themselves in this way. I do hope that the Secretary of State, whom I aam sorry to see is not a member of this Committee, will read what I have to say and that the Minister of State will explain this to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the right hon. Gentleman will go to the Cabinet and seek to cut out, either now or at the appropriate stage, these offending words, and make sure that our responsible Scottish Ministers do not have to crawl to the English Treasury—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The dead hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—the dead hand—and that we in Scotland are treated as responsible persons and responsible Members of Parliament and that our Scottish Ministers, from whichever side they may spring, are treated as responsible Ministers and given the proper authority by Parliament to do for Scotland, and the Highlands and Islands in particular, what is so much required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for me to tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State what the hon. Member has said because we could have written his speech for him at least a month ago. We know that speech pretty well, as it has certain peculiarities. One is that in spite of being a lawyer he does not seem to be able to read the Bill. Neither does he seem to be able to understand the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. This is one of the characteristics of speeches made by the hon. Member, and this is why we have a pretty shrewd idea of the kind of things he will say, even though they are grossly inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury is, of course, responsible for guarding the overall economic policy of the nation, and it has certain responsibilities to the House of Commons for public expenditure. That responsibility to the House of Commons is also a responsibility to the British taxpayers
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
for money which is being spent. Therefore, it plays a part when money is being spent, and Ministers, not only the Secretary of State for Scotland, find themselves having to go to the Treasury when they require money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Amendment No. 27 would make the power of the Board to acquire or set up and carry on any business or undertaking subject only to the approval of the Secretary of State. This involves the question of Government policy, and possibly very substantial expenditures, and clearly in that case the Treasury should have an effective interest and responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought, too, that the Clause would help to allay some of the fear expressed by the Opposition who suggest that it goes too far. Here are two safeguards—the Secretary of State and the Treasury. I have never been able to understand the criticisms of hon. Members opposite that the Bill goes too far in all sorts of respects—especially in this Clause—while, at the same time, they try to destroy the safeguards incorporated in the Bill to prevent the abuse of power by the Board. This schizophrenic approach to the Bill has characterised right hon. and hon. Members opposite ever since it was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The acceptance of Amendment No. 30 would make the arrangements under which the Board would have power to give financial assistance for industrial, commercial or other undertakings
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any activity which in the opinion of the Board will contribute to the economic or social development of the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
subject only to the approval of the Secretary of State. Once again, we have to fit in with overall Government policy. Arrangements made under the Clause must fit in with other forms of assistance, such as is provided by B.O.T.A.C., and for this reason, and also because it is important that the arrangements made under the Clause should, as effectively as possible, give the Board a discretion within a wide field, we feel that the words should be kept in. Our object is more likely to be achieved in association with the Treasury. Once again, substantial expenditures are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 35, to Clause 9, deals with the power to make charges, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
similar matters. We feel that this is an essential point of control involving the co-ordination of Government activities affecting national finance and Government policies relating to the financing of public authorities. This is a matter in which the Treasury should be brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 43 deals with payments to meet the expenses of the Board. All the precedents, in all the Bills introduced by Conservative Governments, show that expenses of this character should be approved by the Treasury. When the Conservative Government were introducing Bills incorporating such clauses as this I do not remember the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) making the sort of fiery speech which he has just made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Amendments to the Schedule, Amendment No. 49 would make the remuneration of members of the Board subject only to the approval of the Secretary of State. The argument against this is a very simple one. It is that there must be reasonable consistency or, at any rate, co-ordination in the matter of remuneration of members of statutory bodies, and the Department that achieves this reasonable consistency is the Treasury. That is one of its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 50 would be to allow the Secretary of State alone to order payment of compensation to a member who is compelled to resign prematurely from the Board. Where compensation for premature resignation from a statutory body is deemed necessary, it is desirable that the compensation should be consistent as between one body and another. In the past the Treasury has been responsible for achieving this and we propose that it should continue to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 51 would be to allow the Secretary of State alone to decide how much compensation should be payable to a member of the Board on premature loss of office. The argument that I have adduced previously applies here. It is desirable that where the payment of compensation for premature loss of office is deemed necessary there should be some consistency between statutory bodies in the amount payable in particular circumstances. The Treasury sees that that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
The effect of Amendment No. 53 would be to allow the Board, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to determine the number and remuneration of its employees. The same argument applies that I have put forward previously concerning consistency in amounts of remuneration payable to members of statutory bodies, and there is the added argument that the Treasury has the experience and expertise in establishment matters, and is the most appropriate authority to consult in matters of staffing complement and conditions of service, including remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last Amendment—Amendment No. 59—would make the Secretary of State the sole determinant of travelling and subsistence expenses for members of the Council. The argument against this is that the Treasury at present provides by regulation for the payment of travelling, subsistence and other expenses to unpaid members of commissions and committees. There are standard rules and regulations governing this matter, and these rules and regulations, which are often approved by this House, are laid down by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to my hon. Friends for having agreed to take all these Amendments together.

The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) made an extremely valid point—so long as his lettering was right. He said that he had noticed that whenever the Conservative Party was in opposition it became Scottish nationalist in tendency. That is quites right, provided the word "nationalist" is spelt with a small "n". I have observed that the Labour Party, when in power, becomes steadily more conservative, with a small "c", to the extent that it produces no new ideas but merely a lot of extra dogma, a great deal of which is embedded in this Clause. We in Scotland—and I speak for more than the Conservative Party, with a large "C"—appreciate that when the Labour Party is in office there is inevitably more and more State control and nationalisation, which necessarily means that the control of the affairs of Scotland tends to be pulled to London. I do not want to get out of order, but we have only to consider the question of steel, B.E.A., coal, and the railways to understand straightaway the pull which operates. I touch on that point only to illustrate the argument of the hon. Member for the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with him that the Treasury is by no means always to blame; it is often the best device for a Minister to use—in that he can always say that he cannot get things because the Treasury has refused them. Historically it is reasonably accurate to say that in the last few years—I have been searching my memory without success—we have not had a Scots Chancellor of the Exchequer. We have had Prime Ministers by the dozen in the past, not to mention Lord Chancellors and people who have filled many other key points, including the office of Foreign Secretary, but it is a long time since we had a Scottish Chancellor of the Exchequer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has missed the point. The Conservative Government had 13 years in which to find Scots Chancellors, but they were so busy doing other work that they left the affairs of Scotland in the hands of successive Scottish Secretaries of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the last two years at least no Secretary of State could have
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then what is the right hon. Gentleman complaining about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because, in watching the events of the last few months, and having studied history, my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that this is one of the questions in respect of which the two parties change sides whenever they change their positions in Parliament. From many of the remarks made by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and also the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) it is clear that they are like tapsal-teeree twins who interchange from time to time to suit themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the arguments of the Minister. It is clear that not all the Amendments are acceptable. I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's general argument about Treasury control, and how detailed it must be. We agree that everything goes back to the Treasury. If the Board proposed to borrow money, as is suggested in Clause 9, the consent of the Treasury would be required. In that case the Treasury clearly needs to come in.

But I do not completely accept the arguments adduced by the hon. Member relating to the Amendments to the Schedule. I am always prepared to learn in these matters, and I am happy to see that the hon. Member for Argyll is also prepared to learn. Amendment No. 50 relates to paragraph 6(b) of the First Schedule. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if … it appears to the Secretary of State that there are special circumstances which make it right that that person should receive compensation the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, require the Board to pay to that person a sum"</p></blockquote>
and so on. When we decide whether someone deserves compensation surely it is not a question of obtaining Treasury approval. It may well be that the approval of the Treasury would be necessary when we come to pay compensation,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
but I should not think it necessary when deciding whether compensation should be received, but I may have missed something. Other than that, it seems to me the arguments of the Minister are reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another connection he referred to category sanction. I should think that here also there would be a case, when it came to certain expenditures of the Board, for endeavouring to introduce some sort of category sanction, so that, in relation to compensation and particular expenses and salaries, the Board did not need to go back each time to the Treasury. It would have a sum of money to allocate in the way it wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it most amusing to listen to speeches from each side of the Committee from hon. Members pretending to do battle over things about which previously they battled from opposite sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those of us who served on Committees during the last Parliament waited with bated breath to see how the Minister would handle this Amendment. I suppose that what he did was right strategically—he attacked my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) after his most moderate speech. The Minister did a great deal of blustering and went into what was a most extraordinary piece of lyrical praise of the Treasury, in which he referred to the expertise shown by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask whether the Minister is
	<br><blockquote><p>"under the dictatorship of the Treasury? Is he acting as messenger boy … and just carrying out instructions laid down by the Chancellor of the Exchequer?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 30th January, 1962, c. 39.]</p></blockquote>
In doing so I am using the words which he used during the Committee stage discussions on the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already told the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) that I find it highly commendable that he should devote himself so assiduously to my speeches. It will improve his Parilamentary performances enormously. I have no objection to the hon. Member quoting me. I find it rather praiseworthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
I rose to reply to the hon Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). Regarding category provisions, under Clause 14(1) the hon. Member will see that I have an Amendment on the Notice Paper by which category approval will be applicable in the case of Treasury sanction. It will obviate the detailed provisions about which hon. Members have expressed anxiety. Similarly arrangements made under the first part of Clause 8 will be dealt with. The Treasury will approve a scheme and it will cover all the arrangements made under the scheme and the grants and loans made under Clause 8 will not require specific approval. They will fall within the general arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intensely interested in the speech of the "Leader of the Opposition" the right hon. Member for Argyle (Mr. Noble). Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman might care to expand his concluding statement. He said that his hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) had the right to move an Amendment. No one disputes that. The right hon. Gentleman did not take the further step, which I thought he might in the circumstances have taken, and go on to say that he supported the Amendment. Why did not the right hon. Gentleman say that he supported it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any hon. Member in the Committee can put down any Amendment which is phrased intelligibly and in intelligent English. I am sorry to have to use the word "English" after what we have heard about an English Chancellor of the Exchequer and the lack of a Scottish Chancellor. Would not any member of the Tory Party like to set an example in Scottish nationalism by using old Scots when framing Amendments? If they would, why do they not do so? I am as good a Scotsman as any Englishman on the opposite side of the Committee or any Scotsman—[HON. MEMBERS: "Who?"]—Dr. Who is not present. If they are not English by nationality they are English by training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And by education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After 13 years of failure to find a good Scottish Chancellor, it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
is remarkable that the right hon. Gentleman, who stood up to defend a right which no one challenges, should have refused to face an issue which, as the leader of the Opposition in this Committee, he should have faced. Does the right hon. Gentleman support the Amendments of his hon. Friends that Treasury approval should be cut out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have been prepared to support that, but what are we to put in its place? Should we have a Scottish Treasury? Are we going back to the claim, which I believe could be substantiated, that Scotland pays more from her own Income Tax to the English Treasury than she ought to do? Do hon. Members opposite believe all those things which I think can be substantiated, and if they do, why do not they do something about them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Member for Argyll proposes to be honest with the Committee he should not merely defend a right which does not need to be defended; he should tell us whether he supports the Amendments and whether he will vote for them should they go to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) is, as usual, trying to waste the time of the Committee. He did not even take the trouble to listen to what I said. Perhaps if I made my speeches as lengthily and as slowly as he does it would help him in his understanding. I said that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) was right to move his Amendment and I think that he was, for the reasons which I stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Govan has got me to my feet I will comment on what was said by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). The hon. Member said that he had been amused at what he had heard. He has been a Member of the House of Commons for as long as only six months, but eventually he will find that different attitudes taken by hon. Members when they are on different sides of the House are reasonable. We know that in Government the Labour Party is very different from what it is when in Opposition, and so we often have to challenge the Government. We have sympathy for the hon. Member for Inverness, because whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
happens in the House of Commons he sits in the same place and makes the same sort of noises. The hon. Gentleman must not blame us for changing our attitude if the Government of the day change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friends were right to put down these Amendments. If the hon. Member for Govan, who studies the Notice Paper with such care, will look at Amendment No. 28, he will see that it is designed to leave out this Clause, and therefore I do not need to support the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been astounded by some of the arguments which I have heard since I moved my Amendment, and particularly by what has been said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). From what he has said, one might be forgiven for thinking that it was something of which to be ashamed if one stood up for Scotland and were a Scottish Nationalist with a small "s" and a small "n". I am not in the least ashamed to be that. One of the reasons I am here is to see that Scotland gets a proper share of what is going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has hidden behind a smokescreen of Amendments and has failed to grasp the purpose behind this particular Amendment. I appreciate that he must speak to individual Amendments and that in relation to some it is right that Treasury approval should be retained, but in dealing with specific Amendments the Minister skated over the whole question of the extent of Treasury control in Scotland. He referred to precedents and implied that where there are precedents we must bow to them. If this Government are to be dynamic and progressive, they should be prepared to override precedents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Budget debate I invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be progressive and dynamic in his financial policy by excluding areas of Scotland from tax on spirits and on road fuel and thereby solving the problem of migration. This is another case where the Minister could indicate that he is prepared to be progressive and dynamic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost all the arguments which have been advanced have reinforced what I said when I moved the Amendment. We have heard of the dead hand of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
Treasury and the delays which have taken place because of Treasury control. I should be out of order if I continued in this line, but one could take up all the rest of the Sitting today and the Sitting next Thursday by giving examples of how the Treasury has delayed and hindered development in Scotland. It is all very well for members of the Government to pay lip service to proposals to encourage regional development and to provide help in respect of local problems in Scotland, but it is not anything like enough merely to pay lip service. What counts at the end of the day is that the money is available so that projects may be put into effect. There must be some control over the way in which the money is spent, but final control should not always be from London, exercised by the Treasury and the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit behind the Amendment is the belief, which the Minister has failed to appreciate, that we should have more financial control over policy in Scotland so that, where circumstances require it, policy may be formed on a regional basis and not solely from the point of view of Great Britain as a whole. We want assurance that the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Scottish Office will fight for Scotland and Scottish needs during Cabinet discussions. The Minister has never given that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Making all the excuses one can for the exuberance of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) I must still ask whether he really means what he is saying? Can he mention one Minister who does not have to get Treasury authorisation for any scheme upon which it is proposed to embark?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends would show more exuberance.

In the Government, particularly the Scottish Ministers, we do not have any exuberance, certainly not the kind of exuberance which will bring to Scotland a share of the prosperity and affluence which other areas in the country enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's speech was typical of Government speeches since October; full of words and promises but nothing to show that we are going to get things moving in Scotland. In view of the hon. Gentleman's reply I cannot withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 20, after "Treasury" to insert "by agreement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment does not give scope for much exuberance, I am afraid. Its purpose is to make clear that the powers contained in the Clause do not extend to and include powers of compulsory purchase in this matter. I would be the first to accept that, on a fair reading of the Clause, as it stands, that is no doubt so, but there is, after all, a distinction drawn in Clause 4 between land which is acquired by agreement and land which is acquired compulsorily. I refer to Clause 4(1,a and b). It would be perfectly in order, and for the avoidance of any possible doubt in the matter, if the two short words "by agreement" were placed before the word "acquire" to ensure that we are dealing only with one power of acquisition—namely, acquisition by voluntary agreement—and that there is no question of compulsory acquisition being involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman satisfied that the words "by agreement" would apply only to acquiring? Would they not also apply to the words which follow, including the setting up and carrying on of businesses or undertakings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had thought of that. When one reads the provision, with the words "by agreement" included, one sees that it reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board may, with the approval of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
agreement acquire or set up and carry on …"</p></blockquote>
One sees that there the words "by agreement" govern those undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not pressing the Amendment. As I said, I am satisfied with the wording of the Clause as it stands. But doubts and concerns have been expressed about the matter and these would be dispelled by the introduction of the words "by agreement". I suggest, therefore, that it would be commendable, in view of the distinction drawn between Clause 4(1,a) and Clause 4(1,b) on the question of land, that the Amendment should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. and learned Gentlemn's point and I can give him a categorical assurance that the Amendment is unnecessary because, as he said, there is no doubt at all that the Clause does not give the Board power to acquire land by compulsion. The Board will not have power under the Clause compulsorily to acquire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that certain doubts have been expressed. The difficulty in accepting the Amendment is that, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said, if the words "by agreement" were inserted after the word "Treasury" they might govern all the other words that follow. I am prepared to look at the matter further with the possibility of inserting such words as "by agreement" after the word "acquire". It would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board may, with the approval of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, acquire by agreement or set up and carry on …".</p></blockquote>
As I say, I am prepared to look at the matter further. If it is necessary for anything to be done, an Amendment will be put down on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it might be better to insert the words at the point indicated by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain that even that will meet the point, although on interpretation normally I bow to the experience of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). Surely the acquiring, on the one hand, and the setting up or carrying on of a business are different things. If my hon. Friend does want to meet the point of the Amendment I do not think that his suggestion—of merely placing the words
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
"by agreement" after the word "acquire"—would meet the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was looking at this matter last night. It would seem, from a glance, that by placing "by agreement" after "acquire" we might achieve the desired effect. As I said, we will consider the matter further between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be the case—if "by agreement" were placed after "acquire"—that if agreement were not forthcoming the whole intention of the Clause would be destroyed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any case, if the Board wishes to acquire a business it must acquire it by agreement. It could not do it compulsorily under this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should we not face up to the possibility of the Board being frustrated unreasonably in its activities by somebody who is being implacably awkward? If the Board wished to do something which was obviously in the public interest and if an awkward customer of that sort faced the Board, surely the Board should be able to apply pressure to acquire, if it were obviously in the public interest that a particular activity should go ahead. I am speaking now of real anti-social obstruction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pointed out that although I have looked at the need to insert such words as "by agreement" I have not considered it very deeply. I will be doing so between now and Report. The argument now centres on the question whether the Board has the power to acquire compulsorily, and I said that the intention of the Clause is not to give the Board power to acquire privately-owned businesses in that way. It is intended to give the Board power to acquire them by agreement and certainly not by compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister has agreed to have another look at the matter I would withdraw the Amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend meant to say that he would have another look at it without committing himself to anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have another look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> In page 4, line 21, leave out "whether of a commercial nature or otherwise" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which in the opinion of the Board will contribute to the economic or social development of the Highlands and Islands".—	<i>[Mr. Willis.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This short Clause is one of the most important in the Bill and, from the point of view of my hon. Friends, is one of the most objectionable. In our discussions on the Amendments we have elucidated that the Government intend that the acquisition of any business or enterprise under the Clause should not be by compulsory means. As I read the Clause, the words "acquire or set up" mean that the Board could start a business. That must be so by the words "or set up" and presumably that would be done on land which it owns or has acquired under Clause 4, or land leased from somebody with permission to carry on a business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of the Clause is, as we pointed out on Second Reading, the combination of the powers in Clause 6 with the powers of compulsory purchase in Clause 4 and also with the powers of obtaining information, which we shall be coming to in Clause 11. In our opinion this combination makes the Clause far too wide. We will make it perfectly clear in the course of our debates that there is no schizophrenia in this matter. We consider that this goes much too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will put some questions to the Minister of State to ensure that we have the intention of the Clause correct. Are we right in thinking that any business of any kind would fall within the scope of the Clause? Do these powers extend, as in the case of compulsory purchase in Clause 4, to any part of Scotland? I assume, as I did on Clause 4, that they do not extend to other parts of the United Kingdom, but we would like to know the position geographically. When the Board is running a business, presumably it will make profits. Will those profits accrue to the Board in cases where it runs whole businesses? Will they be non-profit making concerns? Will there be special arrangements for financing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
On Second Reading the Secretary of State used words to the effect that these powers would be rarely used; that they would be in reserve. This seemed to recognise the contribution which private enterprise can make to the development of the Highlands and Islands. I am not sure that this view is shared by hon. Members opposite. It may be that the powers which are given by the combination of these three Clauses would rarely be used, in which case why is there need for them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may find ourselves with a Secretary of State who holds different views from the present one. I understand that the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr William Hamilton) does not necessarily agree with his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on this point. If the hon. Member for Fife, West became Secretary of State he might hold different views about the use of these powers. I thought I detected some words, used by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) at a previous Sitting, which were derogatory of private enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I detected that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Gentleman has in mind. He surely realises that the word "undertaking" covers a wide range of things. It might be concerned with a pier or jetty, which is still an undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has reservations, but if he reads his earlier remarks—when we were discussing the contribution which private enterprise firms can make in the Highlands and Islands—he will see that he rather poured scorn on this contribution. I am not satisfied that the views which he and other hon. Gentlemen opposite hold are views which would be consistent with these powers simply being held in reserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
