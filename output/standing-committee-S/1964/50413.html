	<p>[Mr. THOMAS STEELE in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>HIGHLAND DEVELOPMENT (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet this day at Four o'clock, on Tuesday, 27th April, at Four o'clock, on Thursday, 29th April, at half-past Ten o'clock, and thereafter on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It is clear from the proceedings of the Committee that a number of hon. Members wish to discuss the provisions of the Bill fairly fully, and I should be the last to complain about that. It does, however, place an obligation upon me to find the time for these discussions. I have had to consider what to do about this and how best we could provide extra Sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With my customary concern for right hon. and hon. Members opposite I appreciated right away that for very many years they have always expressed a great predilection in favour of Tuesday afternoons and have argued this at great length. When I asked myself what would be most suitable to us as the Government, I found that by a fortunate coincidence Tuesday afternoons were most suitable for us also. So that this happy coincidence between what hon. Members opposite have always expressed strong views about and the feelings of the Government made me suggest that we should meet on Tuesday afternoons. I am sure that in these circumstances there should not be any long discussion about the Motion and I hope that we shall be able to come to a decision about it fairly speedily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The Minister of State has kindly handed me a copy of the Motion and I am in process of trying to concoct suitable Amendments to it so that we may
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
have an orderly debate on the Motion. You will, I am sure, Mr. Steele, have read some of the proceedings of earlier debates when the Committee got into a good deal of trouble because hon. Members did not have time to put down their Amendments so that an orderly debate could take place. The result was that we had a great many points of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate what the right hon. Gentleman is saying, but there is no reason why this debate should not proceed on the Motion moved by the Minister. The right hon. Gentleman will have time to finish his Amendments and they can then be handed to me. Perhaps, therefore, the debate can continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my point of order, Mr. Steele, may I put this question to you? The problem is that there are two parts of a debate of this nature. It could be extended, if hon. Members wished, to a great many different parts, but the debate can best be conducted in two parts. One is to consider what alternatives are available which are convenient to either side of the Committee, and the second is whether a third Sitting during the week at this stage of the Bill is right. If I may have a moment or two, Mr. Steele—I have nearly got my Amendments right—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already indicated to the right hon. Gentleman that I appreciate the point which he is making. We have a Motion before us. We can discuss the Motion at the moment till the right hon. Gentleman has his Amendments ready and gives them to me. Then, we can proceed in the normal fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Steele. I do not profess to have the brains or the acumen of my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), but trying to draft Amendments while discussion is proceeding is extremely difficult—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee were informed last Thursday of what the substance of the Motion would be. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has had the Motion before him for some little time. I am not suggesting that the Committee discusses the Motion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
till the right hon. Gentleman has put his Amendments to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to probe a little further what my hon. Friend the Minister of State has said. We all know 'him as a person of fresh, original methods of thinking and vigorous ways of expressing his thought. When I listened to his speech, I wondered why he followed old courses. Tuesday and Thursday are two of the most crowded days in the week. I am overwhelmed with the various things which command my attention on those two days and I wondered whether, in exploring what might be the best occasion for further meetings of the Committee, my hon. Friend had given any thought to Friday. Friday is a day which is almost virgin in Parliamentary doings. Very little use is made of Friday. There would be no grumbles whatever that other business in the House demanded our attention on a Friday. By using Friday, an unexplored prairie would be opened up for any adventurer, especially one with the courage of my hon. Friend, who has never at any time failed to embark upon new and unexpected courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it in order, Mr. Steele, for the hon. Member for Kelvin-grove (Dr. Miller) to be reading a newspaper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only if it is in relation to a speech which he intends to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind my hon. Friend reading a paper, but I object to it when I am speaking. I am making an important point. Why do we not decide upon Friday? In that event, my hon. Friend would have no trouble. We could meet in the morning and in the afternoon. There would be no complaint of interference with other business. I hope, therefore, that when my hon. Friend replies he will tell us why he did not think of Friday, or, if he did think of it, why he rejected it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has stated, Tuesday is a difficult and busy day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has taken the hon. Gentleman a long time to realise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government, who are formed by the party opposite, have themselves put down important business for Tuesdays. If we were to meet this very day, it would mean that we would miss an important debate on the TSR2, about which many hon. Members on this side of the Committee are much concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this side, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there are hon. Members opposite who are also concerned about that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Casting one's mind back a week, last Tuesday we had the Budget. Tuesday was chosen by the Government and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as a proper day for that very important speech of the year—the speech introducing the Budget. If we go further back, we find that on another Tuesday this very Bill was introduced on the Floor of the House. That shows how, in the recent past, Tuesday afternoons on the Floor of the House have been occupied by important subjects. Therefore, we on this side do not welcome the Government's proposal. While we wish to have time for all the discussion which may be necessary in Committee on the Bill, the Motion which the Minister has moved is not very felicitous. It would mean that on Tuesdays we would be immured in this Room for most of the day, particularly during the time when important debates might very well take place on the Floor of the House. The Minister of State has himself made this point in the past on various occasions when he was on this side of the Committee. If there is to be a third Sitting in the week, we feel that there are other appropriate times when the Committee could sit and consider the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the discussions on the Bill so far, this side of the Committee has certainly not occupied all the time. There has been discussion from both sides. Hon. Members on both sides have shown that they are interested and concerned, and they have spoken at length on various points. The Minister cannot, therefore, level any charge against us as having taken up an excessive or inordinate amount of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that from the hon. Member. From a seated position, he says "Some of you". I do not accept that any right hon. or hon. Friend of mine has wasted time or occupied undue time in discussing the Bill so far. I do not make that charge against anyone on the other side of the Committee, either. The discussions so far have been very much to the point and have been concerned with the important matters in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State must explain why he should have chosen Tuesday afternoons for further meetings of the Committee. The way he put it, which was simply that he understood this to be convenient to everybody—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For 13 years it has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the way he briefly introduced his Motion. I remember long discussions on this subject in the past, when the Committee has not suddenly said, "Yes, Tuesday afternoon is the time" and dealt with the matter in about two minutes at the beginning of a meeting. During the last five years, this has always been a matter of considerable controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not among hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Govan has pointed out from the other side of the Committee that Tuesdays are generally busy days, and this I well understand. The hon. Member described the position very well. He also suggested meeting on Fridays. It may well be that, when my right hon. Friend has tabled his Amendments, we shall find that that is one of the possibilities which we shall have to discuss. Friday forenoons are, of course, not so easy for many Scottish Members. I myself would be in favour of Friday Sittings—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But if it is difficult to have a Friday morning Sitting in Westminster, would it not be possible to have it in Glasgow or Edinburgh—especially Glasgow? Would that make it easier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting suggestion, though I have an idea that you, Mr. Steele, may well think that that suggestion goes beyond the
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
terms of the Motion which we have under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules of the House might have to be changed if we decided that we were going to sit on a Friday, but I should not mind sitting on a Friday morning. So far as distances are concerned, I know that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), and the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), travel 600 and more miles to their constituencies and travelling the 200 miles north of Edinburgh and Glasgow very often takes more time than the rest. Therefore, Fridays would have their difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because, however, of the importance of this Bill, and because my constituents would fully realise how important it is, I would not raise that as an objection. All these days would have some difficulties for hon. Members, but the most difficult time for all would probably be Tuesday afternoons, for the reasons which I have given. Therefore I hope that the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State will later on give us much more cogent reasons. We know that he speaks with cogency when he wants to. As well as his fresh outlook on things, we know how vigorously and cogently he can put arguments. So we hope to hear him before this discussion is completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for having had a moment or two to think, though I am not certain that during the period that I have been thinking it has really helped either you, Mr. Steele, or myself to listen very carefully to what was being said at the time. This is inherently one of the difficulties of this type of procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment which I would seek to move is to delete first from the Motion
	<br><blockquote><p>"this day at Four o'clock, on Tuesday, 27th April at Four o'clock".</p></blockquote>
and then the further reference to 4 o'clock on Tuesdays. By consequential Amendments we should insert instead possible alternative times which the Committee might well like to consider and discuss, such as Wednesday morning at 10.30, Monday morning at 10.30, Friday morning at 10.30, or, alternatively, Tuesdays and Thursday at 10.30 p.m., by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
which time the House has normally finished its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shall I continue speaking now, Mr. Steele, or would you like to propose a Question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving his first Amendment I think the right hon. Gentleman could raise the other matters which he has mentioned. I should have no objection to his doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, if that Amendment is discussed and accepted does that mean that no Amendments for other possible meeting times would be capable of being considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must wait and see what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I get this quite clear? What exactly is the Amendment? Surely there ought to be something specific, with some alternative specified time and day. It is no good having a series of alternatives. The alternative must be put down in an Amendment in black and white, so we can see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help the Committee and I hope that the Committee will help me. The right hon. Gentleman is now going to move his first Amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which is to leave out "this day at Four o'clock", on "Tuesday, 27th April, at Four o'clock".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the discussion on this Amendment, it seems to me that it would be for the convenience of the Committee to discuss the general proposition of Sitting on a Tuesday afternoon, or whatever other alternatives hon. Members may have. I am saying, in effect, that I would have no objection to this being done because, in my view, this would lead to an orderly debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry to take up time, but I am rather confused about the present position. I understood my right hon. Friend to say that he had some five possible Amendments; I think he suggested various times. What I am not quite clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
about is whether on this Amendment we can rove, as it were, over the alternative times of sitting which my right hon. Friend suggested, or whether we are restricted to a debate about Tuesday afternoon and the virtues or unvirtues of sitting at the times proposed by the hon. Gentleman opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help the Committee by making the position clear. The right hon. Gentleman will move his first Amendment, and it seems to me that, for the purpose of having an orderly debate without continual interruptions by the Chair in trying to keep the debate on one particular point, it would be much better to have a general debate on the right hon. Gentleman's first Amendment. I have no objection, now that he has given an indication of what he has in mind, to these matters being discussed on the first Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put one further point? If this is to be the order of procedure—in other words, if we are to have a general debate on one specific Amendment—then I take it that you, Mr. Steele, will put subsequent Amendments formally without debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, the Committee has only one Amendment before it. I have chosen my words carefully, in saying that I would have no objection to the other matters being discussed with this Amendment, because I think this would be for the convenience of the Committee. The question of whether or not the other Amendments would be selected will be a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to trouble you again on a point of order, Mr. Steele, but this is a valid and important point. May we assume that a debate, as it were, on the generality of the Amendment which is now to be proposed by my right hon. Friend, will not be taken by the Chair as precluding debate on the particular later on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that I would prefer the general debate to take place on the first Amendment. I am indicating to the Committee that I have no objection to these other matters
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
being considered with the first Amendment, because this, in my view, would lead to an orderly debate. I have selected my words with care, because the question of the selection of the other Amendments is a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Steele, the point which you have made, and which was also in my mind, in dealing with this rather complicated procedure, which from time to time lands itself on our plate, is probably the right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having read with some care through the earlier precedents, one is aware of the difficulty both to hon. Members and to the Chair if debates take place on manuscript Amendments. The Minister of State, probably following precedents in former days, was kind enough to give me the proposed Sittings Motion a minute or two before the Committee started, but any Amendments which I or my hon. Friends or hon. Gentlemen opposite may wish to put down can only be put down at the last moment, and so the whole Committee cannot have time to see them. The effect of this is that you, Mr. Steele, would like the debate on this first Amendment which I have proposed to cover the alternatives which hon. Gentlemen have in mind of sitting at different times on different days, because these, in a sense, are all relative to the general question of the Sittings Motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that, if the Committee decides to accept the Sittings Motion as it is, or to vary it in accordance with the arguments put forward on one side of the Committee or the other, we shall have an opportunity—and in my view this is quite separate—of discussing whether or not it is right for the Government to ask this Committee to sit a third time during the week at this stage of the Bill. This seems to me to be quite a separate question from the alternatives. Perhaps I may have your Ruling on that, Mr. Steele, because it does affect the way in which the debate is conducted on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My own view at this stage is that we really should try to have a general debate bringing in the matters which the right hon. Gentleman has mentioned. At the moment all the other Amendments are not before me, and I cannot rule on them. I was hoping to
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
have an opportunity to look at these while the Committee was discussing other matters. At the moment, at first glance, it seems to me that these other Amendments will not be selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that you, Mr. Steele, have obviously got to think about them, and make up your mind, as it is your duty to do, which other Amendments you may or may not select, but the point I was trying to get clear at this stage was whether, the Committee having decided one way or the other on the Amendment, there would then be a debate on the main Question. If that were so, it would seem right and for the convenience of the Committee that we should keep out of the first debate the question of why the Government are asking for a third Sitting a week at this stage of the Committee. The Government could then explain to us the reasons why they think that a third Sitting a week is necessary at this stage, and we could have our last debate, if that happened, on that particular single aspect of this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always the desire of the Chair to keep the discussion on an Amendment to the particular subject of the Amendment—but most Chairmen find that this is very difficult. I think that what the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting would be very difficult for me to do, and this is why I thought, because I have no desire to be continually interrupting Members, that I would suggest to the Committee that I have no objection to this matter being discussed in the general debate. Let us see how we go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Steele. With respect, I think that it would be perfectly simple to have a debate on the alternatives and on the question whether it is necessary at all for a third Sitting a week, the question which has led to the debate having taken place at all. If, as you say, Mr. Steele, you wish to see how we go, I will, at least in my first speech to the Committee, keep off the question of a third Sitting at this point, so that I can make the point later, if that tends to be the way in which the debate goes.

Searching for wisdom through the past records of this Committee I came, in due course, to the debate on the Housing (Scotland) Bill on 20th and 22nd February, 1962. I think this was the last occasion on which in this Committee a Sittings Motion was moved and Amendments moved to it. I was interested in some of the debates that took place. I was also disappointed when I read some of the things that were said. The rather slow start to the proceedings this morning was due to an attempt to try to avoid a repetition of what happened in 1962.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by a statement by the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Secretary of State for Scotland. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I see no reason why we should depart from the normal procedure of meeting in the morning. That is the proper thing to do."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 305.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to make various other remarks which would be very pertinent to what, I feel, is the second half of this debate. Later on he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There has been no consultation about this. I do not suppose we should have agreed to it, but it would have been nice to have been asked."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 306.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) who was the Opposition Scottish Whip at the time, and therefore part of what is euphemistically known as "the usual channels", said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here I must express my resentment."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman speaks always with great moderation, and if he was expressing his resentment, the Committee will realise that he felt very strongly about it. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I resent the fact that no attempt was made to meet us and to discuss with us the possibility of having an extra Sitting."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 22nd February, 1962; c. 357.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know how parties change when they move from Opposition to Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member knows now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and I am watching with a certain amount of amazement some of the changes which have come over hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite. The fact is—this is part of the trouble in
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
which, inevitably, we have been put by the way in which the Government have handled this question—I was told through the usual channels late on Wednesday evening that the Minister of State was going to put down a Sittings Motion for a third Sitting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that on Thursday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We were told there was a Sittings Motion to be put down, but no attempt was made to discuss it. I dare say that hon. Members opposite had a long discussion about this and decided that this was the time that suited them best—I do not know—but no attempt was made to discuss with us first, whether there was a need for a third Sitting, and secondly, when it should be. In the light of what hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have said in the past over and over again, about trying to get smoother co-operation with the Government side, as we were in 1962, it seems to me that, when they become the Government, what they have said before is thrown straight out of the window. One is therefore bound to suspect that they are not really interested in trying to get the help and co-operation of hon. Members on this side of the Committee in getting the work done. That is the greatest possible pity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though hon. Members on this side of the Committee have strong reservations about certain parts of this Bill there are other portions of it that we want. So far as I am able to understand from the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) the Liberal party has rather less reservations, although there may be some, about the present form of the Bill; but the hon. Gentleman also wishes to get a considerable amount of the Bill on to the Statute Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting and relevant to note that of the debates which have so far taken place on this Bill the great majority of the columns of HANSARD which have been filled were not filled by the speeches of my hon. Friends. I do not say that this is a good or a bad thing: I am merely stating a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Steele, suggested that it would at least be in order for me to mention the alternative times, or some of them, which I have put forward for the Government to consider. I wish to say a little
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
about the alternative times. Probably my hon. Friends will have their own views, and perhaps some hon. Gentlemen opposite have not changed their views just because their party is now in Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us what specific Amendment he is moving, so that we may debate that proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to tell the hon. Gentelman the specific Amendment which I am moving, but as you have said, Mr. Steele, the fact that I am moving a specific Amendment does not mean that I cannot indicate to the Committee the other items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific Amendment, which I move, as an Amendment to the Motion, is to leave out the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this day at four o'clock, on Tuesday, 27th April, at Four o'clock".</p></blockquote>
There are consequential Amendments to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past—and it was clearly indicated in the first few words which I heard this morning while I was trying to work out what Amendments I ought to put down to the Motion—there always has been as there is now on the part of the Opposition of whatever party, and of some hon. Members opposite still, the strongest possible objection to meeting in the afternoons when the House is sitting. The reason is quite clear. Naturally, the Opposition does not wish to meet then and perhaps its reluctance is stronger than that of hon. Members on the Government side. There are important debates which take place on Tuesday afternoons in the House. Mention has been made of the one this afternoon. This happens almost constantly though the whole of the Parliamentary Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost inevitable that Members of the Opposition will have stronger reasons for being in the Chamber to put points of view on behalf of their constituents, or their own views, on many things which the Government are doing and which hon. Members on this side of the Committee feel are wrong, or would be harmful to their constituents. It is possible—though normally not very popular with the Whips—for Government supporters to criticise the Government. Perhaps the Government Whips are content that a good many of their wilder charac-
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
ters should be locked up in a Committee during Tuesday afternoons and consequently not able to criticise things which the Government Whips do not want hon. Members to criticise in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that if we sat at 4 o'clock on Tuesday there is no reason whatever, why the Sitting should not continue right through to 1 o'clock in the morning on Wednesday, so that an enormous amount of time could be taken up at the whim of the Government, by making hon. Members work, in effect, from 10.30 in the morning on Tuesday till 1 o'clock in the morning on Wednesday—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And beyond that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—with suitable moments for a little light refreshment. This is not necessarily the right way for the Committee to conduct its business. I am perfectly well aware of the arguments put forward in the past by my hon. Friends and the reasons for them, because then we were in Government, but I seriously feel that this is not the best way to conduct our business. A great many columns in HANSARD have been filled in the past by hon. Members opposite stating that the reason my hon. Friends did not want to work in the morning, outside Tuesdays and Thursdays, was they had a great deal of business to attend to of one sort or another, and I will not go into that in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and myself are perfectly willing to offer to the Government a series of morning Sittings and I will come to that in a moment. We are well aware that at this stage, when Members of Parliament are being paid a considerably increased salary, we have a certain duty to the public to be seen to be working hard, and, I hope, effectively. This seems to me very much in line with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) during a debate on the Housing (Scotland) Bill, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have always taken the view that in the House of Commons we ought to set an example to the outside world."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February 1962, c. 338.]</p></blockquote>
On that occasion the hon. Member was moving an Amendment to the effect that the Committee should sit at 9 o'clock
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
or 9.30 in the morning, and he explained to the Committee the embarrassment he felt at coming to work at 10.30 a.m. That may have been an embarrassment to the hon. Gentleman from time to time. It is true that the general public may notice that we come to work at 10.30 a.m., but it does not always notice the time when we knock off. I think that hon. Members do work very long hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to the immediate point of my Amendment, it is to suggest to the Government that there are alernatives which could get us out of this genuine and serious difficulty regarding meeting at the same time as the House is sitting. The days which have proved most popular in the past have been either Wednesdays or Thursdays. The Government have made it a little more difficult to be entirely logical in an argument about Wednesday mornings this time, because they have brought on to the Floor of the House a Bill of which they are a little ashamed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition did that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government chose the time at which the Bill should be debated. Clearly, the Government were a little ashamed that they were not the official "fathers" of the Bill, and I suppose that, in the view of the Government, it is still a Private Member's Bill. I think, therefore, though they have done some damage to the argument that this Committee should meet on Wednesday mornings, despite the important Bill being discussed on the Floor of the House, I think that probably Wednesday is the best alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) made a plea at the beginning of the debate for Sittings on Fridays. I know what a keen attender at the House on Fridays the hon. Member is. There may be other hon. Members on either side of the Committee who would prefer to sit on Fridays, but we are all practical, sensible people and we appreciate that a great many hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have commitments in their constituencies. Some of them like to travel overnight by train, and I have observed that others prefer to fly to their constituencies on Friday mornings, so that a meeting of this Committee on Friday mornings
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
could be awkward for them. I think that all hon. Members who are Members of the Committee should have a chance to express their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has seriously suggested whether Monday might be a good day. On Mondays one comes back fresh and full of nice Scots air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Scots wind, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that it would not be impossible for the officers of the House—and the many people who form what I might call the infrastructure of our Committee—if we were to meet on Mondays at 10.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my hon. Friends and I consider that the Committee should meet on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, but not till 10.30 p.m.; that is, after the main Divisions have taken place in the House. We appreciate that this would add to the length of the day, although not necessarily so because even if we meet at 4 p.m. we are still able to go through to 1 o'clock the following morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman consider that meeting at 10.30 p.m. and working on through the night will enable hon. Members to do justice to their constituents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it would not be easy for hon. Members, after having worked for two and a half hours in Committee in the morning, having then proceeded with the other business in the House until 10.30 p.m., then to return again to Committee to continue the day. I agree that it is not desirable that we should do business in that way. That is why I am amazed that the Minister of State should suggest that we ought to meet at 4 p.m., which will entail our going right through to 1 o'clock in the morning, if the Minister so desires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the right hon. Gentleman keep referring to 1 o'clock in the morning? The Standing Orders do not provide for Committees to terminate at that hour. The right hon. Gentleman may recall a famous point of order which was once raised on this matter. He should be aware that the Committee is able to go straight through, even till
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
1 o'clock the next afternoon. It is entirely unrestricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having consulted the appropriate authorities, I am told that to rise at 1 a.m. is the normal practice for late Committee Sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. The right hon. Gentleman should attend more Standing Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that it is the normal practice to adjourn at 1 a.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not and it never has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If what the Minister says is correct then he is making his case even worse than it already is. I was taking my information from the normal source, based on the practice of previous Committees. I was not expecting the hon. Gentleman to be daft about this—but his hon. Friends know him a great deal better than I do, and I am prepared to accept their view of his capacity. I have given the Committee the substance of our ideas on this point. I have kept off the question altogether of whether a third Sitting is necessary, because if the debate goes in that direction I will have something to say on that topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could you guide me on a question of procedure in Committee, Mr. Steele? Frankly, it seems to me that there is a shocking waste of time in the Committee this morning, for us to be discussing even such a Motion as this, and the Amendments about which we have so far heard. I am not suggesting that such discussion is out of order; merely that it is a shocking waste of time that we should be proceeding in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assumed that the hon. Member was seeking my advice on a point of order. I am wondering what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, but it will take me a wee while to come to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Usually a point of order is brief and to the point. Is the hon. Member rising to a point of order or making a speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making a speech, Mr. Steele.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not at a Glasgow Corporation meeting. I have said that I will not give way, and that is that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But this is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why I sought your advice, Mr. Steele, is that as a back bencher I have been staggered by the way the discussion has gone this morning and by the lack of consideration that has been given to new hon. Members. Before I decide to conform to the Parliamentary game I would like some better explanations from my hon. Friend the Minister of State about why it is necessary to have even one extra Sitting. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] It is all very well for hon. Gentlemen opposite to cheer, but they are partly responsible for the position in which the Committee finds itself. I wonder what our constituents in the Highlands and Islands and all the counties concerned in the matters raised by the Bill would say if they could be here and listen to the way the debate has gone this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy MacLean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They can read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be obliged for a fuller explanation from the Minister; for example, some idea of the approximate timetable he is trying to achieve. I do not wish to make party points at the moment. I am not accepting any responsibility for what might or might not have been said by some of my hon. Friends in February, 1962, or on any other occasion. Just because the Parliamentary game has proceeded along certain lines all these years that is no reason why I should accept it and join in it now. It perturbs me that we should have had no indication from the Minister about what is to be included in the Bill following the hours we spent discussing the difference between economy and industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had nothing from the Minister at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Gentlemen are sincere, that is one thing, but if they are wasting time because they want to block the Bill—[HON.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Surely there should be some relationship between the content of the hon. Gentleman's speech and fact. He has suggested that there is an attempt to block the Bill, which is a monstrous accusation, in view of the time that has been taken up by hon. Members opposite. Is that not so Mr. Steele?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One at a time, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pointing out, Mr. Steele, that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Mac-Arthur) claimed that he was rising to a point of order. He has not made one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already indicated that it was not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that a lot of this has been, from the point of view of hon. Gentlemen opposite, a lot of publicity because the issue raised by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble)—to the effect that because Parliamentary salaries have gone up we should work harder—has no bearing on our proceedings in the Committee. After all, what have hon. Gentleman opposite been doing in the past? This has not relationship to the salary. We are here to do a job, and it has not struck fe that we have been doing it. This may apply to some of my hon. Friends as well as to hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to you, Mr. Steele, to guide me as to whether there is any reason why we cannot take votes sooner than we have been doing so that we may proceed with the work we are here to do. I also appeal to the Minister to give us a better
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
idea of and to take us into his confidence about the timetable he has in mind. I do not have a copy of the Motion or of any Amendments to it before me. A trade union branch meeting would certainly not put up with this sort of thing. I see no need for additional Sittings if they are to be utilised by time-wasting discussion. My reaction at the moment is that I would rather try to get off this Committee than have to sit here listening to hon. Members blethering about things which are of no consequence to our constituents and which do not represent the work we should be doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for calling me, Mr. Steele, because this is the first time I have addressed this Committee on this Bill. I speak, therefore, as one who cannot be held in any way responsible for the long time that has been spent on the Bill. I say at the outset that I appreciate the courage of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) for saying the things which he just said. I believe that he was voicing opinions which are widely held on both sides of the Committee. The situation which we face in the Committee today is only a symptom of a long-standing malady of proceedings in this Committee, from what I gather. I intend to say something which I hope is thoroughly in order and, while I may be presumptuous in saying this, I think that I may be speaking for a large number of newer hon. Members who joined Parliament in the last few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go into the question of who has been responsible for the long time that has been taken so far in considering the Bill because that would be contentious and could be argued till the cows come home. I have gone to considerable trouble in making calculations about the proceedings in the Committee. It is perfectly clear that the speeches from hon. Members opposite have occupied about 124 columns in HANSARD, while the speeches from hon. Members on this side of the Committee have occupied 99 columns. The speeches of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston)—and we are none of us very sure which side of the Committee he is on—have occupied 24 columns. I make no criticism about this. I am merely showing that, unless I have done my calculation wrongly, hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>
opposite have spoken at a length to occupy 124 columns in HANSARD, while my hon. Friends have spoken at a length to occupy 99 columns. We can, therefore, start from there. Incidentally, if we are looking for records hon. Members may be interested to know that the longest speech on record in the Committee so far has come from the benches opposite, from the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And it concerned the Western Isles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is blaming the hon. Gentleman for being concerned and for expressing to the fullest possible advantage the views and needs of his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have adduced these figures merely to show that it is absolutely no use anyone trying to make out that the Opposition has been delaying or dawdling on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with a great deal of what the hon. Gentleman has said, and the fresh and courageous way in which he has said it, may I ask him one question? Does he really think that silence is a sign of common sense in a Committee of this sort and when dealing with a Bill of this kind and this importance? Is he really saying that silence is a sign of common sense and wisdom and all the rest of it in these circumstances? He cannot go as far as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is further than it is possible to get from my idea. No one should be expected to maintain silence, although I will come to that matter shortly. I said that I was not criticising the hon. Gentleman. He has every right to be keen about the provisions of the Bill.

The next thing is that I believe that this Committee has in the House of Commons and in Parliamentary affairs generally a certain reputation which is not altogether to the honour of those who sit on the Committee, because, rightly or wrongly, fairly or unfairly, we in this Committee have a reputation for excessive length, excessive tediousness and excessive repetition in the speeches we make. I am quite deliberately not
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
looking at anybody in particular. I am not trying to make any particular accusation against anyone on either side of the Committee, but I would suggest that this morning, in this discussion of the Sittings Motion brought in by the hon. Gentleman, we have an opportunitly to look at ourselves with a very critical eye. I feel that Members on both sides who feel this way should unite to change the order of things in the way this Committee conducts its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have far shorter speeches—and my strictures on this would not be confined only to this Committee, but to other Committees of the House, too. Really, if we look with anything like an unbiassed eye at any of the speeches made in this Committee it is absolutely clear that the points in them could be made very easily in ten minutes, when the speeches very often take twenty or even thirty. I cannot see that this adds to the value of the discussion of the Motions and the Bills which come before us. It does nothing but delay proceedings. It gives a bad impression to those who read about them and to those who come to the public gallery. Surprisingly enough, very few of them do, but it gives a bad impression to them, and when it comes to people in Scotland asking themselves what their representatives are doing, quite frankly, if they read the OFFICIAL REPORT, or full accounts printed in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> or the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> they cannot fail to get the impression that we are an absolute waste of time and a talking shop which cannot do the simplest thing quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that I could very well be accused, if I went on for much longer, of delaying the Bill myself. I therefore do not wish to deain the Committee at this moment for very much longer. If I should be accused of being a little impatient, I hope hon. Gentlemen will remember that I have listened in comparative silence for six months now to the proceedings of this Committee. I have not rushed in baldheaded, as a supposed new broom, to step in where angels fear to tread. I have listened long and carefully and with the utmost compassion to what goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot possibly avoid coming to the conclusion that we need a radical change in the way we conduct our business, and I suggest that anyone who feels indignant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
about this and feels I am overstating the case should sit down and look at his own speeches to see if he could not cut them in half perfectly simply. I have, in my comparatively short life so far, been used to doing things as much as possible and not talking about them for too long. I feel we could very easily, if we really got down to it, get through this Bill in under ten Sittings, and if there were no repetition and waste of time this could be done. I do appeal to any of the new or back benchers in this Committee who may feel similarly to take their courage in their hands and back me up in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way for just a moment? Since he has a good deal of outside and business experience, and his estimate of ten Sittings for the Committee may be quite realistic, would he not agree that the time which things take is very often due to the fact that the Minister in charge refuses to accept good arguments both from his own side and from this side, and goes on stalling, without giving the Committee any reason why he will not accept them? Does my hon. Friend not think this itself is often a cause of the delay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my right hon. Friend has a very good point, and I think we ought to bear in mind that this has gone on for a considerable length of time. I think we should certainly accept that if a little more give and take were shown by Members on either side of this Committee at any time in the future, or had been at any time in the past—and I am deliberately not trying to point a finger—the Minister in charge of the Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know far more about this procedure than the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman knows far more about Parliamentary proceedings than I. He has been here for years and years and I have been here only for six months. I only know of the hon. Gentleman's activities in Opposition, from what I have been told, and what I have been told may be very inaccurate. All I can say is that I hope, from my opinion of the hon. Gentleman's speed and verve, that it is inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
On the point that my right hon. Friend raised, of course he is absolutely right that if there were much more give and take, if there were much quicker willingness of the Minister to accept Amendments which are perfectly in order, very often they could be disposed of in ten minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a point here and I think I am voicing the feelings of a lot of Members on both sides who feel this is a problem which must be tackled, and tackled now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This sort of thing can carry itself to extremes of illogicality, and it is the easiest thing in the world to get up and talk of Parliament as a talking shop but if it is not intended to be a talking shop, what on earth is it? Its very name of Parliament makes it this by definition. Otherwise what is it for? If it is not a talking shop, will the hon. Gentleman tell us what its purpose is? It is the easiest thing in the world for me to appreciate all the frustrations of new Members. We have all felt them. I cannot remember very clearly the first six months of my own lengthening parliamentary career—it is not so easy any more—but it is quite easy to understand the frustrations expressed by the hon. Gentleman. On the other hand, if the course which the two new Members who have just spoken advocate were carried to its extreme, there would be no proper consideration for Members' views and Amendments. We would have Ministers simply rejecting views, when expressed at all, or merely accepting automatically Amendments of all kinds, some possibly very good, some probably equally bad. But some excellent Amendments might as likely be rejected just because of lack of debate and proper consideration. Thus, if we are not a debating shop, a talking shop, it remains to be asked what on earth are we here for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made in my time quite a lot of speeches and some very long ones. I think I am guilty of having made the longest of all Parliamentary speeches in this century. I am sorry that I had to inflict it on other people, but I am un-apologetic in my view that it was inflicted on the House in a good cause. At the end of the day, my constituents supported me; and the House generally by its later modifications of the Bill approved what I was doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
We sat on the Committee stage of that Bill—the Crofters (Scotland) Bill, at 10.30 a.m., at 4 o'clock or later, after 7 o'clock. We have often sat in this Committee much later than 7 o'clock. On the Crofters Bill Committee there were 29 Sittings, some early, some late into the evenings. We on this side found nothing really serious to complain of that in order to get a Bill through in face of what the Tory Government wrongly regarded as unreasonable opposition, we had to sit on Tuesday and other afternoons. Even with some Sittings up to 10, 11 and even near 12 o'clock at night, nobody pleaded he was too jaded and none of the objections the hon. Gentleman has suddenly found to one Sitting on Tuesday afternoon each week were regarded as valid at all these days even by himself. Therefore, the precedents are there, and the Tories are very normally guided by precedent. Traditionally, they fall back on precedent. The right hon. Gentleman may not at that time have been Secretary of State for Scotland. In any case, the Labour Party, I must say, did not raise very strong objections to extra Tuesday Sittings. We thought it was, above all, important to examine the Bill in detail and oppose certain parts of it. The Crofters Bill was, in certain respects, a bad Bill; but it was a much better Bill when we had finished with it. People in the Highlands and Islands certainly agreed that it was a much better Bill after 29 long Sittings, and that without that effort it would have been a much worse Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I myself have certainly spoken several times on this Bill. The hon. Gentleman, the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) is most welcome to speak. I like to hear his voice; he puts his case with freshness, clarity and a certain logic which is very difficult to resist. But on the other hand he must not merely attack procedure; he must make a contribution. The sure way to get bored in a Committee is to take no part in the work of that Committee. This is not a boring place, the House of Commons, or Parliament, or the Committees of Parliament. If one is in a Committee on should be a working Member on that Committee and the only civilised way to work in Committee is to talk and to argue, to put Amendments and vote on Amendments. That is the work of the Committee. What
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
other work are we here to perform? I would really like to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now the hon. Gentleman says that in his experience he has always been giving orders which were always carried out by someone. But this is exactly why Tories produce such rotten legislation. Lord Randolph Churchill said many years ago, that the Tory Party can govern, it can raise taxation endlessly, and it can make war; but it cannot legislate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Member is going a bit far now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I am not going nearly far enough in my criticism; but I accept your Ruling with respect. I was merely quoting Randolph Churchill's views. Surely I have not gone too far in quoting Randolph Churchill in his better days against the Tory Party. But there it is, the Tory Party love to give orders; they expect things to be done just because they demand it. But Parliament is an exercise in persuasion, debate, argument. It is not a place in which you get away easily with what you want by just giving orders. That is why, Mr. Steele, all through the years retired Tory admirals and generals have made extremely bad Ministers of War and Defence. They expect orders to be carried out instead of having to present an argument and have it carried by persuasion and argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Member must relate his speech to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is not relevant to what the hon. Gentleman said a few minutes ago I do not know what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman misrepresented what I said. I did not say that I have been used to giving orders and having them carried out. I said I was used to doing things and not talking about them, which is quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, Mr. Steele, shows the impossibility of arguing with the Tories about Parliamentary procedure and proceedings. The hon. Gentleman in his speech, which was quite in order, I presume, said he was used to having things carried out and things being done when he wanted them to be done. I do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
not know what sort of things the hon. Gentleman has in mind when he talks of getting things done in Parliament without properly discussing them. What are we here for? How do we legislate without discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I would want to do would be to interrupt the hon. Gentleman in making a perfectly reasonable speech, but he is misrepresenting facts when he says I have sat back all my life and got other people to do things. Anyone who knows me will know that that is quite untrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that at all; but what I do suggest is that the hon. Gentleman would not do well to apply his political philosophy and very different former experience to Parliamentary procedure and Parliamentary work where of course he has a right to say he is still a little out of his depth. This is admittedly, for him, a new procedure and something to which the hon. Gentleman has not been accustomed. I hope it is not seriously implied in what he said that he does not want to become accustomed to it; for if this is so he knows what to do. Does Parliament reform itself radically for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman, or should the hon. Gentleman reform himself? If the hon. Gentleman wants an argument on the axiom about the part being less than the whole, we might enjoy such an argument; but I do not think he would carry it. He has every right to try as part of his training: but that is another point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the important things for hon. Members of the House is that they should be able to consult their constituents and it is highly important that we should be able to consult occasionally in person in the course of debating a Bill running over several weeks of Parliamentary time. This is important for every Member. Every Member who wants to take part in legislation should be as much as possible in touch with local opinion, with the opinions of his constituents about a Bill, if he is taking the job, and them, seriously. Indeed, one of my difficulties is that I am not able to go as often as I would like to my constituency. I can get to most parts of Scotland; but I dare not always go across the Minch because there is always the danger of not getting back for a Monday. It must be
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
remembered that some of us have very long distances to travel—which takes time—if we want to meet our constituents and consult them and hear their point of view. We can talk endlessly here; but they still have the right to talk to us in the constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Gentleman will agree with me on this point, and so will my hon. Friend the Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)—that the objections to our procedure and also the offerings we have had today of other days and midnight Sittings as alternatives to the Minister's suggested timetable for the Committee do not meet the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were offered, by one hon. Member for example, the fag end of the week, Friday, for discussion of what ought to be the priority business in the weekly timetable of Scottish Members, that is our Scottish legislation. We were offered his services at the fag end of the evenings by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) which is not much of an offer to our Scottish people and constituencies either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, myself, if we are going to start suggesting amendments in the meetings timetable, we should offer to start each Monday morning, coming here at eight or nine o'clock. I certainly would have no objection. I do not, however, think the fag end of the week is the right time. I would prefer the beginning of the week, when everybody is fresh. Surely that is the best time. I would say that, and also Tuesday morning. But, surely we are still in reasonable shape by Tuesday afternoon. Does anyone seriously feel he is completely jaded in nerves and eloquence by the afternoon of Tuesday, the second day of the working week? In a five day week, nobody should feel quite so utterly exhausted. I do not see where the argument of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Argyll takes us. If we start telling people we are exhausted after two and a half hours' work on a Tuesday morning, only having worked on Monday morning before that, we are pretty poor members. People have no right to plead they are too tired by Tuesday afternoon; but if they really cannot carry on for two and a half hours longer by Tuesday, there is something seriously wrong with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, the Minister has only proposed something which has been done before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
on many occasions and, indeed, done by the party opposite. Surely that appeals to hon. Gentlemen's vanity, even if not to their logic and consistency. I hesitate to appeal to them on those grounds. If we look at Wednesday this session, we are right into a Committee in the mornings which should be absorbing at least some time and attention from hon. Members of the House. When we come to Friday, we are always in Private Members' time. When we come to Thursday mornings, we are, of course, involved in this Committee anyway, so that really leaves us as far as mornings are concerned only Monday as a reasonable proposition. I have no objection to meeting on Monday. I think we should meet on Monday; it would do us all a lot of good. By Friday, I think we are all just a little bit fed up and people have some right to feel fed up with Committee work by Friday. I have already given also the reason against Fridays that hon. Members should be able to go off to consult their constituents and that some of us have to go long distances to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a precedent for Tuesday afternoon sittings is required, hon. Members opposite themselves have created it. I need hardly mention again that there was no real objection from those of us who sat Tuesday afternoons and evenings, to get the Crofters Bill, which was in many ways a similar Measure, to this, relating to the same areas through the Committee. I see no reason why hon. Members opposite, who imposed additional sittings on the Committee then, should find it so unreasonable or unworkable to do the same thing now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Munro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support a great deal of what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) and by the hon. Members for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm Mac-Millan) and Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) about brevity, but I want to revert to the point of whether we are to meet on Tuesday afternoons or Wednesday mornings or even earlier on other days of the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With many of my hon. Friends on this side, I am perturbed about the Murder, (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, which is now before the House on Wednesday mornings. With Amendments and
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
speeches, we are doing our best to improve or to delay it. On balance, however, it would seem to me to be better to forgo our presence in the Chamber on Wednesday morning rather than give up our presence in the Chamber on Tuesday afternoon and evening. That was very much the line taken by hon. Members opposite on the Housing (Scotland) Bill in February, 1962.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were no Wednesday Sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that occasion, the right hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison), who is now Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, moved an Amendment to resist Tuesday afternoon in favour of Wednesday morning Sittings. The right hon. Lady pointed out that the Bill had not been taking a long time, that hon. Members had the right to speak, and that there had been no filibustering. Those points are all appropriate today. Hon. Members have not spent unduly long on the Clauses of the Bill which we have discussed so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady, however, went on to say that she was not enthusiastic about Tuesday afternoon Sittings and that hon. Members opposite
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider our duties on the Floor of the House of such importance that we are proposing that, instead of meeting on Tuesday afternoons, we ought to meet on Wednesday mornings."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Stainding Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 288.]</p></blockquote>
I support the right hon. Lady in that and I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) when he suggests an Amendment to that effect today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a degree of difference of opinion on the occasion in 1962 to which I have referred, because the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) opposed the Amendment by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I want to speak against the Amendment because I do not want to sit on Wednesday mornings. When we come to the subsequent debate I will show why I do not want to sit on Tuesday afternoons either. I do not go on shopping expeditions, nor do many of my hon. Friends. Nevertheless, we have got other commitments in the House, which we must have the opportunity to deal with."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 297.]</p></blockquote>
That is very true. Tuesday afternoon is of extreme importance, particularly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
today, when we are to have a debate on the TSR2, which has important effects for Scotland. Many good Scots are employed at the Ferranti works in Edinburgh. They will have their jobs in serious jeopardy, if they have not lost them, by the end of the debate tonight. We Scots should be there supporting Ferranti and the TSR2, but if we sit here this evening we shall not be able to take part in the debate on the Floor of the House. A week ago today, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), who has now left the Committee, spoke on the expanding aircraft industry. I hope that he will be in the House this afternoon to speak about the expanding aircraft industry as it affects Scotland and the TSR2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on the Sittings Motion in 1962 occupied the whole two hours and a half, with 19,000 words and 27 points of order by hon. Members opposite. That is something which, I hope, will not occur today, because we want the Bill to make progress, provided that some of our constructive Amendments are accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite wrong for the Minister of State to indicate that progress is unduly slow. That is not at all true. It is interesting to remember what the hon. Gentleman himself said in 1962 when he complained about my hon. Friend the then Under-Secretary moving a Sittings Motion. The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this anxiety to get the Bill through, the Under-Secretary has not the vision to see that it is possible to do so without meeting on Tuesday afternoons. … Why do we not meet at seven o'clock on Thursday morning, just to show willing?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 332.]</p></blockquote>
That was one constructive suggestion made by the hon. Member that morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not to accept Wednesday morning sittings at 10.30 I am sure that we on this side would be quite prepared to meet earlier on Tuesday or Thursday mornings. I strongly oppose the proposal to meet on Tuesday afternoons. To that end, I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll in resisting Tuesday afternoon and supporting Wednesday morning sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a word or two in support of a large part
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
of what my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) has said. This is not a Sunday school treat. We get an awful lot of humbug talked about delaying Bills. The whole point of an Opposition is to oppose the Government and to present alternatives. One of the great disadvantages of the present Opposition is that they have no policies. They do not know where they are going, they have no leader, and this is why they are in the shambles they are. One appreciates the frustration of their new Members coming in. They do not know what they are doing, why they are here or what they are doing when they are here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government come along and say that they will get their legislation, and get it by means which might not be attractive to the Opposition, hon. Members opposite should not object to that. It is just a change of geographical location in the Committee, and this alters one's views of things. It applies to both sides. I have no doubt that there has been a good deal of time wasting in the Committee, but there always is. It depends on how one looks at it. If one's own side is producing arguments, they are qualitative, pertinent arguments. If the other side advances arguments which one does not like, one's views change; that is filibustering and wasting time. It is virtually impossible for party politicians, who are by definition prejudiced, to take an objective view of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government of the day must at all times make the decision. They are the masters and they have to decide how and when they shall get their legislation. And we will get this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Member's point about politicians not always being objective, but I am thrown back to some very clear words of his during the debate in 1962. The hon. Member said very clearly—and this was not I am sure being unobjective:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not want to meet a third time during the week. It is a shocking commentary on the business acumen of hon. Members if things cannot be arranged to get our legislation through under the agreed timetable without this kind of threat hanging over us all the time."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee, </i> 20th February, 1962; c. 295.]</p></blockquote>
I am sure that that was said sincerely. I hope that in his expression of opinion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
to the Committee today the hon. Member will tell us whether meeting a third time during the week has now become more pleasant to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had answered that point before the right hon. Gentleman rose, by saying that one's geographical" disposition in the Committee altered one's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, a third Sitting inconveniences somebody somewhere all the time. I suppose that any Sitting inconveniences Members. I recall the violent opposition to any suggestion of Wednesday morning Sittings by hon. Members opposite when they were in Government on the ground that they had to make a living outside. That was the main objection on that ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were non-partisan—there are all kinds of "ifs"—if we were a church congregation with a minister of the church, instead of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, sitting there with a cup of tea, of course we could arrange these things. We could have our Bill in one afternoon. But it does not happen to be that kind of place. It happens to be a bitter ideological struggle. This Bill reflects it more than any other Bill produced in this Parliament to date, and I am glad of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) talked about there being no cooperation with the Opposition. I should be very worried if there were co-operation with the Opposition. I want them to oppose, and to oppose intelligently. I want them to oppose as violently as they like. I do not care how many Sittings we have. I should like to sit on Monday mornings at 8 or 9 o'clock. I would certainly have no objection to sitting on a Wednesday morning at the same hour, or on a Friday at 10.30 at night if need be. I am a full-time Member of the House. I like it. I like the battle which goes on here, and I do not think that these debates are a waste of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we shall have our two and a half hours this morning on the Motion and the Amendment. So what? The ball will be at our feet this afternoon, because the time then will be unrestricted, and the time that we spend on the Motion this morning will be made up on the Bill this afternoon, tonight and tomorrow morning.
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
I have no objection to that. But we will get the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to my own position concerning Tuesday afternoons, of course I am put to some inconvenience. I have a good lot of work with the Estimates Committee. I should like to take part in the debate this afternoon on the TSR2. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) talked about Ferranti's but, by heaven, they can protect themselves. We have seen that. It is, however, a legitimate point to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is not so much a question of the protection of Ferranti's as of getting jobs for our people in Scotland and jobs in technological industry? Surely, the hon. Member can show more concern for the ordinary people and their work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never heard so much humbug in such a short interjection. When we think of the Tory record over the years in this matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at my own moderation. The hon. Member will have to get used to this kind of language.

I have no objection to this kind of debate which is taking place this morning. If, however, we are to avoid it as far as we can within a political party assembly, when a major Bill comes to Committee the Government of the day should themselves introduce a timetable on it. They should tell the Opposition that they will allow 10, 20 or 30 sittings on the Bill and that within the confines of such a timetable the Opposition will be allowed to allocate the time. Then, we would get intelligent use of the time which is predetermined by the Government. That would ensure both that the Government get their legislation and that the Opposition can focus their attention on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
points of the Bill which they regard as important. That is not what we are debating today. Short of that, the Government must reserve the right to organise their timetable to ensure that they get their Bill. I have no objection whatever to the Motion moved by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, although, as I have said, it inconveniences me not a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll talked about the Opposition having a stronger case for being in the Chamber than we on the Government side. He inferred that the Government had a vested interest in—I think this was his expression—locking up the wilder supporters of the Government in Committee. There are some pretty wild ones outside Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, if one looks at the attendance in the House of the Opposition up to now in this Parliament, and if one looks at the majorities of the Government, one finds that with a mathematical majority of about three we have seldom had a majority of less than 20 or 30. So there is no evidence that the Opposition are desperately anxious to take part in debates in the House, and I doubt very much whether, if this Committee were not sitting this afternoon, very many of them would be in this afternoon's censure debate. So I do not attach much importance to that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if the Opposition find themselves desperately inconvenienced, then the remedy is in their hands. The more they expedite this Bill, then the more quickly will they get rid of the morning Sittings and the afternoon Sittings and any other kind of Sittings. But the Government of the day must, in the end, decide that they get their legislation. That is what Governments are for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I think we all take it, but is not the problem a little more difficult than that? My hon. Friend has given the Committee the rough figures. It is not, therefore, within our power as an Opposition to limit the time. We have been taking a great deal less time than hon. Gentlemen opposite, and a very great deal less time than hon. Gentlemen opposite plus the Liberal Party. So it does not really lie
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
in our power to speed things up in the way the hon. Gentleman has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman really must distinguish between column inches and the quality of speeches. I am speaking now in the presence of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), who talks more nonsense in this Committee than any other Member I have known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend that this is an objective assessment of the situation. It may well be that hon. Gentlemen opposite think that we waste time, and that the quality of speeches here is inferior to the quality of those from the other side. What I am saying is that if the Opposition set an example by restricting their speeches, then they could get rid of the afternoon Sittings. It is up to them, and I am sure that my hon. Friends, being reasonable fellows, will respond to that example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been said by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) that time has been wasted on the Bill. I must say that I do not agree with him. I have found this nothing but an interesting Bill, and all the points on it have been worth the time which has been spent on them. Surely, if the hon. Gentleman really believes that time has been wasted on this Bill he will also go so far as to say that it is absolute chickenfeed compared with what happened on the Crofters Bill when a Sittings Motion was moved only at the start of the thirteenth Sitting when Clause 7 was being considered, after Clause 1 had gone on for four Sittings and when the hon. Gentleman the Minister had filled ten columns of HANSARD on Clause 1 alone. It is also chickenfeed compared with the Housing (Scotland) Bill which ran for a vast amount of time before the Sittings Motion was put in. On another occasion there—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the seventh Sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 of that was only agreed to at the end of the sixth Sitting. That makes it slightly different. On
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
those occasions, of course, it cannot have been the fault of the Government's supporters, because the hon. Gentleman himself described us rather contemptuously as being like a group of Trappist monks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been very different this time, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will believe me when I say that it is my real anxiety to help him in arriving at what is most convenient to the Committee. This is much more important than the Crofters Bill and much more important than the Housing (Scotland) Bill. Therefore, it seems to me of the very greatest importance that the best possible time should be fixed when Members may contribute to the very best of their ability, and when they can contribute with as little interference as possible with the other duties which they have to perform within this building. The Housing (Scotland) Bill has been called into question in the comments made by hon. Gentlemen opposite. A rather extraordinary remark was made by the hon. Gentleman this morning, when he said that Tuesday afternoon was the most convenient time for hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to ask him why, because there is another precedent as well as the Housing (Scotland) Bill. There was considerable discussion in 1957 on the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Bill, when one had a vast number of opinions on the question of the convenience to hon. Gentlemen, ranging from the elder statesman of the Scottish Grand Committee—namely, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), who said this on 19th March, 1957:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This invasion by the Scottish Standing Committee of the afternoons may be rather serious because, unless the Secretary of State knows the business on a particular afternoon, he may be depriving Scottish Members of their right to take part in the business of the House. I notice, for instance, that no Wednesdays are included in the Motion. There is not the slightest reason why, if the business is to be pressed through very quickly, the right hon. Gentleman should not make use of the Wednesday mornings as well. I can say on behalf of my hon. Friends that they are quite willing to sit on Wednesdays if that is necessary, but we on this side object very strongly to this premature invasion of afternoons, thus taking away from hon. Members the right to take part in the work of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
House itself."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19th March, 1957; c. 7.]</p></blockquote>
Later on he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have no wish to be obstructive, but we do wish that Members of the Committee should have the right to take part in all the business of the Committee without unnecessarily encroaching on their right to take part in the main business in the Chamber."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19th March, 1957; c. 8.]</p></blockquote>
Then later the hon. Gentleman the present Minister of State (Mr. Willis) had this to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…my colleagues and I are to be denied the right to attend the business that we have been sent here to do."</p></blockquote>
That was the business on the Floor of the House.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Could anything be more fantastic and unreasonable? No Member with democratic responsibility to his electors could support that."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19th March, 1957; c. 18.]</p></blockquote>
This volume is really a great fount of information. The hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson)—I am sorry that he is not in his place—expressed very strong views on this matter when he said that to
	<br><blockquote><p>"sacrifice the afternoon, when we have public responsibilities and duties to attend to … is a piece of sheer impertinence."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19th March, 1957; c. 35]</p></blockquote>
I must confess that that pretty well deals with the matter of what hon. Gentlemen thought about the convenience of Tuesday afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also interesting to quote one reflection on this matter from the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). This is a second observation on a different Bill, showing remarkable consistency up to that time. On the Housing (Scotland) Bill he said this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was surprised that the Under-Secretary suggested that we meet on Tuesday afternoon, because this is certainly a bad thing."</p></blockquote>
Three succinct, single syllable words
	<br><blockquote><p>"What will happen to the work of the House of Commons? Hon. Members should be given the opportunity of attending the House and dealing with business on the Floor of the House."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 329.]</p></blockquote>
That is why I come back to the point, that we ought to select a time at which there will be the least possible interference with the duties of hon. Members on both sides of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
Although I appreciate the importance of the business which is on the Floor of the House on Wednesday mornings, I would have ventured to say that I believe, so far as the general interests of all our constituents are concerned, that it is more important that we should be in the House at a time when the Finance Bill must be certain to be taking its place on some Tuesday afternoons. It would be most surprising if it were not doing so in the not too far distant future. There is the question of the future of the TSR2 this very afternoon and, having a Ferranti works within my constituency, where there is considerable concern about what the future holds for the employees in that works, I would certainly think it more important for me to be attending the debate this afternoon than attending the debate tomorrow morning, although I have quite emphatic views on the subject which is to be discussed on Wednesday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which has been touched upon is the question of consultations which have taken place between the two sides on this matter of Tuesday afternoon Sittings. If one looks back to that Sittings Motion debate on 20th February, 1962, one finds the hon. Gentleman the Member for Motherwell expressing great objection to the fact that no consultations had taken place with the Opposition, but if one reads on, in the continuation of the debate on 22nd February, 1962, one finds the right hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison), who was in charge of the Opposition on the Bill saying this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister will realise that there was a very friendly discussion and there was nothing about a brush off or anything else like that. It is important that that should be understood."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 22nd February, 1962; c. 365.]</p></blockquote>
It is quite clear that on that occasion there were certain discussions. The matter was put and was talked over, and from what the right hon. Lady said it was perfectly clear that the Opposition of the day, having been asked their view, decided that they did not like the idea and they rejected it. Quite obviously, this was perfectly proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it seems to me, from what we have heard so far, that there have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
no consultations within the meaning of the word at all. That leads me to another quotation from the right hon. Gentleman who is now Secretary of State for Scotland. During the discussion on the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Bill on 19th March he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should not be arrogantly assumed by right hon. and hon. Members opposite that they are thinking of our convenience without even consulting us as to whether the proposal is, in fact, convenient to us."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19th March, 1957; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
So far as I can make out, here there has been virtually no consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate from which I have quoted the Minister of State waxed very indignant. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is one of the Parliamentary courtesies that discussions are conducted through the usual channels to see what might suit us. It is not good enough to say to the Opposition, even through the usual channels, 'We are going to meet three times a week'. That is not negotiation. It is very much like intimidation of the Opposition …".—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19th March, 1957; c. 16.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know, but no doubt the Liberal Party will be making its views known in this debate and we shall be told whether they were—or he was—consulted. I should certainly think the hon. Gentleman has every reason to take umbrage if he was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the debate on the Sittings Motion on the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Bill, the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), referred, rather contemptuously, to what he called, "anaemic Lobby fodder" who would vote as they were directed. I prefer the more elegant expression of one Private Willis of the play by Gilbert and Sullivan. Perhaps I may just remind the Committee because I think it typical. After saying
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am an intellectual chap,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And think of things that would astonish you"</p></blockquote>
he went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When in that House M.Ps divide,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If they've a brain and cerebellum too.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>They've got to leave that brain outside,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to."</p></blockquote>
I hope profoundly that the hon. Member for Fife, West and the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm Mac-Millan) will resent the implication made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
by that celebrated Private Willis and will take a line which will enable them to do what is in the best interests of their constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may now intervene. I have not spoken at length up to now. I agree with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), about the importance of this Bill. I said during my opening remarks that I do not complain about the time taken by anyone. Perhaps I may take the opportunity to congratulate not only the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West but other hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite on the marked improvement in their reading and studies. I listened to the hon. Member quoting from my own speeches and I am bound to say I had not thought before they were as good as that. A study of them will improve the performances of members of the present Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main burden of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West was that difficulties were created for hon. Members. It does not matter when we may meet: difficulties for hon. Members will be created. That applies to all the arguments advanced by hon. Members opposite about the choice of Tuesdays. If we met on Wednesday mornings difficulties would be created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None has been mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would created great difficulty for me. I am supposed to be on the Government Front Bench in the Chamber—[HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."]—Hon. Members are talking about their own difficulties. I assume that hon. Members opposite are interested in the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill. They were sufficiently interested to drag the Committee discussions back on to the Floor of the House. It is no use telling us now that it is not an important Bill. Hon. Members opposite would not have taken that step unless they thought it a supremely important Bill. Up to the present they have not attempted to bring the Committee discussions on this Bill to the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister of State tell the Committee whether he regards the debate on the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill as being
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
more important than the Budget debate or the debate we are to have this afternoon on the question of the TSR2? That is the sort of business which he is proposing hon. Members on this Committee should be excluded from participating in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am pointing out is that hon. Members opposite thought that the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill was so important that they dragged the Committee discussions back to the Floor of the House. All right, they can do so, but they cannot now say that it is not important. That was one of the arguments advanced this morning, that this Bill was more important than the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot give way, I must get on. I did not interrupt many hon. Members opposite. Hon. Members opposite have accepted the arguments which they have been advancing and now they must accept the replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not been advancing this argument at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to another point. The Minister has said that he has to be on the Government Front Bench in the Chamber on Wednesday mornings. There are a large number of Ministers at the Scottish Office. Surely another Minister would be able to do that. It is not necessary that the hon. Gentleman should be there. May I add that I have not heard hon. Members on this side of the Committee arguing that the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill was more important than this Bill? I think the Minister is wrong about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that hon. Members argued in that way. All I am pointing out is that hon. Members opposite brought the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill back to the Floor of the House. Obviously, they thought the Bill was important, and I am not quarrelling with that, but they cannot say at the same time it is not very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course another Scottish Minister could be present on the Government Front Bench in the Chamber, but that would cause inconvenience. I am not complaining about that or saying we should not make arrangements. All I am saying is it causes inconvenience. Hon. Members opposite have been talking about inconvenience and my sole reply is that whatever we propose there will be the greatest difficulties for some hon. Members. This is one of the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman argued that debates in the House on Tuesday afternoons are important. Of course debates in the House of Commons are important. One frequently has a situation in which hon. Members opposite may find themselves in the Estimates Committee and they have to make up their minds whether they think the business of that Committee is more important than the Ferranti debate, or whether it is more important than the Budget debate. They may be Members of the Public Accounts Committee, which meets when the House is sitting, or they may be serving on other Committees which meet at that time. There is nothing new in the procedure: it has always been the case. Hon. Members have to make up their minds about what business they think is most important. Hon. Members do that in relation to their constituencies. They may have a constituency engagement and they have to ask themselves which is the most important, to keep the engagement or to be present in the House. Hardly a day goes by when hon. Members do not have to ask themselves what, at a given time, is the most important duty for them to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same thing applies in relation to Sittings of a Committee in the afternoon. For 13 years, when hon. Members opposite were in office, there were afternoon Sittings of Committees. I have been present during debates on housing legislation and on Committees which debated an enormous number of Bills during the afternoon and continued to 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock even to 9 o'clock in the morning. Some of the discussions continued without any pause to see what progress could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the very first morning on which the Committee which dealt with the pipelines legislation sat I was confronted with a Sittings Motion. A Bill was introduced
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
into the Scottish Committee and on the very first morning a Sittings Motion was introduced—I think it was a Bill relating to divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that the Sittings Motion was introduced and a careful explanation given that it was introduced in order to protect hon. Members in relation to the other Sittings of our Committee—on Matters and Estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am putting to hon. Members is what happened. No one has mentioned these things. We have not introduced a Sittings Motion at the first meeting of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) was rather concerned about changing the procedure in the House or the Committee. He should put his suggestions to the Committee on Procedure and no doubt they will be considered. The hon. Gentleman had a novel philosophy that if I accepted Amendments moved by the Opposition the business of the Committee could speedily be finished. It is quite a novel doctrine that if I put Tory policy into operation everything will go swimmingly. That is a typical example of Tory arrogance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A good one, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is a good one. We are very conscious of this arrogance. We have been experiencing it for so many years and we recognise it. We only wish that the electors would recognise more clearly this arrogant state of mind—"Do as we want you to do, and then we will allow you to get your business quite easily." No Government could accept that for a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) if I did not explain the reasons for the Motion in greater detail. They are simple. The Government have a programme which they must get through during the Parliamentary Session. They also have to try to preserve the rights of individual Members and of the Opposition, as was mentioned just now by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). In other words, we have to preserve eight mornings during the Session. Six of them are for the Estimates, and two for Matters
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
Motions, although the Motions are not always Opposition Motions. In addition, we have a programme of legislation to complete, and therefore we make a calculation, as any Government would have to do, about when we want certain Bills finished. Clearly, we could not finish a Bill in the estimated time without extra Sittings, if there should be more discussion on it than we had anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not complain about the discussion. I recognise that hon. Members serving on this Committee have good reason to want to speak. And if they wish to speak I have to find time from somewhere, if we are to preserve our programme. That is why I moved the Motion this morning. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) made the point that we could not blame the Opposition because they had not done the majority of the speaking. It does not make any difference to me who speaks, whether it be the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) or Members of the official Opposition or of the unofficial Opposition. The fact remains that time is being taken. It is possible that the official Opposition has not taken all that amount of time, but it does not alter my position in having to find time in which to get this Bill through Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has to look at the practicality of suggestions which have been made about Mondays and Fridays and various other times, but I am a very kindly politician and I do not like disturbing the habits of my fellow Members, and therefore I bear in mind also the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we should meet at 10.30 at night. That might be a useful thing to bear in mind in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of consultation, which is probably the only major point with which I have not dealt, I understood that my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) had informed hon. Gentlemen opposite. I know that he said that he was going to inform the Opposition about it, but what kind of talks there were I do not know—[HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"]—Because I was not at the talks. I only know that he said that he would inform hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do think it is a little odd that the Minister should say that he does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not at the talks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely we can take it that the Minister of State and the Government Whip talk to each other and tell each other what they are doing? I recall that the other day the Minister of State did not seem to know what his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was saying and doing. Does he intend to create the impression, which is perhaps given erroneously, that he does not discuss these things with his colleagues in the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I knew about this, but the right hon. Gentleman asked me what was in my right hon. Friend's mind. I merely pointed out that, in spite of being a man of many parts, I was not quite able to look into somebody else's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and I talk about these things, but I was not at the conversations. I understand that he told hon. Members opposite about this, but naturally I cannot be certain exactly what happened since I was not there. I knew that this had been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customarily, we gave notice last Thursday that we would be moving this Motion today. I remind hon. Gentlemen opposite that had I wished to be discourteous to them I could have moved the Motion last Thursday without having given any notice about it. Instead of giving notice I could have moved the Motion then. It was because I did not want to be discourteous to hon. Gentlemen opposite—because I wished them to see what we were doing—that notice of our proposal was given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at the moment still operating under the existing Sittings Motion, which means that we meet on Thursday next if we do not carry the Motion. However, I do not propose we sit next Thursday. Also, when we come back after the Easter Recess we will not meet on the Tuesday morning. Under the former Sittings Motion we would have been sitting on that Tuesday morning and I could have framed this Motion so that we would sit on the Tuesday morning after we come back, since we shall be coming back on the Monday. However, I do not wish the Committee to meet either on the Tuesday morning after our return or next Thursday because I consider

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must get his facts straight about the procedure in Committee before he talks too much on the subject. The fact is that under our present Sittings Motion we would meet on Thursday. As I said, I do not propose to meet on Thursday under this Motion or on the Tuesday after we return because I know that certain hon. Members have made arrangements and had assumed that the House would not meet till Tuesday afternoon. As it happens, we are now returning on the Monday instead of the Tuesday. I thought that it would be unfair, in view of the short notice that had been given of our returning on Monday, to meet on the Tuesday morning and, therefore, we will meet on the Tuesday afternoon, and, of course, on the Thursday forenoon.

I have tried to explain what the Motion is designed to do and I think that I have answered most of the points which have been raised. I apologise if I have missed some. I think that I have covered the main arguments, and I hope that the Committee will now come to a decision on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends and I are able to support. He dealt most inadequately with the question of the Tuesday morning immediately after the Recess. If the Motion is carried it will involve our meeting not on the Tuesday morning but on the Tuesday afternoon, for some unspecified time, and it will involve not meeting at all this coming Thursday morning.

If the Minister is so keen to make progress, as my hon. Friends and I are, I suggest that it would be more reasonable to keep to the terms of the existing sittings Motion and have our sitting next Thursday morning and a further sitting on the Tuesday morning after we reassemble. I am sure that my hon. Friends shared my feeling that, because we were given notice that the House was to reassemble one day earlier, we would be meeting in this Committee on the Tuesday morning. I fail to understand why the Minister should want to give himself and his hon. Friends a holiday on that Tuesday morning when we have this most important Bill before us and when we want to make progress on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that some of my hon. Friends are quite prepared to meet on the Tuesday morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the support of the hon. Gentleman on this point. I am sure, therefore, that he would support our approach to the problem rather than the curious diversion introduced by his hon. Friend the Minister of State, a diversion which has taken up so much time which could have been profitably devoted to making progress on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to precedents. I think that it is highly unusual for a Sittings Motion to be introduced so soon in the progress of a major Bill, when quite good progress has been made. We are, after all, now well into Clause 3. I remember the debate which took place on the Housing (Scotland) Bill in this Committee, a debate to which some of my hon. Friends have already referred. On that occasion a Sittings Motion was proposed at the seventh Sitting, as we are today on this Bill, but the difference on that occasion was that the Opposition had taken so long on Clause 1 that we had made no further progress than that. It was a quite different situation from the one with which we are confronted today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Divorce Bill and he is right to say that a Sittings Motion was moved at the first Sitting. The reason for that was because we were anxious at that time to assist one of my hon. Friends to make progress with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
what was an important Measure of social reform, but not at the expense of interferring with the rights of this Committee from the point of view of Matter days and Estimates days. The Minister expressed great concern about obtaining Matter days and Estimate days later this Session. Would it not have been proper for that concern to have been expressed a little earlier and in another and more obvious way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was also made to the Housing (Scotland) Bill, 1962, during the Committee on which the right hon. Lady who is now the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance gave an expression of opinion which I do not think can be improved upon today, when she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that any unbiased person examining the Reports of those six days which we have spent of Clause 1 would agree that there has been no sign of filibustering at all. Clause 1 is an important Clause, and we in the Opposition have done our best to examine it carefully and to try to improve it. It seems to us that we shall also have to examine the rest of the Bill very carefully indeed."</p></blockquote>
She went on to say that while hon. Members on her side of the Committee were no more enthusiastic than others about sitting a third time in a week, she assured the Minister that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we on this side are no more enthusiastic than he or his hon. Friends, but we on this side do realise that we have certain duties to perform as Members of Parliament. Those duties include examining carefully a Bill in Committee, and they also entail duties on the Floor of the House. It is because we consider our duties on the Floor of the House of such importance that we are proposing that, instead of meeting on Tuesday afternoons, we ought to meet on Wednesday mornings."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Lady made the point then that she was going some way to meet the Government on the matter. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" In other words, in my Amendment we are going some way to meet the Under-Secretary of State on this matter. I could just have asked my hon. Friends to oppose completely any further Sittings of the Committee apart from the two a week which we are already having on this Bill. I gave serious thought to what type of Amendment I ought to move, and I came to the conclusion, having taken many things into account, that I would be willing to give up Wednesday mornings to discuss this Bill. We want to improve the Bill if we possibly can, and it seems to me that if we were willing to give up Wednesday mornings it might prevent the Minister from having what might be the ultimate sanction to get this Bill through quickly."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 288-9.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Original Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Steele, I am grateful to you for giving the Committee this opportunity, which I do not think need be very long, to discuss the main Question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised, I am bound to admit, at the action which the Minister of State took, because I can remember, in the debate to which I have referred already, on the Housing Bill in 1962, the Minister of State saying to the Committee that the Under-Secretary—that was the late Gil Leburn—should not dash in with closures but should rather take the opportunity of providing more time, so long as the extra time did not interfere with the work of the House. He went on and told the Committee what he imagined the late Mr. Leburn would say to the Committee, and said he would be saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is very decent of the Opposition. Acting in their usual magnanimous manner</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 16, Noes 15.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 16, Noes 15.</p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>they have kindly offered to give us this time. I will now not press for Tuesday afternoon."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20th February, 1962; c. 332.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>This is an exactly similar occasion and that was how the hon. Gentleman spoke at that time.</p>
	<p>I did, in my opening to the debate, say that I thought that the second part of the debate might well centre round whether it was right that we should sit three times a week at this stage of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman the Minister of State did say to the Committee—and I do not think he meant to mislead it—that it was not unusual to ask Committees to sit at the same time that the House was sitting. He instanced the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee, but there is a very significant difference, I believe, between those Committees and this Committee, because today we have 35 Scottish Members discussing an important Scottish Bill. In the case of the Public Accounts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
and the Estimates Committees and so on there may often have been and often are one or two Scotsmen, but we are removing from the Floor of the House many more here. For any Members doing as the hon. Gentleman the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) rightly said they should do in Committee—taking an interest, and following the arguments, trying to persuade the Minister or to persuade hon. Gentlemen on the opposite side, that there are arguments, good or bad—it is impossible to be tearing backwards and forwards to and from the House.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), I think, made a perfectly valid point—he knows how valid it is, and how it could be twisted—that if there are debates in the House one does not always see 30 or 40 Scottish Members sitting there listening to every ford; but he knows, too, that there are other things to be done, and it is impossible for us—and the Minister knows it is—in this Committee to forecast what is coming on in the House on different Tuesdays. It is difficult for us to tell whether our constituencies are best served by our being in this Committee or by our being in the House.</p>
	<p>I think it is wrong, when the Opposition have offered all these alternative times—some of them, no doubt, better than others—for the Minister just to dismiss them and say it is inconvenient to him because he wants to be somewhere else.</p>
	<p>But coming back to the main point that I think is of real importance to this Committee, it is whether or not we make the sort of progress desired by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who, I thought, made a tremendously good speech, which was very understandable to all Members of the Committee who have been here for any length of time. In our first six or nine months we all inevitably think that the House of Commons is a very odd place—I will not put it higher or lower than that—we have not yet got used to the ideological clash which the Member for Fife, West enjoys and is prepared to spend day and night working to achieve; it does seem a little odd to many hon. Members, and I think the hon. Member opposite had the same sort of feeling.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
	<p>Examining the precedents for moving Sittings Motions of this sort I think one thing stands out very clearly. The Government, of course, want to get their business. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right in saying that, but I am certain that he is also aware—and, if he is not, the shortest consultation with his officials will confirm it for him—that there has not been, I suppose, any Scottish Bill practically in the last fifteen years which has gone through the Scottish Committee in the time in which the officials told the Minister they thought it would go through. Therefore, I do not think he need be apologetic: I do not think his officials will say that this is a particularly fatuous Minister of State because he is not going forward so fast. They may do so, of course, but it would probably be for a different reason.</p>
	<p>The point which I think comes out from all the discussions on this type of thing is that the time when the Government rightly say "We must get our business" comes in the late months of the year, in May or June, when, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Government are trying to do two difficult things at once, trying to obtain their own business, which it is their right and duty to do, and trying at the same time to see that Members of the Committee get a proper chance to discuss Matters and Estimates and so on. I know the clash of opinion and the clash of interest between these two different things, and which occur in discussions through the usual channels over and over again as the summer progresses.</p>
	<p>But here we are early in the year. I am not blaming the hon. Gentleman for bringing the Bill in earlier in the Session, to give us more time at it. I know it would be unfair to do so even though, now that he has brought it in, he still, as his hon. Friend said, cannot give the Committee any real indication of the ideas which he has in mind. However, I think it is almost always true that it helps the Government to get their business if these Sittings Motions are moved when the Committee itself feels that there is real justification for them.</p>
	<p>Now, I dare to say to this Committee that outside the Minister of State himself, and perhaps the Opposition Whip, with whom he tells us he has discussed it, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
do not believe there is one single Member of this Committee, and certainly not one who has been on Scottish Committees in previous Parliaments, who can honestly believe that we have been wasting time. Therefore I do say to the Minister that to try and force this Committee to do a thing which historically, for many years—</p>

	<p>the business is over, unless there is something immediately consequential.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that the hon. Member's hopes are disappointed. The fact is that once I have started on the procedure of taking the vote, then I can continue till that has been decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. At the beginning of this debate you ruled, Mr. Steele, that different proposals for the time of the Committee's meetings should be discussed in conjunction, and that the debate should be general in its range. In point of fact, there are many on this side of the Committee who have particular views about the times the Committee should meet. Those times have not been discussed this morning. We have not had the opportunity of putting forward points of view, and this affects us as individuals in doing our job in representing our constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have just ruled, Mr. Steele, that it is not in order to continue the proceedings once one o'clock has struck, but we are now proceeding to take a further vote and I suggest that this is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been instructed to put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
