I beg to move, in page 1, line 9, after "proceedings" to insert "at meetings". The Amendments are a watering down of the terms of the Bill as originally drafted and are a compromise reached with Members of the Opposition. In that sense—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I should like just to say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Members kindly withdraw from the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Members will not withdraw from the Committee I have no alternative but to suspend the Sitting of the Committee, which I accordingly do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. William Hamilton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the Amendment represented a dilution of the terms of the Bill as drafted, being the result of informal discussions, through what I may call the unusual channels, between myself and certain hon. Members on the Opposition side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recognise that I am not by nature or temperament a compromiser, but, as one gets older, I suppose one mellows a little. This must be the explanation, which I hope hon. Members will accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendments is to prohibit ex officio members of local authorities from voting at council meetings, at which they may speak. They will be able to sit on any of the subcommittees or committees, and to take part in the proceedings. That is a satisfactory compromise in all the circumstances, and I hope that the Amendments will be agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not often, as the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) has just said, that he and I find ourselves in agreement with each other. On this occasion the reason perhaps is that our discussions have not been across the Floor of the House or of the Committee but have been, as it were, behind the scenes, when I always find the hon. Member very much more reasonable, if I may say so, than on other occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for me to tell the Committee that when the Bill was first introduced I did not like it at all. The last time a similar Bill was introduced
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
by the hon. Gentleman who is now the Minister of State, who, I am glad to see, is with us, I spoke against it and I am glad to say that on a vote it was defeated. However, we must recognise that the political scene has changed since then. There is now a Socialist Government. I do not think they are likely to last very long, but there they are, and they are opposed to the existence of these ex officio officers. That is a fact which we have to take into account. But if the political scene has changed the Bill, as it now will emerge with the Amendments being proposed this morning, is a very different Bill from that of the Minister of State, and which the House, in the last Parliament, rejected so decisively. He may be Minister of State but he has shown that he is a less skilful politician than his hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West. It may be that in any future reconstruction of the Government—if there is time for any—this point will be noted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee if I am taking rather longer than did the hon. Member for Fife, West, but it is necessary for me to explain to some of our supporters outside the Committee exactly how we are where we are this morning. The Bill began, as the old one did, as a Measure proposing to abolish out and out the right of ex officio officers to sit in town councils, although they have sat there for hundreds of years, doing very valuable work. After the Bill was published the hon. Member for Fife, West, and I had some discussions, and he amended it to allow the officers to sit in the Committees and in the council. Originally they were going to be abolished altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought this was an improvement, but I still felt that the Bill was unduly severe and unnecessarily restrictive for the hon. Member's purposes, which I entirely understood, even though I did not necessarily agree with them, so he and I had some further discussions and, as he has indicated, we agreed that if he would introduce the present Amendment to allow voting in the committees we on this side would no longer block the Bill, as we had the right to do, and as we had the power to do because of the position of the Bill in the Ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the further Amendment will be that the ex officio officers will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
able to take part in the day to day affairs of the corporations, and to speak on any issue and vote in the committees, but they will not be able to vote in the council as a whole. That is the price that has had to be paid for the continued membership of these ex officio officers in the various corporations to which they are attached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking into account the political situation—a Socialist Government opposed to these ex officio officers altogether, and a Conservative Opposition able to prevent any action at the present time—I think this is a very fair compromise from the point of view of both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government side would like to abolish these officers, root and branch, as they have said many times, but, to prevent them now, at this moment, from having the power to influence decisions in closely-balanced corporations—and I understand there is only one of them in Scotland—the Government side are willing to accept some other features which they do not really like, such as the continued existence of the officers in the councils although with diminished powers. In the same way we on this side would have preferred the status quo because these officers, in our view, have been doing very valuable work for a great number of years, and in an era when so many business men live outside city boundaries contribute greatly to the prosperity of various cities as deans of guild or deacon conveners or conveners of trades, and represent the business element. And represent them democratically, I should point out, because in Glasgow the number of voters who vote for them is more than 10,000. The ex officio officers bring a form of experience and advice which is valuable to a thriving community, and which should be preserved, if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Feeling like this, we could have blocked the Bill outright, and prevented any change from taking place, at least in the immediate future. This course of action was canvassed, I must admit, by several, although not by a majority of my own hon. Friends. I personally, though I felt with my heart like them, with my head did not feel that that was wise, and so I got in touch with all the bodies represented. When hon. Members see the size of the pile of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
communications which I have had I think they may feel that perhaps the Bill, instead of being called "Hamilton's Bill", might well be called "Galbraith's Bill", because I am sure that I have done more work on it than the hon. Gentleman has. But merit is not always rewarded as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any rate, I got in touch with all these bodies and they all agreed rapidly, as one of them put it, that half a loaf is better than no bread at all and that the compromise should be accepted, although, naturally, it was not something they wanted to do. They thought it would be better to accept the compromise than run the risk that on some future occasion the hon. Member for Fife, West might be more fortunate and higher up the Ballot, and, having been thwarted this time, would be influenced to retaliate by sweeping these ex officio officers away altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bodies affected were encouraged to take this view because the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Scotland told me in a letter that if the hon. Gentleman's Bill got through and on to the Statute Book it was not his intention to pursue the matter any further; in fact, these ex officio officers would be taken out of the arena of political controversy altogether in the future—though that is something they never would be—and would be able to continue to perform the bulk of the work which they have been doing so well for so long. Looking at the matter from the point of view of both sides of this Committee I think this is a reasonable compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Final authority rests with the democratically elected representatives. This is something for which the Labour Party has fought for a great number of years. If the Bill goes through, as amended, they will have achieved that, and that is the real object of the operation from their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of the ex officio officers, who only reach their offices after long years of voluntary service of great benefit to the community, they will still be able to give almost as much if not as much service in the future as they have done in the past. The value of their traditions and public-spirited service will not be lost to the community, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
they will continue to form an integral part of the councils and of their work. They have had to sacrifice something. What they sacrifice is their vote in the full corporation. They have shown that they are willing to make this sacrifice in order to be able to continue and to preserve the right to serve the community as they have done for so many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we on both sides of this Committee, without too much argument, should set our seal upon the compromise which will give nobody exactly what he wants but gives everybody something which he believes to be of great value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government agree with the terms of the Amendment. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has no intention of touching this matter again during the course of his next local government Bill, which I assume means during his term of office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We really ought to be clear about this. The right hon. Gentleman said in his letter that he cannot bind his successors for all time. That is reasonable. Everybody knows that. But this ought to be a gentleman's agreement, and we should feel very severely let down if, in the next Session or the next after that, if he were in office—he were to introduce a local government Bill to remove the ex officio officers from the council, when the sting has been taken out of the matter through this Bill. We should like an assurance from the Minister of State that so long as he and his right hon. Friend are at the Scottish Office they have no intention of doing that, because we would feel that that would not be honourable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is getting so heated. He has my right hon. Friend's letter in front of him and he knows what it says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to get one thing clear. I did not have any doubt until the hon. Gentleman started speaking. I am sure that everything is all right, but I would like to be certain. This is where we are helping the Government and it ought to be recognised we are facilitating the Government's side in doing something which they could not do if we were to dig our toes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
What the Secretary of State says is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not my intention, if Mr. Hamilton's Bill goes through and reaches the Statute Book, of tackling the subject of the dean of guilds, etc., in my next Local Government Bill."</p></blockquote>
I took this to mean that not only did the Minister mean his next local government Bill but any local government Bill, that he or the present team of the Scottish Office would produce. He says he cannot bind his successor for all time and that is perfectly true. I would like to feel that he and his team, so long as they are in office, are bound not to change this compromise which, after a great deal of hard work, the two sides have managed to fix up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is once again getting greatly excited about something. I said that what my right hon. Friend had said is as contained in the letter. I went on to say that naturally I assumed this meant during the term of office of my right hon. Friend. There is really no quarrel between us. The hon. Gentleman with his usual impetuosity, bounded up, very much like his father used to bound up, and started this argument. I rose only to state, for the purposes of the record, that the Government did accept these Amendments, and to point out that exchanges had taken place between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the hon. Gentleman which confirmed this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of those representing the City of Edinburgh, whose special interest has, perhaps, been naturally greater than that of certain of the other three cities, it is not improper or unreasonable that I should say that although this Bill does not go as far as I would have liked, it represents a considerable triumph for what I believe to be common sense. I am thinking not only in terms of political expediency, but the whole approach to this matter on each side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think anyone would deny the importance of the work done by the dean of guilds and his court. This is not under dispute. He and his court decide on matters concerning such things as the erecting of all buildings, ensuring they are built to the proper specification, and protecting the rights of those who are to live there, the formation of streets and new highways, and so on. It is, therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
of great importance for the efficient carrying out of this job that there should be, as dean, somebody who has technical knowledge of what must be a highly technical subject. One cannot guarantee that one will get such a man from among the elected members of the town councils and local authorities of any of the cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could find an expert in the matter from among the officials of the town councils but I think an extremely important feature of the dean of guild Court is the complete independence of the local authority and in such a case that would be lost. Having taken part in certain matters when the Corporation and the City of Edinburgh have been in dispute with the dean of guild Court, I think that were the dean of guild Court to lose that independence by having an official of the Corporation presiding over it it would be a retrograde step. We are, therefore, continuing to make it possible to introduce into the civil affairs of these four cities someone who is an expert and who will be an independent dean of guild.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only matter which has been in dispute is how great a part he should play in civic affairs. One might ask, should he be allowed to play as much part as the aldermen do in England? Aldermen are not elected by the ratepayers, but by the councils, and the only limitation I have been able to find on aldermen in England is that they cannot take part in the election of other aldermen. Otherwise they vote as freely as any democratically elected councillor. That would not be an altogether unreasonable analogy here. That is why, particularly where one has what might be broadly described as a needle situation, in which the votes are very close, I do not believe that the votes of non-elected persons ought to be decisive in matters outside their own sphere of interest. It is surely right that the deans of guild should vote in the committees on which they sit where their experience counts, such as the planning and highways committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point at which I fall out on this Bill is that I think there is a very good case for these non-representatives being permitted, not only to report the conclusions and the views of their specialist committees to the council, but having reported that the committee feels
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
strongly about a certain point they should be allowed to cast their votes in the council on the matters within their sphere of influence but not on other matters. Had that been the final situation I would have regarded this as having met all the views I hold of this matter. As my hon. Friend has said, when one gets sharply defined views held on each side of the committee it would be too much to expect one should get all one's views conceded 100 per cent. The view I hold, thanks to the exchange of opinions which have taken place in considerable amity, is that we have reached a conclusion which is fair, democratic, and will meet the wishes of the great majority of those who are affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite my former inclinations I shall not now attempt to upset the even tenor and climate in the Committee. I think it is right, as one of the representatives of the City of Glasgow where a situation there led to efforts being made to deal with this matter, that I should address the Committee. I think the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), has made a very fair speech. There are those of us who would have gone the whole way in the right of unelected members to participate in the proceedings of a local council. I think that my hon. Friend, with this Bill, has gained a shadow and lost a substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the previous occasion there was a sufficient majority to defeat the efforts then made. In the present circumstances that sizeable majority does not exist, and I think my hon. Friend has had no alternative but to accept the Amendment proposed. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West has been fair enough to state that there are these special qualifications and this special knowledge which the dean of guild and the deacon Convener may bring to these considerations. On the whole I hope that the Committee can proceed with this, and I am glad my hon. Friend has had disarmament conferences behind the scenes and that the Clause can now be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of the members representing the City of Aberdeen, to which this Bill will apply, I would like to say that I, too, think this a reasonable and common-sense compromise. I think all hon. Members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Committee must be intrigued and fascinated by what was described as the mellowing of the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). He is a skilful politician. I would say that, as far as the City of Aberdeen is concerned, I am not aware of any reflection ever being made on the independent attitude or the restraint with which these ex officio members have carried out their duties until now. All citizens in Aberdeen recognise the standing and the very long service given to the community by these ex officio members. We do not have the needle-like position which appertains in another city. We have a large Labour majority and therefore the extra vote does not alter the situation, although, naturally, we hope that it will not be long before that position is reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long, historic tradition of these offices and the service which they represent has been recognised by the sponsors of the Bill. This is a reasonable compromise, and I, too, welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment made:</i> In page 1, line 10, leave out "or of committees or sub-committees thereof".—	<i>[Mr. William Hamilton.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the passage of the Bill, but it would be wrong to allow this Clause to pass without certain comments being made on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), who believes himself to be mellowing, expresses a view of his state of health which surprises me. However, over these last weeks, his attitude towards these ancient offices seems to have mellowed somewhat, and I express my appreciation of that. At the same time, I do not think that he can get away completely with this picture of himself as a mellow, pleasant and warmhearted character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this morning I looked back at the speech which the hon. Member made when he sought leave to introduce the Bill—and, goodness me, what a speech it was! There was no mellowness there. He was—and I think that he recognises this—almost offensive, if unintentionally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
so, to the gentlemen who occupy these offices in Scotland, and his description of the early origin of these offices was quite extraordinary. Words like "corruption", "irresponsibility", "inequity", "impenetrability", and phrases like "unsavoury characters" and their "degenerate rule" spatter his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those were quotes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He said that these gentlemen were the early Tory Party. Certainly they exercised great authority in Perth, and they also had great responsibilities to carry. While they had rights and privileges, they also had to keep watch and ward, and hold stob and staik, and pay scot and lot, and many other responsibilities of that kind which, I should have thought, would appeal to the hon. Gentleman's sense of duty. They also operated a system of quality control and price control, which I should have thought the hon. Gentleman would welcome. There was a system of meal searchers and ale tasters and meat appraisers—words which I should have thought would make the hon. Gentleman happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position changed over the years, and after a rather questionable period, perhaps, the present system was established by, I believe, the Burgh Reform Act, 1833. The hon. Gentleman produced some questioning of the effect of that Act two years later by the Royal Commission of 1835, but the deans of guild have performed a very valuable function in towns such as mine. It is often said that they are unelected members. They are unelected in the sense that they do not stand for election in the way that councillors normally do, but they are elected by the Guildry Incorporation in Perth which consists of about 300 members representing the trade interests of the town. The dean of guild sits on the Council by reason of his election as the representative of those interests. This is a very ancient office. One may say that it is undemocratic. Perhaps it is. But is it any more undemocratic than the aldermanic system in England to which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) referred? I cannot believe that it is. Is it any less democratic than some of the manoeuvring
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
which takes place within Labour Party associations and constituencies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or within the Tory Party about its leadership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman's approach to the whole question is governed not so much by a desire to stamp out undemocratic practices as by his appreciation of antiquity, which is always at a low level. The fact that these offices have lasted for a long time is not sufficient reason for abolishing them. The fact that they have lasted a long time suggests to me that we should be very careful before tampering with them or changing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, however, that the Clause as amended is less undesirable than it was. I still think that the Bill is unnecessary. I certainly would have opposed it had this change not been made because it is not reasonable to expect hardworking and responsible citizens to occupy these offices if we strip them of all their voting power and executive authority which traditionally go with the office. The hon. Member for Fife, West has clipped the wings of these gentlemen in the full council. However, he has allowed their vote to be retained in the committees to which they belong, and that at least is a less retrograde step than his original proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede that the deans of guild and the deacon conveners have performed a valuable and selfless function. One may question the conduct of affairs in medieval times, as one may question a great many other aspects of our national life in the past. It would be a mistake if these devoted people thought that the view expressed by the hon. Gentleman when he sought leave to introduce the Bill represented the view of the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not speak long, nor have I any wish to hold up the Bill or the ones following, but I wish to put the position of Edinburgh, and that, briefly, that it does not want any change at all. I should like to ask the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), who, besides himself, supports the Bill? Because there are no other names on it. Also, could he tell me what representations he has had from people in Edinburgh or organisations in that city recommending the change? These are important points. I am a Member for Edinburgh, and I have received no such representations. Indeed, I have been asked to oppose the Bill. Other Members who represent Edinburgh must also have been approached along the same lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear quite a lot in this Committee the cry, "Trust the local authorities and try to do what they want". In this case, I am endeavouring to do so. The dean of guild and the deacon convenor in Edinburgh have been connected with the city for many centuries—back to 1403, if not earlier. The dean is elected by those in the building trade. He is a practical man and experienced, and he presides over the court which controls architectural, engineering and building operations. If there were no dean of guild, somebody would still have to preside over the Court—it might be a town councillor—but there would be no guarantee that such a person would necessarily be well qualified or as well qualified as or have the experience of deans of recent years and the present dean. Very similar arguments apply to the convenor of trades, who does much charitable work and runs the incorporated trades of Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This system has operated very well over the centuries, and it is significant that in the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947, the position of these officials was expressly preserved. Indeed, the wording of my new Clause is taken from
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Section 330 of that Act. Hon. Members will recall that that Act was passed by the then Labour Government. What has changed the position? That is what I want to know. Why were hon. Members opposite happy then but are not happy now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a feeling in the mind of the hon. Member for Fife, West that these officials are connected with the Progressive Party; but they do not attend Progressive Party meetings, nor do they vote on political matters, and the records will substantiate that. Indeed, they have on occasion voted with the Labour members. I regard their position as very much the same as that of aldermen in England. I know of no move or intention to abolish aldermen, and I do not see why these officials should have these powers cancelled in Edinburgh. It seems to us in Edinburgh illogical that a man can vote and speak in committee and can speak in the whole council, but cannot vote. I should have thought that it was necessary that he should vote, particularly where technical matters are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the nation as a whole there are many ways of conducting our affairs. There are Church representatives on the education committees; there are block votes in the trade unions; Members of the House of Lords are appointed; co-option to committees is common form practice in many walks of life and in many organisations. Doubtless all these systems could be attacked in detail or in theory, but they are generally accepted and we approve them and use them. So it is with the dean of guild and the convener of trades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Edinburgh simply asks that its system be allowed to carry on and be excepted. That is why I move the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the manner in which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) moved his new Clause. I appreciate that he speaks, not for all people, but for a considerable number of people in Edinburgh who do not want to change the system. A lot of people do not want to change anything. But we do. A considerable number of people want to change the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked who support the Bill or who do not support the Bill. I have had representations,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
although certainly not from organised bodies in Edinburgh. However, I think the hon. Gentleman would agree that my guess that the Edinburgh Labour Party would want a change to be made is fairly accurate. This would be my guess. The party represents a substantial proportion of people in Edinburgh and I have received representations from other parts of the country—Glasgow, Aberdeen and the other places involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not for a moment deny that the gentlemen to whom the hon. Gentleman referred—these ex officio members—have done and are doing valuable work for the community. Despite the hon. Gentleman's remarks about my comments when introducing the Bill, I assure him that I was quoting from historical documents. The words I used were the words of a commentator of the time. Although these ex officio members are doing this valuable work, they are not elected people in the ordinary sense of the word in that they are not elected in the way that ordinary councillors are elected. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that they should not have the same full rights as councillors elected by the majority of ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work that these gentlemen do will continue to be done under the Bill as amended. We are merely taking from them their right to vote in full council. The valuable work which they have been doing and which is appreciated by the community will, as I say, continue to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why the 1947 Act did not tackle this problem, although a Labour Government were then in power. I took the precaution of reading the exchanges which took place when that Measure was going through. The matter was raised by Mr. Andrew Gilzean at the time. He was the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. He raised precisely the point which I am raising and the argument of the then Secretary of State was that it was a consolidation Measure agreed by both parties and that he would, therefore, be going back on an undertaking which had been given behind the scenes. That was why it was not done at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not expect hon. Gentlemen opposite to believe me when
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I say that this measure is not inspired exclusively by party considerations, I would not deny that party considerations have played some part in my motivation. What happened in Glasgow is well known and I need not go over the history of that matter. For the reasons I have given, I suggest that these gentlemen should not be given the full power comparable with elected councillors in full council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, if one accepted the new Clause one would make an exception of one city. Imagine the feelings of Glasgow, Aberdeen and parts of Dundee if the new Clause were accepted and such an exception were made. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, having made his protest on behalf of the people he represents in Edinburgh, will not press the new Clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the position, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Perth are quite happy and do not mind this small change. Edinburgh, on the other hand, does not want the change. That is the reason for the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, one does not legislate in Parliament to please every local authority which makes representations. The hon. Gentleman has made his point. I fully understand it, but I hope that the Committee will see that if we are to apply this remedy fairly it must be applied comprehensively to all the local authorities concerned. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not press the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed at the reply which the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) who was fair and reasonable and moved the new Clause extremely well, if I may say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends have spoken about the fact that many of the local authorities involved look upon the compromise solution which has been offered as being better than nothing—that half a loaf is better than none. However, this does not apply to all of them, and Edinburgh is an exception. Edinburgh would like to keep the whole of its loaf. I think it is really for the hon. Gentleman who is promoting the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Bill to show good reason why Edinburgh should not keep the whole of its loaf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider that this is an unwarranted interference by a back bencher into a local authority's affairs without really having given any good justification for what he wants to see done. One wonders what his real motives are, and I, frankly, was rather relieved when he said that he was not inspired exclusively by party considerations. Well, he has not up to now said what has inspired him. I think it is up to him to do so before we meekly accept this half-loaf compromise which he has offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help feeling that one of his motives is his rather psychopathic hatred of anything to do with the past, or with tradition and history, and he automatically attempts to destroy anything which is old, and to have change for the sake of change, whether it is good or whether it is bad. It is not necessarily in the best interests of the cities involved at the present time. Frankly, I can understand why the hon. Gentleman gained the prominent position he did in one of to-day's daily newspapers, on the front page, and headed "The naggers". I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has seen this exciting article, but I understand how he comes to qualify for this position to-day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that he will seriously consider exempting Edinburgh. I do not see why it is necessary to have comprehensive legislation to deal identically with all these cities. They are not all identical in their make up. What right has he to start dictating the constitutional set-up of local authorities of Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been suggested that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) is alone in his support of the Bill. I assure hon. Gentlemen opposite that that is not so. Many of us supported the Bill as it was in its entirety. We are surprised at the action of our sea-green incorruptible, our Robespierre, in accepting the first Amendment. In going through the usual channels he has got himself trapped instead in the shifting quicksands of compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that there is no reason or even desire for the Bill and the change it will make. On the other hand, there is equally no reason for saying that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) necessarily reflects the views of Edinburgh, certainly not all of Edinburgh. The hon. Gentleman has not said why Edinburgh should be made an exception and while it would be wrong for me to impute any motives to hon. Gentlemen opposite—as they have tended to impute them on my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West—it would seem an odd coincidence that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman continues, would he not agree that it is normal for a man to be proved guilty, not for him to have to prove his innocence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not detract from the fact that the hon. Gentleman for Edinburgh, South has introduced a new Clause to exempt Edinburgh from the Bill but has not proved why that exception should be made. The onus of proof is on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite say that we are not concerned with history and tradition. On the contrary, the whole of history has consisted of getting rid of bad traditions and replacing them with good ones—such as the very good tradition of one man, one vote. I suggest that we stick to that. Since no argument has been adduced to show why Edinburgh should be made an exception, I trust that the processes of democracy will not be gutted in this way and that the Committee, including many hon. Gentlemen opposite, will reject the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it for me as a
<br><br><!-- lb -->
mere Glaswegian to come between my hon. Friends who represent Edinburgh constituencies and the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), but I am afraid that what I may say may result in my getting their wrath on my head and perhaps feeling that what I say is a stab in the back. Nevertheless, I must say certain things for the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) said that there had been no consultations and that the dean of guild and the people of Edinburgh were opposed to the Measure. I said in my earlier remarks that I had had consultations with all these bodies. I did not say that any of them would welcome the Bill. I do not think that any of my hon. Friends would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
welcome it, even if they accept it. This extract from a letter might help to make it possible for my hon. Friend to withdraw the new Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After a lengthy discussion it was unanimously agreed that arrangements should be made to compromise with Mr. Hamilton to the extent that the guild would agree that the Lord Dean's vote on the Council be forfeited but should be retained for all Committees to which he may be appointed. It was emphasised that this was the minimum power to enable the duties of the Lord Dean for Edinburgh to be carried out efficiently."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what the Bill does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend say from which body he received that letter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. The letter was sent to me and was signed by the clerk to the guildry in Edinburgh. It would be difficult to find a more official body than that to get the views of the gentlemen whom my hon. Friend represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the Bill, even as amended, is welcome, but merely that these gentlemen recognise the political facts of life and feel that they could work under this proposal. For that reason they are willing to accept it. Accordingly, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the new Clause and I apologise if at an earlier stage I did not deal with the matter as fully as I should have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to take part in these proceedings but since every other Edinburgh Member on this side of the Committee has spoken it would look bad if I did not put in a word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that Edinburgh Corporation would prefer to be excluded from these provisions. Let us be frank about that. It does not welcome the Bill and I understand that at one stage it was prepared to exercise every influence it could bring to bear to oppose it out and out. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) pointed out, it recognises the facts of life and, speaking for myself, I find it difficult to justify, in the case of unelected representatives, the full powers which are appropriate to a councillor. I would be the first to press that these ex officio officers should have substantial powers. They have done very useful work
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
in the past and such powers as are appropriate to the exercise of their functions must be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) on realising that what he is giving way to here is not pressure but the realisation on his part that if these officers are to exercise their functions properly they must be given certain powers. The powers preserved for them in the Bill are those which they must have if those functions are to be exercised properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend uses the word "unelected". It is important that it should be made clear that there is in this matter much more of an election than has been suggested this morning. The dean of guild is an elected member—admittedly elected by a very narrow section of the community. There is far more of an election in this matter, as my hon. and learned Friend will agree, than in the case of aldermanic representation which is so often used to bring in a majority for a Labour council in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. When I used the expression "unelected", I meant unelected in the sense in which councils are elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This being so, I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead has said. There have been discussions on this matter. My understanding of the position is that, if the Bill could not be prevented altogether, then some such compromise as has been reached should be accepted. This is the compromise which is appropriate to the proper exercise of the functions of these valuable officers on these town councils.

Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) will not press the new Clause, because it seems to me difficult to justify it simply on the ground that on one view at least Edinburgh Corporation would rather not have the Bill at all. I rather agree with the assertion that, if an exception is to be created to a general practice, the obligation is to justify the exception. With great respect to my hon. Friends who support the new Clause, it does not seem to me that that exception has been justified,

	<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(ADMISSIONS AND AGREEMENTS AS TO EVIDENCE IN SOLEMN PROCEDURE.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I shortly explain the purpose of the Clause? It is to enable parties to proceedings on indictment in Scotland to agree facts and documents which are not in dispute. The present law on this matter on indictment is governed by the provisions of Section 20 of the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act, 1933, as amended by Section 12 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1938. Those Sections make it possible in proceedings on indictment for parties to agree documents. Section 20(1) of the 1933 Act provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any trial on indictment it shall not be necessary for the prosecutor or the accused to prove any documents which are admitted by the other party, and copies of any documents may, where the parties so agree, be accepted as equivalent to the originals, provided that no such admission or agreement by the accused shall be accepted, except in a case in which he has legal assistance in his defence."</p></blockquote>
That is as far as the law of procedure goes as respects proceedings on indictment. It covers only agreement as to documents. It does not cover agreement as to facts which are not in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time in summary procedure this has been operated effectively in terms of Section 36 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland) Act, 1954, which provides that in summary procedure both documents which are not in dispute and facts which are not in dispute can be agreed by the parties, provided always—this is an essential safeguard in all these cases—that the accused is legally represented. Section 36(1) of the 1954 Act provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall not be necessary in any summary prosecution, for either party to lead proof of any fact which is admitted by the opposite party, or to prove any documents the terms and application of which are not in dispute, and copies of any documents may, by agreement of the parties, be accepted as equivalent to the originals: Provided that this subsection shall not apply unless the accused has legal assistance in his defence."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
For a number of years it has been possible in summary procedure for parties—the prosecutor on the one hand, and the accused through his legal representative, on the other hand,—to narrow down the issue which is in dispute between the parties by agreeing that such matters as are in dispute shall be dealt with in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In proceedings on indictment a great deal of time is taken up by the prosecutor proving facts which at the moment cannot be agreed but which may not be in dispute. This is aggravated by the two-witness rule, the requirement of the law of evidence in Scotland that there must be corroboration of any material fact. The effect of this is that in many cases a great deal of time is taken up proving facts which are not in dispute. A great deal of public money is expended on bringing witnesses, sometimes from all over the country, and a great deal of the time of jurors as well as of the court is taken up in proving these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Clause is to make it possible for the prosecutor and the accused through his legal representative to agree facts which are not in dispute. The Clause in effect re-enacts the provisions of the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act with regard to documents. The purpose is so that the whole law on this matter of agreement in solemn procedure can be found in the one piece of legislation and so that it will not be necessary for anyone concerned to go first to this Measure and then to the 1933 Act, as amended by the 1938 Act. In other words, this is a consolidating Measure, to the extent that it introduces a new principle in solemn procedure, namely, proceedings on indictment, whereby facts not in dispute can be agreed, and it consolidates the existing law with regard to documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I close my submissions on this matter, may I make some observations on drafting? I must accept responsibility for the drafting of the Clause. When I studied it, it seemed to me that there were provisions here which could be improved. I would be grateful if the Minister of State would in due course help me through the Parliamentary draftsmen. The last part of subsection (1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and a copy of any document may, where they so agree, be accepted as equivalent to the original document".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
That is, in effect, repeated at the end of subsection (3). Subject to such advice as the Minister of State may give on this matter, I should have thought that it is not necessary to have both provisions in the Bill. It may be possible to dispense with one of them. I should have thought that it would be best to delete the first provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also occurred to me that it might be wiser to include in the Bill the additional provision added by the 1938 Act to Section 20 of the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act, 1933. The provision which was added to the 1933 Act reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any reference in this section to proof or admission of a document shall include a reference to proof or admission as to the person by whom a document was written, executed, or received, and as to the time and place of such writing, execution, or receipt."</p></blockquote>
This is a provision which it might be advisable to include in this consolidating Measure. I should be grateful if the Minister of State would consider this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had my attention drawn through an article in the 	<i>Scots Law Times</i> to the fact that difficulties may arise if an accused through his legal representative agrees a joint minute in this way and then subsequently dispenses with the services of his legal advisers and continues the case on his own behalf. I can see that a difficulty could conceivably arise. If a joint minute had been agreed in this way and then, after the prosecutor had opened his case, the accused dispensed with his legal advisers and sought to withdraw the minute, difficulties might well arise. On the other hand, this has operated perfectly satisfactorily in summary procedure where the same problems could arise. Perhaps it is not necessary to introduce a safeguarding provision of that character. I mention it as an aspect of the Bill which may be the subject of criticism. It may at a later stage be necessary to consider this and, if necessary, put in amending provisions. I have no desire to take up the time of the Committee further on this Clause this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

quite happy to see it become law. I have no doubt that the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), whose Bill it is, will consider the points which have been raised before the Bill goes to another place.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak on behalf of the other half of the legal profession in commendation of the Bill, which will be particularly useful in solemn procedure cases. The law in this respect has for some time been unsatisfactory, especially in cases of fraud, which are exceedingly complicated and can involve weeks and weeks for the hearing and literally thousands of documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember one case which I had myself in which a sub-postmaster was charged with fraud. Literally thousands of documents had to be produced, and there was a total of some 10 Post Office officials, some of whom had to come from London. Under the proposal of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) there is no reason why those documents should not be admitted, and so save about three days of the time of the Court, and instead of wasting the time of the prosecutor. I hope that this useful Measure will be agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would take the opportunity of congratulating the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). I am not a lawyer or connected with the law but one can see that the time of the Court and the length of the proceedings will be eased greatly by the introduction of the proposed procedure, which is already followed in other courts. The solemn procedure is that in which a jury is employed. I understand that the proposal is that, where the solicitors on either side are mutually agreed and with the knowledge of the court, certain facts and information are accepted. The field for consideration of the court is thus narrowed to a few points on which there is dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands drew attention to the repetition of the phraseology at the end of subsection (3) of the Clause. I noticed this myself, but since I am not knowledgeable in the law I wondered whether it arose from the fact that subsection (1) related

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The task of explaining the Bill has fallen to me because my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) is unfortunately in hospital. This is a case where greatness has been thrust upon me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause extends the provisions contained in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to the Solicitors (Scotland) Act, 1949, which provide for the suspension from practice of solicitors who become bankrupt, and for the solicitors to give notice to the Registrar of solicitors of the fact. In the case where a judicial factor has been appointed on the estate of a solicitor under Section 15 of the Solicitors (Scotland) Act, 1958, the solicitor can, notwithstanding that fact, still continue to practice. It is clearly undesirable that a solicitor whose business has become embarrassed to such an extent that it has become necessary for a judicial factor to be appointed in connection with it should be able to continue in practice. The Clause is designed to deal with this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele) on undertaking to explain the Bill. It is a complicated little Measure of very great importance for the solicitors' profession in Scotland. I can speak with assurance about this because the Bill is welcomed in every respect by the Law Society of Scotland, the body charged with regulation of the solicitor branch of the legal profession in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the disciplinary committee of the solicitors' profession was set up it was envisaged that solicitors who became bankrupt should not continue to practice. It was found later on that solicitors could get themselves into a very embarrased situation without necessarily going bankrupt, particularly if they failed to comply with the rules laid down for the profession by the Law Society of Scotland. The Society made provision for the appointment of a judicial factor to take charge of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
their affairs. What was envisaged was that, if a man got himself into a mess, even though he was not actually bankrupt, he might be allowed to continue in practice, but this is obviously very undesirable.

The officers of the Law Society of Scotland are behind the Bill to deal with this anomaly. The Society considers it undesirable that a man whose affairs have got into a mess should continue in practice. I commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a criticism of Scottish Members that the Clause should be necessary. I must confess I would think that the eagle eye of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) and of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland would not have permitted to pass the Clause in the 1958 Bill which the Clause I am now explaining is intended to amend. It is rather amusing that it should happen in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Section 17(1) of that Act is a provision as to the keeping of the roll to enable the registrar, for the purpose of maintaining the roll in an up-to-date state, to send to any solicitor on the roll at his address as shown on the roll, a letter enquiring whether the solicitor, who may have happened to forget to pay his fee or whatever may be necessary, wishes to continue to be included in the roll. It is intimated that if no reply is returned to that letter within six months, the name may be removed. If the solicitor replies to the letter to the effect that he does not wish his name to be continued, the fact that a reply has been sent means that the registrar is unable to take his name off the roll. The Clause is intended to overcome this anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist the chance of echoing the rebuke which has been rightly given by the hon. Member for

Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele). It is not often that one has an opportunity to find the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) was clearly not doing his homework on the 1958 Bill when it came up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So sweet has been the mood of the Committee this morning that I decided that I would break my habit and not refer to debates on previous Measures. I can hardly believe that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East did not speak on that Bill. It would be extraordinary for there to be any Bill relating to Scotland on which he did not speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, at length. But even the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point, but I am not surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) did not trouble about this matter and interrupt the proceedings in 1958, because the Government of the day were answerable for omissions of this kind. As the Section reads to me, as a layman, it is perfectly sensible, but to the legal profession the meaning must be crystal clear. If one sends a letter asking someone if he wants his name continued, and the writer gets a letter back, the inference is that the suggestion is accepted. This Clause is to correct a simple omission. To the ordinary layman the Section as it reads seems perfectly sensible. I join with my hon. Friend in saying that I wonder that such a Clause should be necessary in the Bill at all because ordinary laymen would accept the Section as it is as making common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend appears in this Committee in two different hats. On one occasion he will give a dissertation on the actual meaning of the words. He has repeatedly said he is only a layman, but after twenty years in the Scottish Standing Committee I would hazard a guess that he has a fair knowledge of the law. The Clause seems quite clear to me, that if no reply is returned to any such letter then within the period his name may be removed, but if a reply of

any kind comes back it means the registrar is not permitted to remove the name from the roll. I appreciate the effect of this new Clause is to bring clarity to the provisions of the 1958 Act and I hope we can now have the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause demonstrates the muddle lawyers can get into if they are left to their own devices. It is partly to prevent this sort of thing that this Committee operates. My right hon. Friend and myself did our best to prevent this kind of thing from happening but we cannot be held responsible for everything. As the hon. Gentleman knows, from the many columns of Hansard we filled in searching out these weaknesses, this task was a pretty mammoth one, under the last Government. The hon. Gentleman appreciates that, because he seems recently to have read as much of it as he could. I make no apology for not having seen this little mistake.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T.

If a client has sold his house and arranges to buy another, and his solicitor dies before the transactions are complete, the position may well be that the solicitor has received payment, on behalf of the client, of the price of the client's old house, and then dies at the point at which the price of the new house is required to be paid. The client then finds himself in the position that the new house cannot be paid for because the funds out of which the price is to be paid are in the solicitor's bank account to which resource cannot be

It seems to be rather a minor administrative point but it is not really.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the most important Clause in this Measure, and perhaps I will be forgiven if I put on the record its actual provisions. It deals with interest on clients' money. The object of the Clause is to resolve the problems created by the decision in Brown v. the Commissioners' of Inland Revenue. That case affirmed the principle for a fiduciary relationship existing between solicitor and client and said that in consequence a solicitor might not, without full knowledge and free assent of his clients, obtain any pecuniary benefits from him other than proper charges and disbursements. The point of that case was that it applied that principle to clients' money in the hands of the solicitor which the solicitor puts on deposit in his own name for a number of clients generally and which in consequence earned interest. It was held that the solicitor must account for that interest, irrespective of the difficulties of apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be made abundantly clear that the solicitors profession completely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
accept the decision in Brown. There is not the slightest desire on the part of the Law Society in Scotland, or on the part of the legal practitioners to repeal the decision in that case. On the contrary it is the foundation of the practice of a solicitor that this relationship exists and should be maintained. The Clause to which the assent of Parliament is now sought is designed, not to repeal this case, but in some respect to put additional obligations on to solicitors and to define the proper way in which the principles of the case should be applied in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands today the position is that a solicitor who receives clients' moneys is under obligation to put them in a separate bank account, apart from his own moneys. There is no general obligation on the solicitor to put clients' moneys on deposit or to earn interest upon them, but if he does he must account for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty in the practical application of this principle relates to sums which are too small to be put on deposit, or sums which are held for too short a period to justify their being put on deposit. A solicitor will have in his clients' accounts a large number of small sums in respect of rents, small debts collected, maintenance payments or income of a client. It would be ridiculous to suppose that there could be any possibility of that money being put on deposit, earning interest which should be accounted for to the client. There is the other extreme, of sums which are large enough in themselves to be justifiably to put on deposit but which are being held for too short a period. A typical example is in a conveyancing practice where a large number of conveyancing matters are always going on, such as the buying and selling of houses of £3,000 or £4,000 in value. The solicitor will have these sums coming in and will be paying them out again within a few days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two elements in this matter which have to be taken into account—the size of the amount and the period over which it will be wanted. The problem arises in this way. Although these sums, whether by reason of their amount or by reason of the period during which they are held, cannot properly or reasonably be put on deposit in the name or
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
for behoof of individual clients it is possible for a solicitor, prudently to look at the sum total of his clients' accounts and say, "I think I could safely put a fifth, a quarter or a third of this money on deposit for a period of time and earn interest upon it." The difficulty, in practice, of applying the decision in Brown's case is that it is impossible to calculate, what, if any, part of the interest earned could be attributable to the small sums to which reference has been made. It is impractical to do the arithmetic and work it out in that way. Therefore if a solicitor is to comply strictly with the full principle of Brown's case there is only one things he can do and that is not to put the money on deposit at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, nothing is earned, the clients gain nothing and the solicitor loses a certain amount of interest. The only party who gains is the bank, which will have the money on current account without paying any interest at all. It can probably be said that it was certainly not the intention of the other place, in laying down the very right and proper kind of principle established in Brown's case that the client should get nothing, that the solicitor should lose and that the bank should gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedy proposed for this situation is that where it is fair the client's money shall be put on deposit in the name of, or for behoof of the client. A legal obligation to put the money on deposit on this respect will be created in the right and proper case, where it is fair to the client. It is also proposed that if the solicitor does not put the money on deposit, in a case where he should have done so, then he shall still be bound to account to the client for that amount, with the interest which would have been earned if he had put the money on deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to two factors, the amount of any particular sum and the period during which it is held. Each of these is relevant in coming to a conclusion as to whether, in fairness to the client, the money should or should not be put on deposit. Broadly speaking, rough justice might be done if it were said it would be unnecessary to put the money on deposit or to account for the interest if the sum were less than £500 or the period over which it was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
held were less than eight weeks or two months.

Neither of these factors can be regarded as absolute. In some cases where the sum would be less than £500, say £450, it might be available for six months, and clearly that money ought to be put on deposit in the name or for behoof of the individual client. The solution proposed is that above the limit of £500 or two months there shall be an absolution obligation to put the money on deposit in the name or for behoof of the individual client. Below those limits there is an obligation to put the money on deposit where it is fair and right for the solicitor to do so in the interests of the client. The means whereby it is proposed to carry that principle into effect is this Clause, coupled with rules which the Law Society of Scotland would make under the Clause. The rules made by the Law Society must be approved by the Lord President of the Court of Session before they come into operation, and I have the authority of the Law Society to say that a rule has been drafted to deal with the matter and the Lord President of the Court of Session has seen and approved it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say this is a Clause of the very greatest importance, not only to the solicitors' branch of the legal profession in Scotland but to many hundreds of thousands of clients affected by it. The Clause has received anxious consideration by the Law Society, not only in Scotland but in England, and I have been personally involved in a great many discussions on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cardinal principle is that a solicitor shall not benefit from his clients, except in respect of remuneration for work done. It has always been understood by solicitors in most countries that any in-interest which accrues from clients' money should, wherever practical, go to the benefit of the client concerned. Far be it from me to blame the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) for having failed in previous debates to see that the circumstances might arise where interest would accrue to the solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of those things one learns by experience. After all, the rules for the solicitors' profession have been built up over a great many years. The first
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
thing that happened when these rules were made was that solicitors had to keep their clients' money absolutely distinct from their own. That has been the rule for many years now and a solicitor has to produce to the Law Society every year when he asks for his practice certificate, a certificate from an accountant to the effect that he has done this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

A solicitor, being a man of business who feels that he must have the interests of his client at heart, has for many years been in the practice of looking at his client's bank account to see what money was there which could be profitably invested, even for a short time. If a substantial sum of his client's money is involved, it is obviously of advantage to put that money in the bank with a deposit receipt. The practice has been in cases involving substantial sums to put the deposit receipt in his own name and the interest on that deposit is that of the client. That is universal practice in the solicitors' profession in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, in the course of time, a practising solicitor has passing through his hands a vast number of small sums. They may range from pennies to substantial sums, but he may have them for only a day or two, or he may have a comparatively small sum for, say, six months. It is impossible for him to account to his client from day to day for these sums. The average solicitor, even a small solicitor, will normally have to the credit of his clients in the bank account perhaps several thousand pounds. These small sums, taken together, come to a substantial amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this money is kept in an ordinary current account in the bank, the only beneficiary is the bank, which gets the use of the money without paying interest on it. Therefore, a prudent solicitor, as a man of business, says, "It is stupid that we should have this large sum sterilised in a bank account when it might be earning interest". It has become the practice in some solicitor's offices in Scotland, but by no means in all—some solicitors feel strongly that the Clause is undesirable—to invest a proportion of the balance in the client's bank account on a deposit receipt. Some solicitors have not done that. They have kept the money in the current account
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
without getting interest on it. This practice is perfectly proper, but the difficulty is what is to happen to the interest on this money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Brown, to whom reference has been made this morning, is a solicitor in Scotland. He conformed to the usual practice. This was done without any question being raised for a number of years, and very few people consider this to be an improper practice. When Mr. Brown had to account to the Inland Revenue for the interest on this money, the Inland Revenue did not dispute the fact that it was Mr. Brown's money. It said, "It is your money and this is interest on invested money. You must pay tax as if it were earned income". Mr. Brown said, "That is not the case. I have all the trouble of keeping the accounts for these clients. This consists of a good deal of work, and the interest on this money is a fit and proper remuneration for the work which I have to do".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the generally held view in the profession in Scotland and in England—that this money was proper remuneration for the work. Mr. Brown said to the Inland Revenue, "This is earned income and I should be taxed accordingly". Mr. Brown and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue disputed the matter and it went to the Court of Session. So far as I can remember, the Court of Session found in Mr. Brown's favour and said that it was earned income. But the Commissioners of Inland Revenue were not satisfied with that. This was too good a thing for them to miss and they appealed to the House of Lords which reversed the decision of the Court of Session and found that this was neither earned income nor unearned income. It was not Mr. Brown's income: it belonged to his clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Brown and the Law Society said, "We are up against a difficulty. We do not dispute the decision of the House of Lords. This is the property of the clients, but it is absolutely impossible, even with a computer, to divide the money among the clients to whom it belongs". The solicitors' branch of the legal profession in both England and Scotland—a decision of the House of Lords applies to both Kingdoms—found itself in a quandry about what should be done. Discussions
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
went on in the two Law Societies for well over a year to try to resolve the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one school of thought in the Law Societies which was very proper and strict and said, "If this is clients' money it must be treated as such. There is therefore only one thing to do—to refrain from lodging any money in the bank on deposit". However, that was met by the argument that if that were done the banks would make a great deal of money out of it because the interest which should go to the clients would go to the banks, which are probably the least deserving people of all because they do nothing for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, discussions went on for well over a year to try to find a solution. I believe that the proper solution has been found in this Clause so ably-explained by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele). The difficulty is that it is impossible to apportion the money among the clients. There are obviously situations in which a solicitor has a duty to invest his clients' money if he is looking after his clients' interests properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has laid down a general principle about what should be done, but it is impossible to lay down anything hard and fast in the matter. The rules to which the hon. Gentleman referred propose that the ultimate question of whether the accounting is reasonable or not should be left to the Law Society and that the client should have a right of appeal to the Law Society if he thinks his solicitor has acted improperly by not investing the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Clause will be to tighten the obligations of a solicitor in this respect. If interest is earned on clients' money in the hands of a solicitor he has a duty to account to his client for it. However, in the past, if he failed to invest his client's money there was no duty on him to pay interest to his client in respect of that failure. The effect of the Clause will be to impose a duty on a solicitor to pay interest to his client on any sizeable sum over any sizeable period, whether he has invested the money or not. If he has been careless enough not to invest the money, he must pay the interest out of his own pocket. This satisfies the honour of all solicitors—and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
think that here I speak for every solicitor in both England and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Clause similar to this has been applied to England in the Solicitors Bill which has just passed through their Lordships' House, having first passed through the House of Commons, and which should receive the Royal Assent very soon if it has not yet done so. The position has been dealt with in England. Thanks to the good offices of the lion. Member for Dunbartonshire, West, it should be applied to Scotland to the great advantage of solicitors and their clients in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one distinction between the Scottish position and the English position which it is proper to mention. In the English Bill there is provision only for the deposit of sums received on behalf of clients. There is a stricter provision in Scotland, because the intention is that solicitors in Scotland should be under an obligation to deposit, not only money received on behalf of clients, but balances received on behalf of clients. The reason is that solicitors in Scotland have acted more as businessmen for their clients than solicitors in England. It has been customary for Scottish solicitors to act as factors. If over a period a solicitor gathers a multitude of small sums for his client which together amount to a sizeable sum, he should be under an obligation to account to his client for interest on the total sum, whether it is deposited or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West, I have been authorised to say that the Law Society of Scotland thoroughly approves of the Clause, and I have the greatest confidence in commending it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clear up one point in the hon. Gentleman's speech. He said that here was evidence that solicitors objected to this Clause. My understanding is that there is no evidence of any objection by solicitors to the Clause. The hon. Gentleman said that many solicitors in Scotland objected to taking interest on clients' money at all and then he went on to say something about the objection. Perhaps one objection ran into the other. My understanding is that no solicitor has objected to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I did not make myself clear. So far as I know, no solicitor in Scotland or England has any objection to the Clause. However, certain solicitors in Scotland had scruples at an earlier stage about any proposal that a solicitor should benefit from interest on clients' money, but these scruples have been overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele) on the extreme lucidity with which he explained an extremely involved legal matter. I understood him to mention two figures—£500 and two months. I understand that there would be virtually a mandatory obligation on a solicitor to put on deposit a sum of money if it is over £500, even if it is to be invested for only six weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is "£500 and two months".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the impression that if it was over £500 but under two months there was an obligation, and that if it was under £500 but over two months there was also an obligation. If the Minister is correct—and it would surely be improper for me to suggest that he is not—I was merely going to ask what happens if a solicitor has £450 for less than two months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The absolute obligation is in respect of £500 for over two months. Above the limit of £500 and two months there is an absolute obligation on the solicitor to put the money on deposit in the name of the individual client. Below that limit there is an obligation on him to put the money on deposit if it is fair and reasonable for him so to do in the interests of the client.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if about £100,000 is involved over only a six week period there is no obligation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that if £100,000 was involved it was fair and reasonable for the solicitor to do so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is not mandatory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be covered by the rules, and one would expert the solicitor to do so. But if he did not do so, the client could go to the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) asked a question on which I would like to comment further. I assure my hon. Friend that while solicitors, like many other people, might not take the trouble of uttering their criticisms or putting them in writing, there are some solicitors who are not happy about the Clause. However, I will not oppose the Clause but merely state the criticisms they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They ask, first, why the present rules have not been enforced to a greater extent, making unnecessary the introduction of this provision. I understand that rules are already in existence and my solicitor friends wonder whether, if those rules were further exercised, the rules mentioned in the Clause would be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be remembered—as we must when discussing a provision like this—that solicitors are also bankers, perhaps in a temporary sense. While I agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West that most solicitors are prudent, like the members of other professions, including politicians, it is resented when the whole group to which they belong is let down by a member of it who acts imprudently. There have been two or three recent cases of embezzlement which have brought great attention to the manner in which these finances are handled by solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When can we expect the new rules to be available? We have been told that they will be made in very high quarters, but my hon. Friend said that as well as determining the placing into deposit account of certain moneys, they will also determine what is fair. Will they be rules of the Law Society and will they, as suggested, be for £500 and a period of two months? I hope that the position will be made perfectly clear because, if it is, it might go some way towards eradicating the doubts which exist in the minds of some solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter which disturbs some solicitors is the fact that, however simple a scheme is introduced, it will inevitably mean a great amount of administrative work for them. I agree with the purpose of the Clause and that the interests of the client must be paramount. Whatever further disability or inconvenience is created for solicitors, it is in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
interest of the Law Society itself that, from the point of view of this important matter, a method should be devised. If we can be given further information on these points I would be grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient if the hon. Gentleman replies after I have commented further because I must stress the point of some substance to which the Minister replied. I should have thought that if we are dividing into two compartments what should be mandatory and what should be obligatory—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is obligatory is mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said, in effect, "You can leave this. This is clearly fair and reasonable".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used almost precisely those words when I spoke about £100,000 being held for five or six weeks. That is what the Minister said was fair and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not sure to what the hon. Gentleman was referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought, if we are going to say that it is to be £500 and eight weeks, that the rule would be better to say "Over £500 or"—not "and"—because we should not have a dual qualification, because this then covers the question of what is fair and reasonable; and clearly £100,000 for six weeks is fair and reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must then come down the scale. Is £1,000 for six weeks fair and reasonable? Why have a dual qualification? Why not say that if one holds over £500 for a period of less than eight weeks there is a mandatory obligation and that if one holds less than £500 for a period greater than eight weeks, the same thing happens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is mandatory if it is fair and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Minister of State has made many speeches in his day. We have sat and listened to them not once or 50 times, but 150 times. Time and again he has said that it is much better to go by the writing of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Bill and leave aside interpretation of things like what is reasonable and so on. Time and again he has referred to various people's judgments and he always used to say when in Opposition that those on the Government side were more unreliable when it came to deciding what was fair and reasonable. For that reason, I cannot understand why he is now taking a firm stand, if that is what he is taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the Minister answered this question in the first place because I directed my remarks to the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Thomas Steele) who had spoken with extreme clarity. If the Minister will excuse my saying so, his intervention has plunged the Committee into chaos and we do not know what is happening. I regret that, in saying that, I was not able to obtain in my voice the ring which the Minister used to have in his when he made similar statements in Opposition. I suggest that it should read "£500 or" rather than "£500 and" and perhaps the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, West will continue his lucid explanation of this aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that there has been some confusion in the minds of some hon. Members. Because of the shortness of time and because I did not wish to delay the Committee I deleted a number of paragraphs from my brief—and I make no bones about the fact that I have a brief in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), in connection with his question, that there are no such rules at present dealing with this matter. That being so, I cannot understand how that part of his question arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To comment on the point which has held the attention of the Committee, I have a copy of the rules with me and the rule on this matter has been seen and approved by the Lord President of the Court of Session. In regard to the putting of money on deposit, no bank will pay interest on such money unless it has been deposited over 30 days. The rule is quite clear—it first of all places a general obligation on all solicitors. In other words, where
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a solicitor holds money for or on account of a client, and 	<i>(b)</i> having regard to the amount of such money and the length of time for which it or any part of it is likely to be held, it is reasonable so to do,
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
he shall so soon as practicable place such money or, as the case may be, such part thereof in a separate deposit account at a bank, for the benefit of his client …"</p></blockquote>
There is, therefore, a general obligation that the solicitor should act in the best interests of his client in this way. Then it becomes an obligation on the solicitor, if the sum exceeds £500 or is going to be held for a period of longer than eight weeks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Or"? The hon. Gentleman said "£500 or", not "£500 and".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the hon. Gentleman said "or".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steele</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I did, I apologise. It becomes a definite obligation on him that where it is £500 or exceeds £500 and it will be held for at least two months he must place it in a deposit account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be understood that to go with these rules there are sanctions being placed on the solicitor as well in this matter. One sanction is that the Law Society may be asked by a client to give a certificate as to whether the solicitor was right or wrong in not accounting for interest or not putting his money on deposit. Thus, if the sum was £450 and was held by the solicitor for a period of seven weeks, the client himself, feeling that this was unreasonable, has the right to go to the Law Society and put his case. If it is found that it was unreasonable for the solicitor not to have put the money on deposit during that period, the solicitor must bear the interest himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules are so designed that solicitors will not be asked to put small sums of money for individual clients on deposit for short periods. We should consider this in the knowledge that this is not something which is being left entirely to the solicitors themselves but that in the period ahead the Law Society, safeguarding the interests of clients generally, will be looking at it carefully. I am certain that if the Law Society finds any difficulties arising it can provide new rules, which would have to be approved by the Lord President but without having to go to Parliament for further legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
