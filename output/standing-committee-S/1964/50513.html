	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [12th May],</i> In page 7, line 20, after "Board", to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall prepare a list of all lands over 500 acres in extent owned in the Highlands and Islands and of the names of the owners of such lands, showing the rateable value and the acreage owned in each case, and further"—	<i>[Mr. Rankin.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday I made what I hoped were non-party and non-controversial points. I do not wish to detain the Committee for too long this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Second Reading debate I referred to the 1873 survey, and the Secretary of State indicated later how inaccurate the results of that survey probably are now. No one knows for certain how inaccurate they are. Even landowners do not seem to know exactly how much land they own. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), in a discussion we had a few weeks ago, admitted that. He may recall a conversation that we had with a B.B.C. man, who was obviously very knowledgeable about the position in the Highlands and who, in the course of the conversation, stated that he had conducted a survey in Ross-shire to find out who exactly owned what. He indicated that he could find without difficulty who owned 85 per cent. of the land, but could not find out, no matter how he tried, who owned the other 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may or may not be a general problem in the Highlands. If it is, I cannot but feel that the activities of the proposed Highland Board will be thwarted or at least retarded by lack of knowledge of who owns the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might quote from one or two very interestng articles in 	<i>The Observer</i>
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
	<i>Weekend Review</i> of 21st March, 1965. The article is headed "Who Owns Britain?" and it begins with the quotation, "God gave the land to the people". Somebody else has been busy since then. I want to give the land back to the people. My Amendment is intended as a first step in that direction. The writer of the article in to which I am referring, Mr. Mervyn Jones, quotes a letter which he said he had received from Sir Donald Cameron of Lochiel, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At a very rough guess I would say that my estate today contains about 130,000 acres.… I have not for some years made an estimate of the acreage. However, I should think that the above figure is not very far out."</p></blockquote>
This example shows how difficult this subject is, and it is not explained by the records. It is not at all clear how much the individual landowners own. With my customary diligence I asked the Library staff of the House to go into this question. I subsequently received from a Member of the Research Department this letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I mentioned in my letter of 1st July that I had written to the Scottish Landowners' Federation in connection with your inquiry. I have received a reply which, as you will see from the copy enclosed, is a 'nil' return. The Scottish National Trust were more helpful and I also enclose a copy of the Factor's letter."</p></blockquote>
From this it appears that the biggest owners are the Scottish authorities, including the Forestry Commission, the Agriculture Department and other Scottish authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from the National Trust could not be less forthcoming than that of the Scottish Landowners' Federation. Dated 9th July, 1964, the National Trust for Scotland says in its letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We thank you for your letter of 7th July inquiring about the largest landowners in Scotland. We presume you refer to acreage rather than to rental. We naturally do not know the size of other estates in Scotland, but would imagine that the largest landowner in Scotland is probably the Secretary of State through the lands administered by the Forestry Commission or by the Department of Agriculture. Our own acreage spread over some 36 properties aggregates about 70,800 acres … Among the largest landowners must be: The Duke of Buccleuch, the Countess of Seafield, A. C. Farquharson of Invercauld, Westminster Estates in Sutherland."</p></blockquote>
This is all the information one gets from the National Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I sought to find out who the landowners were who voted in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
Burmah Oil debate in the House of Lords I just could not get the information. There is no record on which to base that inquiry at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Figures are bandied about concerning the extent of the acreage owned by certain people. I have seen figures for the Duke of Buccleuch giving 220,000 acres, for the Countess of Seafield 213,000 acres, for Lord Lovat 190,000 acres, and for Westminster Estates in Sutherland 98,000 acres. I do not know whether the figures are accurate, but it is clear, whatever the acreage, that it is important to find out who the landlowners are in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will confirm that undercurrents of opposition are developing towards preventing the proposed Highland Board from doing what we all hope it will be able to do. I would quote from an article in the 	<i>Inverness Courier</i> of 24th July last. It was written before the General Election and before the Highland Development Bill had been presented. It was in correspondence, following my quoting an article in the Second Reading debate. The correspondence quoted the writer of the original article in the 	<i>Inverness Courier</i> of 24th July last, in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Signs have not been wanting recently that some owners of great sporting estates, alien and indigenous alike, are marshalling their forces quietly, but nevertheless determinedly and insidiously, in order to ensure that the vast areas which they own by virtue of wealth or accident of birth will be kept as private preserves for thier own enjoyment, irrespective of what the national interest may require or demand."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what the politics of the 	<i>Inverness Courier</i> are. I am pretty sure that they are not Left; they may be Radical or Liberal, which is the worst of all possible politics. Nevertheless, that is rather a significant quotation, coming before the General Election and before the details of the Bill were announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same writer quoted the 	<i>Highland Herald</i> of 30th July as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is certainly not Socialists or Liberals who are objecting to the further development of hydro-electric schemes; who own vast deer forests; who erect signs in lonely places prohibiting camping, caravanning and fishing. These are high-ranking Tory pursuits. We know of one powerful landlord whose properties stretch across Scotland and at the mouth
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
of every glen are his notices warning off those who would camp or tarry awhile."</p></blockquote>
These are the people whom we want to put in their places, and who must be put in their places if the Bill is to be as effective as we wish. If development takes place on the scale that we wish and hope, there will be a quite substantial increase in land values. We saw that in Fort William and we see it, not only in the Highlands but in Fife, as a direct consequence of the Forth Road Bridge. As development goes on, there will be large unearned incomes accruing. The proposed Land Commission Bill will deal with that, I hope, but it is important for us to find out to whom these increments are accruing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no wish to detain the Committee unduly. My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Scotland will no doubt argue that the point of my Amendment is covered by general powers for obtaining information, but I would ask him, if the Highland Board want to develop, say, that 15 per cent. of Ross-shire which no one knows who owns. How does it set about it if it cannot find the owners? I believe there are powers to enable the public to acquire land compulsorily when the ownership of it is not known and cannot be determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is, if the Minister of State and the Secretary of State feel that to try to cover the Highlands with the kind of survey indicated in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> article of Tuesday, 11th May, is impracticable at this season, or would be too costly or too diversionary of the Highland Board's activity, I would ask them if they would consider the desirability of undertaking a pilot scheme in one or more counties to see what the difficulties are and what the results might be. It is for these purposes and more as a probing effort that I put down my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would address my remarks to the Amendment which was moved at our last meeting by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). As far as I can understand it, the motive power behind it is a genuine interest to find who is the owner of land. The hon. Member for Govan said it was impossible to find the owners and their acreage of Scottish land. I should not have thought this was the case. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) intervened, in what I thought was a telling intervention, that he thought each local authority had a complete list of valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be surprised, and perhaps the Minister can allay my surprise when he replies, if one could not find at any county office the valuation roll showing the names of the owners, the occupiers and the rateable values of the land in the county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But not the acreage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essential item, the total number of acres held, is not on the roll in a valuation book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. I am just coming round to the point. There is no acreage given in the valuation roll. I had not appreciated that acreage is really the important subject we are discussing. I am glad to have discovered that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would therefore be very much more useful if the Amendment did not contain the limitation of 500 acres. It would not be an easy task, but I imagine that the county valuation rolls of all the counties covered by the Bill could be bound together in one mammoth volume—it would be very heavy indeed—and one could ascertain the rateable values, but not the acreage. To extract from the valuation roll the names of people with acreages of over 500 would be difficult. I do not say that this would be an impossible task because there is another source of information, namely, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. In, I would say, 99 cases out of every 100 the Department, in its 4th June returns, gets the acreages of all subjects. Therefore, it would not be impossible to marry them with the valuation rolls, although it would be a job to limit this proposal to properties of over 500 acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is even thinking of doing what is suggested—I doubt very much whether he is—I would make two objections. First, the acreages given in the returns of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are anything but reliable. I dare say my right hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) will remember a case which I put to him about a Government Department, namely, the Forestry Commission, which sold a property to a private individual. It said that the property constituted so many thousand acres. The person concerned then found that the Commission was 3,500 acres out in its assessment of the area. I dare say that this is a fairly glaring example, but I do not believe that it is unique. If this is an example of the accuracy of the returns I do not think that it is of enormous advantage to obtain them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wililam Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us what action was taken to rectify the situation and to ascertain the true position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to enter into a discussion about what action was taken on that occassion, which is now three years ago, you, Mr. Steele, would quickly rise from your Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his Department have several things to do which are more important than marrying the valuation rolls to the returns of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. I have doubts about whether making straight, honest contact with the owner is the real motive power behind the Amendment. The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) has come completely clean about this. He wants to put the owners in their place and to expose them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the smiling benevolence with which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan treated the Committee as he spoke I think that he revealed his real motive when he went into the implications of the ownership of land. He did not say so, but he implied, that to own land was rather dirty. He mentioned hobby farmers having pedigree herds. He tried to build up a picture of a decadent, lotus-eating society. By far the biggest majority—if not all—of the pedigree herds in the crofting counties are owned and managed by very severe, hard-headed people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I have listened with quietness and patience, but not acceptance, to this personal attack. Are personal attacks in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personal attacks are of course not in order, but so far I have not heard one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is not altogether designed to overcome the practical difficulty, which I fully recognise. If the day comes when the administrative machine gets itself into a situation when it can genuinely say, "We can give priority to the marrying of an acreage survey with rateable valuations", I would find it a very useful survey to be able to look at, but I do not believe that this can possibly be a matter which should engage the attention of the administrative machine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should resist the Amendment, although I have no very great objection to the obtaining of this information. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) said, it would no doubt be a useful exercise in due course—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another supporter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but it would be totally pointless and irrelevant to ask the Board to get down immediately to the whole business of trying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not said at all in the Amendment, and has not been said by any Member. There is no suggestion of immediacy and priority in the Amendment. No speaker has mentioned the question of the measure of priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, but if the Amendment were made to the Bill the Board would feel bound to get cracking on this matter quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an incredible suggestion. We are faced with many huge problems in the Highlands. There are problems about trying to get them developed and about agriculture and transport. Is it seriously suggested that the compilation of this famous list is of sufficient importance to write provision for it in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I heard my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West speak I thought that it would not be too difficult to provide this list. I thought that the information available in the county council and county assessors' offices, among local valuers, and so on, would make this certainly a tedious task but by no
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
means an impossible task, but after my hon. Friend clarified the difficulties which would face the people making up this list it seemed to me that the Amendment would involve something very much greater altogether. We would have an army of land agents, factors and surveyors tripping all over the Highlands, driving all over the Highlands, into every village, to every town council, county council and district council office and eventually up every farm road and into every corner of the Highlands asking questions, unfolding maps, and consulting past references and piles and piles of documents. No doubt umpteen different coloured pencils would be involved in making up this list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably we must ask how long the compilation of the list would take. It has been said that this matter is not urgent; I certainly agree; but it would take, not days or weeks, but months, and possibly even more than a year, to provide this list. I ask the Committee to consider very carefully what value it would be once it was compiled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be better that this information should be obtained fairly quickly so that when the Board commences its work it does not have to go through this procedure to find out what it wants to know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. If it were possible to do this quickly, I should have no objection. If it could be done in 48 hours, I should be willing to accept this proposal. But it cannot be done. The compilation of this list would take months. By the time that it was produced it would be months out of date. What is the point of this exercise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is the case with every valuation roll? They are always out of date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but it would be to the advantage of the Committee if the hon. Gentleman listened to the tenor of my remarks. The hon. Gentleman says that this list would be no more out of date than similar lists, but out of date it would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the first to agree that the Board must have up to date and excellent information so that it may do its job. It must know the facts. It must have information on every conceivable subject, including who owns what piece of land
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
anywhere in the Highlands. If the Amendment were the only way by which the Board could obtain that information, I should not oppose it, but it is not the only way. It is totally unnecessary. The Board already has access to sufficient information about any area of the Highlands. It can find out in a matter of hours, if not minutes, who owns any piece of land which it wishes to develop or in which it is interested. It is no good pretending that it is difficult to find out who owns a piece of river, a hill, a farm or whatever it may be. There is absolutely not difficulty whatsoever. It is merely a question of knowing who to get in touch with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that it is necessary to know precisely how many acres are owned by a landowner who owns, as the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) suggested, hundreds of thousands of acres. Of what conceivable use would it be to me, to any hon. Member or to the Board to know precisely how many acres a particular person owned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I must finish what I am saying. I have been very generous in giving way to hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question about whether Mr. X owns 408,000 or 409,000, or 20 or 21 acres is totally irrelevant to the Board's task. The Board will be engaged in developing the Highlands and it will wish to know who owns a particular piece of land, but, as I have said, there is absolutely no difficulty in finding out who owns any piece of ground in the High lands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the convenience of the Committee, would the hon. Gentleman quote the part of the Bill which gives the power which is suggested in the Amendment? He said that it exists in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand what the hon. Gentleman means. There is no point in my reading out Clause 11 because every hon. Member has it in front of him. We all know what is in
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
the Bill and we know from the Notice Paper what hon. Members opposite wish to put into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the powers which we seek are contained in the Bill. Would he read that part of the Bill which contains the powers which we are seeking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman mean that I have suggested that the power which he is seeking in the Amendment to make up this list is already contained in the Bill? If I have suggested that, then I apologise. They are certainly not contained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. As long as the hon. Gentleman does not know what he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should get on with my argument instead of perpetually dealing with interruptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information which is requested is already available. Therefore, the Amendment would involve a total waste of money and time. We would spend a lot of money and get no positive result. Suppose that we were to agree that this is a good idea, and would be worth all the time and money spent on it. What is the point of limiting it to 500 acres? In any project which the Board may want to put into effect, there is, I do not say the remotest chance, but only a very small chance that the ground which it wishes to obtain for the purpose will be owned by one person. In the vast majority of cases it will be owned by several people. In almost every case there will be people concerned with that ground who own very much less than 500 acres. If we are to accept this Amendment—and I do not think we should—what is the point of limiting it to 500 acres? There is no point in doing that. This is another reason why the Amendment is pointless. It is proposed that we should spend umpteen hundreds or thousands of pounds on compiling this famous list which would take many vital months and would cover only a proportion of the land with which the Board would wish to concern itself. The list would be out of date before it was published. As we have already at our fingertips more than twice the information which the list could give, let us spend

	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
no more time on this Amendment, however well intentioned it may be. Let us get on with the rest of the Bill and acknowledge that the Amendment would gain nothing, but would waste a lot of our time and a lot of the Board's time, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) on one point. It is not always easy to find the owner of land. I understand that frequently the Scottish Departments are unable to find the names of landowners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general proposition, I should not agree that the information would be pointless and irrelevant. Irrespective of the Highland Development Board it would serve a useful sociological purpose if we had some idea of the pattern of ownership in the Highlands and in the rest of Scotland. I should like to know the pattern of ownership of land in Perth and Kinross, and in a large number of other areas. There would be a useful purpose served by having such information, and I think that this was the conclusion arrived at in the articles which appeared in the 	<i>Scotsman</i> about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with whether or not the Board is the appropriate body to obtain this information. I disagree with my hon. Friends about this. I do not think the Board is the appropriate body. If there is a good case for carrying out a survey of this kind, in certain areas or for the whole of the country, I suggest that it should be done in the form of an official survey carried out by the Government. Make no mistake about it, this is a difficult matter and could not be done quickly. It would require the services of a large number of highly skilled professional people and it would cost a fair amount of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would accept the proposition that it should be done by the Board if we could produce arguments about why it should be. With respect, I have not heard any such arguments advanced this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) will, if he reads his speech in the OFFICIAL REPORT, find that he did not produce an argument about why it is a sound proposition for the Board to carry out this job because
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
it would be necessary for that to be done in connection with the work of the Board. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) tried to indicate that there is a case for the Board requiring the information so that it might get on with its work quickly. He is the only hon. Member who has produced an argument linking this with the Board and trying to show why it is necessary that the Board should have this information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are setting up this Board to do a job of work in the Highlands which, as has been generally agreed, is an important one and should be proceeded with as quickly as possible. If it became necessary for the Board to obtain the information of this kind it would have power under the provisions in the Bill to obtain it. That has to be understood. If the Board and the Secretary of State considered that, in order to enable the Board to carry out its remit under Clauses 1 and 3, it was necesary to undertake this survey, it could be done under the terms of the Bill as at present drafted. There is nothing, therefore, to stop the Board from doing it if it is necessary. There is no need for any Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what has been said by my hon. Friend. Would he agree that this is not an exercise which is beyond the resources of the Board if it were found expedient for the Board to do the job? Will he agree that people could be found and that there is experience of a highly skilled nature which would be available to the Board should it decide, either under direction or voluntarily, to do this work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with my hon. Friend. I understand that in some professional categories there is a shortage of the type of people who would be concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are powers in the Bill which would enable the Board to do the work itself or through certain agencies, if it were necessary, and there is no need for an Amendment in that connection. The only purpose which could be served by any Amendment would be in the event of it not being necessary for the execution of its functions that the Board do the work. In that case, I suggest, it is more appropriate that the Government should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
tackle the job because it does not .fit in to the terms of reference of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) referred to the agricultural returns. They relate only to agriculture land, and in the main the agriculture land in the Highlands represents only a fraction of the total, and, therefore, one could not obtain a picture of the ownership on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was careful to say in 95 cases out of every 100 this would happen. Is the Minister able to say whether there are many holdings in the crofting counties on which there is no stock whatever and therefore they are not subject to the 4th June returns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that fairly large acreages are not covered by the return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very small percentage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At any rate, the acreage is fairly large. Everyone has a rough idea about ownership, but the point is that we have never had an accurate survey. The 1873 survey was not accurate. There was a case quoted in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of a property which appeared in the 1873 survey as comprising 25,000 acres. Already 27,000 acres have been sold from that property and there is still a considerable amount left! This indicates the degree of accuracy of the 1873 survey. As has been pointed out this morning, it is difficult to define and particularise the acreages—and that is where the work would be involved—apart from finding the actual owners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the powers are contained in the Bill. Is he aware that the procedure in a case such as we are presenting requires a Motion for an unopposed Return which must have the consent of the Chancellor before it appears on the Order Paper? Has the Board power to proceed in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I do not follow my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the Board has power to obtain the information if that were necessary in connection with the work of the Board and that is what has
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
to be remembered. It could carry out a survey of this kind and use the necessary agencies for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the Crofters Commission Register was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles. I do not think that is exactly parallel. The Crofters Commission is given a large number of functions dealing with individual crofts, and it is necessary, therefore, that there should be a register so that it can carry out this work. I have no doubt that the Commission's Register would be useful to the Board as a source of information, but the kind of work which the Commission is doing is different from that which we visualise will be done by the Board. The job of compiling a register of crofts is more simple than the task we envisage of trying to compile this other register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the points which have been raised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with the point which I made about the powers in respect of a case where the Highland Development Board may wish to develop an area where the owner cannot be found? What are the powers of compulsory acquisition in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend. This is an important point. As I understand it, there are certain sources of information about ownership of land. They exist in the valuation rolls, and in an extreme case it may be possible to trace information in the Register of Sasines. I can assure my hon. Friend that the power of entry of the Board does not require the service of notice on an absentee or untraceable owner, but only on an occupier. A lack of information about ownership would not preclude the acquisition of land or rights over land. Clause 4 applies for this purpose the procedure under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947. In paragraph 19(4) of the First Schedule, to that Act there is a procedure for dealing with the case where it is not practicable, even after inquiry, to ascertain the name and address of an owner. The Land Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1845, takes over to enable this procedure to be carried right through to the stage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
of taking a compulsory title in the absence of an owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The identification of owners is not a very simple matter, for the reasons which I have given, and I do not think it is appropriate for the Board to do it unless it is necessary in connection with the work of the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would make this point in conclusion. In no other part of the Bill have we placed specific duties on the Board in relation to specific tasks. We have taken the view that the Board would be given a wide general remit of the kind of things which have to be done for the promotion of the best interests of the Highlands. We have given the Board powers to do this, and I think it would be wrong to select something which ought to be done and mention it specifically in the Bill. I think the Committee would be wise to avoid writing specific directions to the Board into the Bill. We have managed to avoid that up to the present and I do not think we should do it in connection with this. The same applies to the point about pilot surveys. In the light of the explanation I have given I hope that these Amendments will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister of State said at the beginning of his remarks that my hon. Friend the member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) was the only one who had given a definite reason for the Amendment. My hon. Friend might care to read the words which I uttered when moving the Amendment, when I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… but we know as a fact that it is very difficult, and almost impossible, in many cases to find out who the owner of land in the Highlands may be at the present time. We felt it essential that after the word 'Board' the words in our Amendment should be inserted".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 12th May, 1965; c. 696.]</p></blockquote>
That is the main reason. We want to find out who are the owners of the land, because that is essential for the proper operation of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A variety of contradictory reasons why the Amendment should not be accepted has been given by hon. Gentleman opposite. Some of them have said that it is easy enough to find out who are the
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
owners. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister agrees that it is not as easy as they imagine. It may be helpful if I give some current instances. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister of State that we should have liked to extend this to cover many other areas, including Perthshire, but I appreciate that if my remarks range too wide I shall be ruled out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I hope that I shall be allowed, Mr. Steele, to cite some current examples, by mentioning Glasgow of how difficult it is to find out who are the owners of land. Special powers had to be sought by Glasgow Corporation to enable it to proceed with the acquisition of land for housing and development purposes. It was found that ownership had changed so often over the years that the addresses of the present owners were not known and, because of this, the development of land and house building in the city was being held up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman say how many of the owners who could not be found owned acreages of more than 500, the amount to which the Amendment applies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that. I intend to quote from a letter which I received from a former Tory Chancellor. Perhaps if hon. Gentlemen opposite hold their tongues for a while they will allow me to reach that point. They will get their answer, not from me but from a former Tory Chancellor. As I say, special powers had to be granted by the Government—it was a Tory Government at the time—to enable Glasgow Corporation to proceed with the development of land and the building of houses in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the point about procedure, because while the Minister said that the Board already has these powers, I have been assured by the former Chancellor to whom I referred that in proceeding in this matter a Motion is required. I sent a Motion to the Chancellor for an unopposed Return, but since that needed his consent before it could appear on the Order Paper and since he refused to give that consent on 17th May, 1963, that was that. That being so, how can my hon. Friend say that the Board could proceed, remembering that it is an extra-Parliamentary body, by a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
method which is denied to hon. Members? Like my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles, I do not wish to extend the debate on the Amendment unnecessarily, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves this point and since, probably through ignorance, I do not know what this business of a Motion relating to an unopposed Return is all about, would he explain it to us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. All we are interested in at the moment is what lies within the Money Resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since it may seem a rather odd term, and if we are not to be allowed to know what this phrase in the Parliamentary glossary is all about, would it not be helpful if my hon. Friend were to explain what he means by an unopposed Return in this Respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we have enough difficulty explaining what is already in the Bill, without explaining what is not in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am simply quoting from a letter which I received on 17th May, 1963, from the then Tory Chancellor. It is evidently not my business to explain these matters to the Committee and I suppose that the obvious way to understand them is to contact the former Chancellor by question. The appearance of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"all lands over 500 acres in extent"</p></blockquote>
in the Amendment has been the subject of much criticism, but I assure hon. Gentlemen opposite that there is a good reason for the figure of 500 appearing there. The reason derives from the letter to which I am referring. In it I was told by this former Tory Chancellor, who had the power to govern the procedure on this matter in Parliament:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have examined the possibility of such a Return being made, and I have looked at the 1874 Return made by the Inland Revenue. I find that while it would be practicable to prepare such a Return, the work involved would be very considerable indeed, and would require the employment of large numbers of additional staff. I regret, therefore, that I cannot justify the expenditure of public money upon such a Return, and I am writing to say that the Chancellor cannot, therefore, give his consent."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
My request on that occasion for that return went right down to one acre, in strict keeping with the 1874 Return. Having been told by the then Chancellor that it was not possible, because of the number of people who would have to be employed to make such a return, and loving Chancellors of the Exchequer as I do—and not wishing to cause unnecessary work—we generously—I say "We" because this was done in collaboration with my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles—decided to exempt everyone owning between one and 500 acres and we made 500 the bottom limit. We thought that by doing that we would get a very large bag of fish indeed, sufficiently large to justify the return we were proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman say what he wants his fish for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To fry them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I wanted to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—or to gut them to get out of them what ought not to belong to them.—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Of course it should not. If I am to be lured along these lines I am perfectly prepared to embark on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Member is rising to a bait which is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At any convenient time I will be pleased to take that bait and not only swallow it but take the hook, line and sinker as well, because there is no defence for private landlordism in Britain today. However, in the sort of scattered, spineless criticism which has come from hon. Gentlemen opposite I have been surprised that the landlords have had so little to say in defence of landlordism. I can see one or two landlords on the benches opposite, but their voices have not been raised against the Amendment. A landlord intervenes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would prefer six hours. I am surprised the noble Lord wants to limit such a debate to five hours. By all means let us debate land owner-ship—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help, Mr. Steele, if hon. Gentlemen opposite were ruled out of order before they put their questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot rule on anything till I hear what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You know what they are going to say! However, I am anxious to conclude my remarks on the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And about time, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has seemed to me, from the interventions, that hon. Gentleman opposite like me so much that they do not want me to resume my seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had no real criticism of the Amendment from hon. Gentlemen opposite, and a modicum of support from my hon. Friend the Minister of State, who almost encouraged us by saying, in effect, "It does not go far enough". I assure my hon. Friend that if I had the power I would bring in the whole of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A feature of this little debate has been the small amount of serious opposition to the Amendment from hon. Gentlemen opposite. It is rather significant and partly a reflection of the things that have been happening politically in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman proceeds, and since I know that he does not want to be unfair, he should remember that we on this side of the Committee have recognised the Amendment for what it is. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) said that he had been trying to do this for years in various ways. We know exactly what it is. We have heard all these arguments 	<i>ad nauseam</i> on Bill after Bill. They are irrelevant, in our view, on this Clause, and that is why we did not want to waste the time of the Committee by producing many arguments about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that irrevelancy is a matter for the Chair.
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
If the right hon. Gentleman wishes to make remarks of that sort he should address his rebuke directly to the Chair, and not me. The Amendment is obviously in order and it has had the support of a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. If the right hon. Gentleman wished to intervene he should have done so in order to state his views about the matter and not merely talk about irrelevancy. I do not know why he should feel so nauseated about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is curious to note how little opposition there has been anywhere to the Amendment. Particularly, it is noteworthy that nobody has objected in regard to any principle involved, as they used to do. There has been absolutely no expression of opposition to it from the Landlords' Federation, from individual landlords or others outside the Committee who are interested in this matter. I suggest that had there been anything nauseating in this, even to the landlords outside the Committee—in the Highlands in particular—we would soon have heard from them. It was, therefore, odd to hear the right hon. Gentleman's expression of nausea regarding the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my remarks at our sittings yesterday I did not say anything which was not strictly related to the Amendment and I regret to have been obliged, by the intervention of the right hon. Gentleman, to be led astray somewhat today. Suffice to say that the directly interested parties—the landlords—outside have not protested. Having strayed from the purpose of the Amendment, might I just mention the unopposed Return referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin)? Hon. Gentlemen opposite certainly opposed the demand for such a Return today and, therefore, I assume that they are against the making of such a Return. However, I do not believe that they are against it on any grounds other than what they may regard as its irrelevancy and that to carry it out would create a lot of work. All the same, I imagine that in their minds they are thinking of the phrase used by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) "exposure of landlords".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used the word "exposure". When he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
reads tomorrow the OFFICIAL REPORT he will see whether or not he did. I did not think that Tories ever admitted that landlords had anything to conceal. Indeed, from the remarks of some hon. Gentlemen opposite it would seem that all landlords are the most innocent and righteous of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not the purpose of the exercise. We are concerned with equipping the Board with sufficient powers to perform its tasks. We have not suggested that the Board should perform the task stated in the Amendment as one of its first and immediate duties. The argument about priorities was introduced by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), but it has nothing to do with the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan said, this information should, indeed, be available for the whole of Scotland. There is a precedent since it was made available for the whole of Scotland in the eighteen-seventies. If they could cope with a survey of this kind in 1870, are we not able to cope with it today, with all the new resources, from trained personnel to computer equipment, now available? If in those days of the 'Seventies the Tories thought it was worth doing, why on earth are the Tories opposing it now? I am talking about both the merits and the mechanics of compiling the list. Why on earth do the Tories today think that it is either irrelevant or impossible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State has gone a long way towards satisfying us by saying that the Board has full powers to undertake a task of this kind. There is also the device of direction by the Secretary of State in the last resort. He can ask the Board to do it, in which case I imagine that the Secretary of State would ensure that the Board was financially and otherwise specially equipped to do the job. By expressing this view, my hon. Friend goes a good way towards satisfying me and my hon. Friend. Merely to say, however, as my hon. Friend did, that it would be an interesting sociological exercise is rather cutting it down to size, if not to well below size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Return was considered to be necessary and acceptable in the eighteen-seventies when they were not terribly in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
terested in sociological exercises, especially in the Highlands, it has become even more necessary now with so much new development and so many new authorities being brought into action. We already have a considerable amount of information. To a large extent, this exercise will be a matter of extension and collation, bringing up to date, and keeping up to date. Keeping up to date is an exercise in itself which has to be faced in every field, from defence to the local valuation roll. This does not mean that we can avoid responsibility in any of these fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not suggest that hon. Members opposite should necessarily support us to a vote, I ask them to recognise that the landlords were prepared to do this in the eighteen-seventies. Among them, those who represented landed interests in the House of Commons, as they always do, must have agreed to give instructions to have the lands return prepared in those days. The arguments which held good then are far stronger today; and, as I have said, it would be much easier to do it now. I cannot understand the Tories' opposition to this, unless that they have become even more reactionary than they ever were in past centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Board should have as much information as possible about the territory in which Parliament is instructing it to operate. We have come across so many bizarre situations about land, land values, and compensation for actual or so-called encroachment on land. When the Hydro-Electric Board goes into an area to survey, it is dealing with subjects with very low valuations, indeed, and is told by the County Assessors that most of the land is merely sporting and bog land. The moment there is any public development by the Hydro Board or anyone else, every acre of the same bog land rises in value to thousands of pounds and the taxpayers and the ratepayers are mulcted accordingly. If the Highland Tories and landlords are not ashamed of that, they jolly well ought to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
the convenience of the Committee if we take with this Amendment, Amendments No. 122 and No. 123.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 7, line 28, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Such an owner occupier or person who considers that the information specified in a notice served under subsection (1) of this section cannot be justified as being reasonably required by the Board in the exercise of its functions, may appeal within one month of the service of such notice to the sheriff of the county within which is situated his land business or undertaking: and the sheriff shall give judgment on such appeal within two months of the receipt thereof.</p></blockquote>
The Clause, because it confers extremely wide powers, will probably exercise quite a lot of the Committee's attention over the next few hours. I have studied the remarks made by the Secretary of State about the Clause on Second Reading. I want to draw the Committee's attention to them, because they give an indication of the way in which and the degree in which the Government proposed these powers be emloyed. The Secretary of State said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is no question of giving the Board a general power of inquisition. The Clause relates only to information which the Board may reasonably require for the execution of any of its functions. I have no doubt that the Board will normally get the information it requires without difficulty. But it is possible, for example, that the preparation of a comprehensive scheme of development by the Board might be seriously delayed, if not jeopardised, by the refusal of an individual to provide vital information."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th March, 1965; Vol. 708, c. 1094.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it seems that the whole purpose of the Clause is to ensure that, where comprehensive development is proposed, it will not be hampered or delayed by the refusal by certain individuals to provide necessary information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vital words in the Clause are probably:
	<br><blockquote><p>"information … as the Board may reasonably require for the execution of any of their functions".</p></blockquote>
Here we are falling back on to the words "reasonably require". Again and again the Minister of State has said that the Board will be composed of reasonable people who will take reasonable decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that there will be some oppor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
tunity for appeal against what may be judged by the Board or by the Government to be reasonable. It is important to safeguard people by giving them the right of appeal. The Amendment has one small grammatical error in it. There should be a comma in it between "owner" and "occupier". The Amendment should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such an owner, occupier or person …"</p></blockquote>
The Amendment seeks to make the appeal to the sheriff of the county within which is situated the land or business or undertaking. I am not in any way thirled to that suggestion. It is merely a suggestion of a type of appeal which could be undertaken. Equally, the whole process of appeal, according to the Amendment, would last only three months. Under subsection (2), the Government state three months as the period after which they will start to take action to demand this information. Therefore, there is no further delay in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to develop my argument by example, because the simple argument is clearly understood. I would be interested to hear from the Minister of State the type of information which he considers may be required in certain circumstances. The Government argue that this information will be necessary if comprehensive development is not to be delayed. This is the kind of argument to which I am sympathetic. None the less, I believe that where there are such wide powers of investigation, as at least technically the Clause would bring into existence, there must be safeguards for the individual. He must be allowed to make a case as to whether such a demand is or is not reasonable by reference to another person or body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency a few people have approached me about this matter. On each occasion when I was approached the point which was made was a fair one. These were people with relatively small commercial enterprises, business enterprises. The businesses depended for their success or failure upon the business acumen of the individual, which in turn depended on secrecy, upon his knowing his business and others not knowing his business. This is essentially part of the working of private businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an earlier Amendment I quoted the example of Perrins in Lewis. If the Board ever took over a business of that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
kind, there is the possibility that, under the strict terms of the Bill, the Board would have the ability to investigate the accounts and business returns of a competitive firm and thus put itself into a stronger position. I admit that this is a hypothetical case, but the Minister of State will understand the genuine fears people have, which should be allayed. I also quoted the example of MacBrayne's, which caused consternation in some quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is reasonable. I am not necessarily pressing this particular form of appeal, but the Minister of State should consider the possibility of providing some mechanism of appeal. This mechanism of appeal would not result in any further delay than that which is already provided for in subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this is a very bad Clause, and if it has to go through I would support an Amendment along the lines of this one. I wonder whether the Minister has thought about this. What is the position of a business which is carrying on some secret process? Does it have to divulge information? Has the Minister thought of this point—would a company, for example a foreign one or even an English company, bringing money, perhaps employment, to the Highlands, be likely to set up in that area if it knew that the Board could act as a sort of inquisitor in all its affairs? It is very doubtful. I would suggest that we are giving powers to this Board probably exceeding those which the Russian Government or the Chinese Government have. Lastly, who interprets the word "reasonably" in subsection (1)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison), the Board could not demand all sorts of information from every firm, unless it could show that it required it for the conduct of its business. The hon. Gentleman asked who determined this. In the final resort, the courts decide this. This is what the Clause means as it stands. If a person does not provide the information, he is taken to court. Then the court decides whether what is asked for is reasonable. This is a good safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt for a moment to clear my mind, and, I hope,
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
the Committee's? This is, I think, not the point, because all the court would be judging would be whether the information was "reasonably required" by the Board for the execution of its functions. Suppose the Board set up a factory to make Drambuie. It would be perfectly "reasonable" for the Board to require from the people who make Drambuie the necessary means for making it, and the court would have no option but to say this was "reasonably required" for the purpose of the Board's functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board would have to show that for the purpose of its functions it was necessary to set up a factory to produce Drambuie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think the hon. Gentleman is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman and I can differ about this. This is a matter for the courts to decide. I cannot imagine that the courts would tolerate for one moment the abuse by the Board of the powers given under the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the matter, although I am no more a legal expert than is the Minister of State, if the Board exercises its statutory powers under Clause 6 to set up and run a business, and if that is a business of a specialist sort, and if the Board then goes to a firm running a business of the same sort and demands information, I can see no reason in Clause 11 for the court to object. The Board can say that it "reasonably requires" the information for the conduct of the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. If we pursue this point, Mr. Steele, we seem to be discussing the Clause as a whole. I am quite prepared to discuss the wider objects of the Clause, but I doubt whether you would permit that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was listening, and taking advice on the matter. It seemed to me that the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) was giving advance notice of a very technical matter which might enable the Minister himself to be armed with information when the Committee reaches the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. That may be the best method of dealing with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. That was roughly my intention, but I was afraid that the Minister was perhaps, unintentionally, misleading the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) in saying that the points the hon. Member and my hon. Friend mentioned could not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I said that. I was pointing out who would determine what was reasonable. I said the courts would do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When this matter was under discussion by the Parliamentary Bills Committee at the end of March, the Committee made a report in which Lord Cameron said that no precedent was being created by the Bill in the matter of the Board's powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Steele, I am in a difficulty about whether to wait till the Committee reaches the Question on the Clause, but in view of what you said, I will confine my remarks to the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) an individual would have to make one of three choices. He could give the information. He could decide not to give the information and after three months be charged with not giving it. On this alternative, the Clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any person on whom a notice has been served under the foregoing subsection fails without reasonable cause or neglects to furnish to the Board within three months after the service of the notice the information specified in the notice … he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.</p></blockquote>
The third alternative would be that which was suggested by the hon. Member for Inverness. The person concerned could say, "I shall not give this information but I shall use my right of appeal." He would have a month in which to make the appeal and the sheriff has two months to decide whether or not to grant the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an open mind on this matter. I can see the merits of the course suggested by the hon. Member for Inverness and there seems to be something in it. If we leave the Clause as it is, the person concerned has to place himself in a position
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
of becoming a criminal. If the Amendment is accepted, he can go to the Court and say he will appeal, in which case he avoids the stigma of criminality. I would like to have rather longer to think about the Amendment. If we decided to accept it, it would have to be reworded. Amendments would probably have to be made to the Clause considerably longer than the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Individuals are given three months in which to submit the information which is required and they can presumably decide to give the information in the last week of that period. If a person desires to appeal, that means a period of a month is allowed and there will then be two months for the sheriff to take his decision, if the Amendment were accepted. Should the Board then have to start all over again to serve a fresh notice after the sheriff's decision? This point should be borne in mind, because if that were to be the case, it could involve delays of anything up to a total of six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point. My understanding of the position is that that would not be so. The Board would not have to start again. It would simply confirm the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased with the reception the Minister gave to my Amendment, and in view of his assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We consider this Clause to be important and its importance goes much wider than the Bill. So far as I know, nothing in legislation exists which goes as wide as this Clause in giving powers to the Government, through the agency of the Board, to seek information. I can say, on behalf of my hon. and right hon. Friends on this side of the Commttee, that we strongly oppose the Clause as it is at present drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason for the very wide nature of the Clause is the extent of the information which comes within its ambit.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
It seems that it covers virtually any subject. From the wording of the Clause there would seem hardly any activity carried on by a person or a body in the Highlands about which information could not be obtained. I should be glad if the Minister would correct our impression if it is inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland mentioned, during the Second Reading debate, other Acts and Bills which he said contained similar powers to obtain information. I have looked at them and do not think that that is so. For example, the Secretary of State referred to the Industrial Training Act, 1964. He must have been referring to Section 6, but the information which can be sought there is restricted to obtaining from employers information concerning certain particulars of employment of persons working for them. Other Measures to which he referred were the Small Landholders and Agricultural Holdings Act, 1931, and the Harbours Act, 1964, but the information which can be sought under their appropriate Sections is restricted to particular matters which fall within the scope of the Acts in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point on the financial side. Because the Clause covers information on virtually any subject it is clear that the accounts of a business can be inquired into, and, secondly, that information can be sought which it may be expensive for a person or firm to discover and to produce. There appears to be no provision for compensating them although they might be put to considerable expense in providing the information requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that the safeguards written into the Bill are adequate to safeguard information of a highly confidential nature belonging to a firm operating in a highly competitive field. If the Clause were passed in its present form it would be a major inroad of powers which Parliament gives to Government. If the Clause were passed in this form it would be regarded as a precedent. Hon. Members would say in future, "Parliament has approved of the Government being able to obtain this information through the agency of a Board." For this and the other reasons I have given, we consider that the powers are much too wide and that they are not necessary for the purpose of the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
We therefore strongly oppose the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take a contrary view to that expressed by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). I strongly support the Clause and I welcome the fact that its powers are wide. I hope that its powers will be utilised as widely as the Bill allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause deals specifically with land. Many of the troubles in the Highlands are due to the fact that the land is being misused. Another problem is depopulation, which the Bill is supposed to stop. We have created agencies, such as the Forestry Commission, to deal with the land problem. It is now recognised that the Forestry Commission does not have adequate powers. It has no power to acquire land compulsorily. It can only take the land offered to it by the landlords. Nobody can dispute that fact. It should have greater power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we have the contrast in the Highlands that, while the landlord has complete security in his ownership and possession of land—and even the Commission cannot interfere with him—the man who works the: land and grows the crops has no security of tenure. Under the 1957 Act, the tenancy cannot pass to his son. Therefore, the development of land in the Highlands does not proceed in the way that it should. The son, knowing that he will not necessarily succeed to his father's tenancy, makes no effort to continue development, since he is aware that within two years he may be flung out of his farm without any appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seemed to be suggesting that by the 1957 Act it was made impossible for the son to succeed the father.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rubric must have some relation to the contents of the Clause, which gives very wide powers. I believe that land is the basic problem in the Highlands. The problem of its ownership goes with it. There is a conflict between the people who possess the land and the people who work it. There are hon. Members opposite who say that the land should remain in the possession of the private landlord, although their view was modified considerably during discussion of the Amendment which I moved. There are others
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
who say that the land should belong to the farmer who works it. But in the Highlands there is a growing body of opinion among people who think that it should belong to neither the landlord nor the farmer, but to the nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to follow the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). They seemed to me to have little to do with the Clause, which deals with the obtaining of information. If we leave the Clause in the Bill, we shall go a long way to defeating the whole purpose of the Bill. If I understand the Bill's purpose aright, it is to encourage development in the Highlands. I can think of few Clauses more calculated than this one to have precisely the opposite effect. Any company or business contemplating setting up in the Highlands will look at this Clause and think again. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) pointed out when we were discussing the Amendment of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston), there is no limit to the business secrets which a firm might be reasonably considered to require to pass on to the Board under the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) referred to the position which might arise if the Board "reasonably" decided that it wished to manufacture Drambuie, and could "reasonably" demand information. The Minister shakes his head, but the fact is that under Clause 6 it might be held by the courts not to be unreasonable for the Board to decide to manufacture Drambuie and, for that purpose, to require existing manufacturers in the Highlands to deliver information to the Board about their secret processes. I cannot imagine any greater deterrent to industry setting up in the Highlands, particularly when, fortunately, there are plenty of other areas where new industry could be established, and where such an extremely wide-ranging power would not be available as a deterrent to incoming industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman look at the other side of the question? We have been waiting a long time for development in many parts of the Highlands. Suppose that the Board has inquiries from a private developer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
who wants land in a certain area, and the Board, because it wants development, wants to acquire land, and the land is not available because the landlord says that he is not prepared to allow that land to be developed. Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the Board, in order to accommodate the private developer who wants to set up perhaps a small factory, or something of that kind, and to take up the slack and to retain population and provide employment, should have power under the Clause to secure land and information about its use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Board may need certain very limited and restricted powers to acquire information, but that is not what the Clause is about. It gives the Board 	<i>carte blanche</i> to call for any information which, having regard to Clause 6, may be considered reasonable. I suggest that the courts might take a very wide ranging view of what "reasonable" in terms of this Clause and Clause 6 mean. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) referred to the question of acquiring land. This Clause goes very much further than that. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person carrying on a business or undertaking"</p></blockquote>
in the area of the Highland counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most concerned with the question of obtaining information about business operations in the Highlands. The Clause would discourage firms from going to the Highlands. It would also discourage existing firms in the Highlands from developing their activities. Indeed, it might encourage them to go elsewhere. I hope very much that we shall take the Clause out of the Bill, or will, at any rate, redraft it so as to restrict very severely the Board's powers to acquiring information which is genuinely needed for its operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important Clause, and I feel that it would be very wrong for us to pass it in its present form. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) paid me what he thought was a compliment but which I did not accept as a compliment when he said that I was one of the few people on this side who is not a substantial landowner. I hope that he will check his facts a little more carefully. I am a landowner. The land which I have attached to my house is
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
more than adequate for taking care of the dogmatic, inflexible Socialism which we have from hon. Members opposite. I do not feel that the Bill, or any other Bill like it, is appropriate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman sure that he is a landlowner? Does he own the feu?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of feu is a quite separate matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which I might have the opportunity of saying something about at a later stage.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Board is to be a success there is certain information which it can reasonably expect to have from a business or undertaking working in the Highlands. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must keep the hon. Gentleman in order. I did not use the word "primarily".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would remind hon. Members that it is the Chairman's job to try to keep order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at tomorrow's Report of our proceedings he will find that in the first two sentences of his speech he said—or he gave me the impression: perhaps I was not listening as carefulily as I should—that the Clause was concerned essentially with land ownership. That is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>743</span>
impression which I gained. If I am incorrect I certainly apologise, but on the basis of what the hon. Gentleman said later it would appear that he was concerned primarily with the question of ownership and the development of land. As I see it, this Clause is concerned primarily with the question of business undertakings. If the Board is to do the job which was described during the Second Reading debate and the previous debates in Committee on the Amendments it will not be concerned with land as such or the ownership of land but with the techniques of business, the prosion of employment and so on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and if it is not concerned with that I think we have been given a misleading impression. All business must be conducted on the land and that we accept. I think that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) was hoping to intervene, but I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about fishing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely information which the Board would want and could use properly would relate to how a business was operated, its profitability and prospects. If the Board is to plan industrial development and to encourage new industries and new techniques it might want to know the extent to which an enterprise could provide employment and what kind of jobs would be available in the future. It might also want to know the financial position of a company and whether it was likely to continue in being in future years. I do not think that would be unreasonable information for the Board to acquire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite certain where the tenor of the argument being advanced by my hon. Friend leads. I can quite see that if the Board were in a position directly or through the Board of Trade to finance a firm then naturally it would want this sort of information, but is my hon. Friend saying that, as a matter of course, the Board should go to all the firms in the Highlands and ask them for their accounts to see whether they were likely to fold up or not? I think that might cause some trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee find difficulty at the beginning of my speeches in appreciating where they will lead. I can only suggest to my right hon. Friend that if he is prepared to wait this may become apparent in time, although I can give no guarantee whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to indicate that there is certain information which should be available to the Board if it is to do its job properly, and I think that even the most reactionary hon. Member on this side would accept—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is not reactionary on that side?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there are many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we should allow the debate to continue properly without so many sedentary interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the protection which you are affording to me, Mr. Steele. I think it is well merited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think everyone would accept that the Board should have some information. We have to think of the rights of industry and I feel that over the last few years every new Act of Parliament has given some new power to the Government. It has infringed the rights of the individual and private enterprise in business and commerce. Regarded individually it would not appear that there is much involved by these Acts, but when they are put together we can see that there has been a fundamental change, and this argument may be related directly to the Clause under discussion. There has been a fundamental change in which more power has been given to the central Government and less power left with the individual. This Clause represents a further step in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should think of it not only in terms of the content of the Clause, but what has gone before and what may happen in the future. This is just one of a series of things which are taking place which result in more responsibility and more work for private industry. Perhaps I may be permitted to make a passing reference to what I think was the first
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
step in that direction. It indicates the kind of problem which business in the Highlands will have to face. The first step relates to P.A.Y.E. Every hon. Member will appreciate that a great deal of work was put on private industry by the need to deal with P.A.Y.E. There are many similar instances by which individual industries in the Highlands and elsewhere are called on to devote the time of members of the staff, and are put to expense, in providing information and services for the benefit of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board could go to private industry and say that it required certain information which must be provided. The only safeguard which I can see is contained in the one word "reasonable" which appears in the Clause, but we have no indication of what is meant by "reasonable". It might be reasonable to expect a business to provide information in the sense that it has the staff and facilities to do so. But is it justifiable to say that a business must become involved in some comprehensive plan to gather informaion which may result in considerable expense when the information could have been secured by the Board? The Board will, I think, be concerned primarily with obtaining information from new or developing companies, and these are the very organisations which will not be able to afford time and money to providing such information. If an entirely new industry is started in a remote part of the country considerable expense may be involved. The nature of the industry may be marginal, and surely it is this kind of factory about which the Board would require a great deal of information. Is it reasonable to expect that kind of undertaking to spend a great deal of time, when the business is being built up, in providing information for the benefit of the Board? I think it would be fair for the Government to provide financial assistance if a considerable amount of information were demanded, and that should be an essential feature of any scheme to enable the Board to obtain information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the difficulty in respect of secrecy. Every business has certain trade secrets. There may be items in the accounts which it would not want anyone else to know about. A real
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
danger exists, even though information may be revealed in complete secrecy. Members of the Board will include people engaged in industry and commerce in the Highlands. This is indicated by the content of one of the Schedules to the Bill where reference is made to contracts being placed, and it states that individuals on the Board with an interest should not participate in the discussion in any way. From this, surely, we may be led to believe that certain members of the Board may be up to their necks in industry and commerce in the Highlands of which they will have a great deal of experience. I do not think that secrets about the financial liability of a company should be revealed to the Board. I am not suggesting that members of the Board would pass this information round to all and sundry. Of course they would not. Perhaps in their own business dealings they might find their attitude affected, when the business was being discussed, and information which they obtained as members of the Board might colour their views. The Government should, I think, tread warily regarding this matter of information which might concern trade secrets or which could be damaging to the prospects of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This I feel is a dangerous Clause. I accept that there may be some information which the Board would require, but if we are to have such a Clause as this included in the Bill I suggest that there should be positive safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of these safeguards should concern the question of expense. This is a vital matter. The Government will have to provide some means whereby information which is expensive to collect may attract some recompense. Secondly, on the question of secrecy, may we have more detail about the kind of information which the Board may reasonably require? Is it the case that individuals who feel that it is not reasonable for the Board to ask for certain information will have to wait till they are taken to court before the case is decided? Cannot there be an earlier stage where the person may establish whether he can refuse to provide information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the attitude of the Opposition to this Clause. I feel that it should be withdrawn, and if it is brought in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
again in another form, there should be included effective safeguards for industry and commerce and particularly new industry in the Highlands, because I am sure that many will be worried about the provisions in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several of my hon. Friends have advanced a very good case indeed for the scrapping of this Clause in its present form, and it seemed to me that they made some useful and constructive suggestions for what might be incorporated in a redrafted Clause. I hope very much that the Minister will take note of what has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay the Committee by repeating points which have already been made, beyond saying that the Clause has proved a useful vehicle for some hon. Members opposite who tend to regard landowners as their favourite Aunt Sallies at which they can throw some of their misguided missiles, and this is particularly true of the more old-fashioned of hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tugboat Annies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) who has a youthful expression, should have dated himself so clearly in this way. So much of what he has to say reveals how out of touch he and some of his hon. Friends are with the affairs of the countryside. At one point I was tempted to ask whether the 1873 review or register was the result of the hon. Member having put down a Question. Some of the things he has said are very misleading. One particular generalisation which struck me was that land in the Highlands is being misused. That is indeed a very broad generalisation. No doubt information will come to light which will show that the hon. Member is rather off beam in this case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But will the hon. Member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to be as quick as possible and so I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman at this moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also wanted information about land ownership, on account of his basic feeling that there is maldistribution of land. Again, of course, he misleads himself.
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
He wants to know how many acres belong to such and such a person. That is the sort of information we have already discussed and it is not directly relevant to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) said something which I must correct. The hon. Gentleman threw his Molotov cocktail into the Committee and then retired, but I am glad to see that he has now returned. He referred to the Duke of Buccleuch. I can assure him that he does not own a single acre in the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main anxiety about this Clause is that, as drafted, it will turn the Highlands into a snoopers' paradise, which is not, I think, the sort of thing regarded as being generally desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, a question raised by some of my hon. Friends is that of the cost of providing some of the information which may be required. It might involve endless researches by solicitors and others into archives to produce the necessary papers. It might require accountants drawing up statistics and figures relating to a great many years and possibly it might involve persons being questioned. A great deal of expense might be incurred. There must be some safeguard by which the individual can get a degree of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have probably said enough. Much as I would like to say a great deal more I am sure that most of it would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord spoke on behalf of his 220,000 acres of property in the Lowlands, and said cogently that they were not in the Highlands. I will not comment on that issue, and, apart from that, most of the points which he made are hardly worth answering. However, there are certain more noteworthy views which representative people in the Highlands, some of whom are landowners, would like to make known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord said that the Bill would create a snooper's paradise. Is he not aware that under much of the legislation which was sponsored by Governments of his own party there is already wide power to seek a great variety of information? It is no good the noble Lord talking about people living in the eighteen-seventies while he himself is wallowing in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
the eighteenth century. His views on this subject, particularly in relation to the ownership of land and the alleged justification for such ownership, are certainly of the eighteenth century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the noble Lord and his hon. Friends to consider the views of the Highlands and Islands Panel and Lord Cameron, its Chairman, and respected judge and a man of great authority on the questions we are discussing. I am sure, if the noble Lord looks further into these matters, that he will see that his opinions regarding the proposed powers of that Board are not worth a cent. I advise him to consider Lord Cameron's views as expressed to newspapermen after a Press interview following the Highlands and Islands Panel's meeting at which the powers of the Board were considered. Inverness County Council also had a meeting to discuss this matter and much of the discussion which took place was reported in the public Press. This is how 	<i>The Scotsman</i> reported after the Inverness County Council meeting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Iain R. Hilleary"—</p></blockquote>
a respected member of the Council, respected by all parties, a fair-minded man, as most hon. Members will agree; I was with him in past years on the Highland Panel—
	<br><blockquote><p>"said the two clauses were looked into thoroughly by the Highland Panel last week and Lord Cameron had advised them that no new powers were proposed. Mr. Hilleary said they should not be unduly alarmed by anything contained in the Bill".</p></blockquote>
The report went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. A. Lindsay, Glenmore, said it was almost impossible for anyone to build a picture of the economic situation within the Highlands without these powers. The Provost of Fort William, the Rev. Canon E. Henderson, said everyone had asked that the Board should have teeth."</p></blockquote>
It went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Cameron, chairman of the organisation, told reporters afterwards that the panel had welcomed the Bill to set up the board and the wide powers proposed for it."</p></blockquote>
	<i>The Scotsman</i> report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the other hand, the panel felt today that the board's powers, if used properly and wisely, could provide a real stimulus to development and an effective means of attracting investment."</p></blockquote>
The following part of the report will probably answer the points raised by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart):
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was the view of the panel, their chairman explained, that the board's main duties would be to stimulate and promote enterprise through the provision of the requisite provisions and services. But Lord Cameron added later: 'The panel appreciate that the new board must respect the local authorities' frontiers and functions. It should seem neither to duplicate nor over-ride them.'"</p></blockquote>
Later in the report it was stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Asked if the panel felt that too much was being expected of the board, he said that the panel were under no illusion as to what the powers and duties of the board would be, or as to what they should be."</p></blockquote>
Those are the views of a body which is probably the most highly representative in the Highlands. It includes landlords, Tories, Liberals, Socialists, people from both sides of industry and individuals appointed by the Secretary of State outside those categories. Also on the Panel are all the conveners and certain other representatives of county councils and other local bodies. The Highland Panel came to the conclusion that the powers envisaged for the Board in the Bill were necessary. The Parliamentary Bills Committee of Inverness County Council, through its most capable spokesmen, came to the same conclusion and gave the opinions as reported in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> and which I have quoted. It would be highly irresponsible of hon. Gentlemen opposite to condemn, perhaps almost with contempt, the view said to be held by such an eminent authority as Lord Cameron and by the Highland Panel and local government that the Board's powers are founded largely on precedent and existing powers in other fields. These opinions, I suggest, would stand up to any test in any debate or in a court of law against the much less informed opinions of hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I immediately admit that one possibly could not discount the views of such distinguished a judge as Lord Cameron. It should be remembered, however, that those views were not expressed unanimously by his colleagues on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quoting Lord Cameron as Chairman of the Highland Panel but directly on the proposed powers. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Highland Panel was unanimous on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman was quoting Lord Cameron as a distinguished jurist in saying that there were precedents to be found. I merely say that there are other opinions on this matter among the judges of the Court of Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that we all agree that these are very wide powers and I am sure that it is right that a Committee of the House of Commons, which has been traditionally the guardian of personal liberty down the ages, should give great care to considering whether or not they should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It all comes down, as has been said, to the interpretation of the word "reasonable". The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"… as the Board may reasonably require for the execution of any of their functions …"</p></blockquote>
mean that those functions could be as wide as to extend to the promotion, assistance or undertaking of measures to implement any proposals specified. It all depends on the word "reasonable" and how one interprets it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem that it might be reasonable for the Board to ask for the costs that lie on a firm's production, for profit and loss accounts or even for processing methods. I only say that it could. It all depends on the interpretation of the word "reasonable". One can think of matters in the courts and the question of getting a reasonable judge. Like Members of Parliament, judges have wide ranges of reasonableness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, dear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It all depends on the word "reasonable". When it comes to the awarding of powers I will make probably my final quotations from a previous debate. This time it concerns the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Scotland. This is probably the only occasion when I have been unable to quote the Minister of State. The reason is that on that occasion that hon. Gentleman was not present in the Committee. It was on the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned at that time with fishing industry legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that occasion we were concerned with what I should have thought was a very much less power than is being sought today, merely the power
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
of the Secretary of State to pay housing subsidies direct to a housing association. The right hon. Gentleman the present Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What the hon. Gentleman"—</p></blockquote>
and that was the Under-Secretary of State at the time—
	<br><blockquote><p>"says here and what the right hon. Gentleman does later are different matters. I remember a long quotation which I used to chalk up about the dangers of trusting the Secretary of State for Scotland with great powers."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1st February, 1962; c. 61.]</p></blockquote>
Later the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) took up the point and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) has said, there are no safeguards in this matter … The assurances that the Under-Secretary is giving us are merely verbal assurances, which may be all right or which may not. The fact is that power is being taken … and … those arrangements might be very special … As my hon. Friends have pointed out … the assurances which we have been given are merely verbal assurances which could be greatly widened. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent this from happening … I am reluctant to give the Secretary of State a blank cheque. We are falling down on our job if we leave him with these powers.—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1st February, 1962; c. 74.]</p></blockquote>
The powers which we are giving to the Board today far outrun those to which, with, I believe, great sincerity, hon. Gentlemen opposite objected on that occasion. I, too, say that we cannot—indeed, we should not—issue what is the blankest of all blank cheques, one of the blankest that Parliament has been asked to issue. Till the Minister can convince the Committee of identical precedents, my hon. Friends and I must hold these views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will begin by answering the points made by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). He said that there might be precedents for giving these powers and he is correct there are precedents for all the powers contained in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that there might be. I said that as far as I knew there were no known powers which covered the whole field of any subject. I asked the Minister to say whether this was correct and whether the points that had been mentioned would come within the powers given in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0740">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To give some examples of precedents, there is the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947, the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1955, more recently the Industrial Training Act, 1964, the Land Draining (Scotland) Act, 1958, the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act, 1961 and the Harbours Act, 1964. I admit that the type of powers given in each of those is different, although they overlap. Each covers the same sort of things covered by the Clause we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, we find in the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, powers to require any person engaged in the white fish industry
	<br><blockquote><p>"to furnish to the Authority such returns and any information specified in the notice as the Authority may require for the discharge of their functions".</p></blockquote>
There are probably more people in the white fish industry than there are in business in the Highlands, and note there is no appearance of the word "reasonable" in the provisions of that Act. We were there concerned with giving powers to obtain information about almost anything concerning the industry, without the use of the saving word "reasonable". Thus I say that the powers with which we are concerned are individually precedented. What is unique about them is that here they are all given to one authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that this will create a new precedent. We are creating a new precedent by setting up the Board. No other Board has been set up by the Government with the powers and purposes of this Board. If we set up a new Board and create a precedent in this respect, clearly we will create precedents in regard to the powers under the Clause, the precedent being that there are combined in one authority a number of things which are in themselves precedented but which are not precedented when put together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) spoke about Drambuie. I understand that there is a possible legal interpretation that this would not be permissible under the Clause. I do not want to argue about this at the moment. It is not for me to try to judge what a Court might consider to be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
I was also asked whether the Board could ask for companies' accounts. I am told that the answer is "No". The obligation to provide information under the Clause does not specify the form and manner in which the information is to be provided. It it had been decided to give the Board power to impose further obligations as to the provision of information, this would have been done, as it has been done in other Statutes, such as the Emergency Laws (Re-enactment and Repeals) Act, 1964, Section 5(2,	<i>b</i>), or the Harbours Act, 1964, Section 41(1). Further, I understand that the Board cannot specify that the information be contained in prescribed documents—that is, in accounts. If this had been desired, express power to that effect would have been provided, as in Section 31 of the Income Tax Act, 1952, and other Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that under the Clause the Board can find out all the information it would need from the financial accounts if it wished to find out the financial affairs of a firm? The hon. Gentleman is saying that the Board cannot ask for the complete accounts. If it wanted to find out vital information, it could put specific questions and, under the Clause, the answers would have to be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board can find out all the information it might think might be in the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked, next, whether a firm could be recompensed if it were involved in substantial expenses in complying with a requirement under the Clause. We cannot see the possibility arising that the work would be so great as to require a great deal of expense. If the question did arise the firm itself would be able to claim that it was quite unreasonable to expect it to give the information asked for. It should also be noted that under its powers the Board, if the expenses were very large, would have power to assist a firm to meet the expenses involved. We do not, however, see the Board operating in this way. We do not foresee an inquisitorial procedure being followed by the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) spoke yesterday of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
graphic picture I once painted of inspectors crawling about my house. Hon. Members opposite have an equally graphic picture in their own minds of hordes of people crawling all over the Highlands seeking all sorts of information in order to cut out the person owning a private firm or a piece of land. This is not how the Board will operate. There is a tendency on the part of hon. Members opposite to exaggerate what is likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a Clause on which we disagree. As I have heard the debate up to the present, hon. Members opposite seem to object to the provisions about industry. If this is all they are objecting to, they might have tabled some Amendment to that effect. What they want to do is to prevent us from obtaining information about anything—in other words, the Board is not to know anything. This is a piece of nonsense, because in previous legislation hon. Members opposite have given all sorts of bodies powers to get information about different things. For them now to tell us that our Board must not be in the position of getting any information, does not add up. It would have been much more helpful if hon. Members opposite had, as I had expected, tabled Amendments concerning industry, which, as I have said, is apparently their primary concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is one on which we disagree and on which we shall have to vote. I assure the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (the Earl of Dalkeith) that I have listened to the debate. I shall read the Report of it very carefully. I will certainly give every consideration to the points made in the debate; but we think that the Board should have powers to get information. We therefore think that the Clause is essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Minister of State says that we have not been very helpful. He seems to suggest that, apart from saving the Committee hours of time by not talking about rubbish, we should also redraft the Bill for him. This is asking a little too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the points made about the Clause by my hon. Friends are entirely correct. They have not been answered in any way whatever by the Minister. In the first place he says that we on this
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
side want to prevent the Highland Board from obtaining information about anything. That is most certainly not so. What we object to is the powers which the Government are seeking to give the Board to obtain information about everything, and that is a very different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by several of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell), is that the powers which the Government propose to give to the Board by the Clause are unprecedented. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said that Lord Cameron had stated that these powers were precedented. By the usual fiddle of words which the Minister of State enjoys so much—I am sure that Lord Cameron did not intend to mislead anybody—the hon. Gentleman has shown clearly to the Committee that there is no precedent for powers of this sort being brought together and given to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State says, perfectly fairly, that this is an unprecedented Board and that therefore the Government are giving it unprecedented powers. Let there be no mistake about it that these powers have never before been given in this form to any Board. That is the simple point my hon. Friends have made. Various hon. Members have tried to cloud the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it is true that there are individual bits of these powers which are given to individual types of Boards. The case the Minister founded on most strongly on, the best case he could produce, was the White Fish Industry Bill. He produced many more examples, but the one he chose to tell us about was the White Fish Industry Bill. These powers are given in that Bill, because the Government are subsidising the white fish industry at a very high rate year after year. The Authority has to obtain information about profitability so that it can present to Parliament year after year its case for giving the taxpayers' money to the industry. This is in exactly the same way, as perhaps the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) will agree with me, though he does not often agree with me about anything, as the Department of Agriculture demands returns from farmers so that it can assess what money should be given by the taxpayers in the light of all the information
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
it has. This is an entirely separate thing from the powers which the Government seek to give the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point made by my hon. Friends, and which the Minister did not make the slightest effort to deal with, is the question of cost. What the Minister has carefully avoided saying, on this as on every other Clause of this sort when we have tried to get information from him so that we can judge his intentions and ideas, if any, is what these powers may be used for. We have not had a single example. We say that the cost might be considerable. When we were debating the ownership of land—I do not want to re-open the whole of that problem—hon. Members opposite said that powers existed under the Clause by which information could be got. I think that the Minister of State will agree that, if he served a notice on the Secretary of State to measure the acreage the Secretary of State owns, the operation would cost a minimum of between £1 million and £3 million. Measuring land in the Highlands is not like measuring the hon. Gentleman's washing green. Therefore, we have no idea of the sort of things for which the Board will need these powers. It is all very well to say that the Board must have wide ranging powers. What for? We have had no information. It is fair for us to ask what the cost will be and on whom it will fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the problem of the work involved. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), in a very good speech, explained as an example the cost of P.A.Y.E. It is considerable in businesses. It is borne by businesses and not by the Government. It is a very useful reverse subsidy from industry to the Government. In the Highlands there are many small businesses of one type or another
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
—for example, hotels arnd shops. If they have to provide certain information—they do not yet know what the information is; the Minister has told them nothing about it—they will have to keep far more careful records than many of them keep at present. Perhaps they should keep them already. The keeping of these more careful records will involve extra cost so that information can be provided to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the powers as envisaged in the Clause will be a serious deterrent to businesses coming to the Highlands, unless the Minister is to say, as has been said outside, that these powers are being put into the Highlands at the moment only because they are to be put to the rest of the country by future Bills. If this is so, the deterrent argument falls, because industry will be saddled with this sort of nonsense wherever it is in the country. If the Minister says that these powers are to be only in the Highlands and the areas concerned, this must be a deterrent to people coming in, because of the inevitable extra cost of providing information for the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, finally, the question of the secrecy of commercial and technical operations. The Minister says that he does not believe that this power will be used in that respect. It may well be that that is so, but every conceivable thing that the Board may want to get is clearly laid down in the Clause, in my view. It may be that the formal accounts of the company may not be asked for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
