Clause 7.—(ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment moved [6th May]</i> in page 4, line 32, to leave out "other"—<i>[Mr. Wylie.]</i></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I have said all that needs to be said on the Amendment. All that remains is to hear what the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said that his was a probing Amendment because he wanted to get an idea of the "other activity" which we have in mind and which is alluded to in paragraph <i>(c).</i><br><br>
As the hon. and learned Member suggested, this paragraph gives the Board residual powers for activities not mentioned in paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b).</i> One of the important activities in which the Board will have to involve itself, as we see it, is industrial liaison: the contacting of industrial enterprises outside the Highlands to interest them in the possibility of setting up in the Highlands. We would expect this kind of work to extend to the identification of products or methods of production in the South which could be undertaken by firms in the Highlands or by firms willing to settle there.<br><br>
Another kind of activity would be the search for lines of production for which rights of manufacture on licence, for example, might be negotiated on behalf of firms in the Highlands. This might involve survey work, which the Board will have power to undertake under Clause 9 (1,<i>d</i>).<br><br>
A further example would be the organising of suitable group-marketing arrangements for small firms. This would be a particularly important service, in relation to a problem which is constantly arising in the north.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
There will also be opportunities in the social, tourist and leisure spheres for the Board to exercise its residual powers under paragraph <i>(c).</i> For example, we expect there will be such matters as angling, sporting, and even bird watching, with the construction of hideouts, which is usually not done on a commercial basis. These matters would add to the amenities of the Highlands and would attract people there who are interested in those activities. All these might be covered by the general, enabling words which we have drafted in paragraph <i>(c).</i><br><br>
In connection with Amendment 106, which is being taken with 105, I hope that what I have said indicates why we have the words "other enterprises" in the paragraph. The Amendment would delete those words. From what I have said, I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will realise that it is important that the words "other enterprises" should remain in the Clause, and that he will now feel inclined to withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves this point I would try to bring his mind back to a matter which I raised much earlier during these proceedings. While I welcome the identification which he has given of the type of industries—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All right: activities, industrial activities—I specifically devoted time to deal with the type of new, technological and scientific industry such as the breeder industry which might be brought within the Clause. I mentioned also the petroleum industry and pointed to types of development, like the plastics industry, that might proceed from petroleum. There are other developments, like modern distillation and oil refinery. All these things could develop from this type of industry.<br><br>
When I made these suggestions I thought my hon. Friend the Minister of State indicated that those ideas were also in his mind and I thought he encouraged me. He has included no reference in what he said this morning to those developments, and I am wondering whether that exclusion means that the sort of industrial development I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 619</span>
mentioned is not to be given encouragement in the Highlands? Could he say something on this point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No matter what I said, it is quite possible that I would exclude something. One cannot think of every possibility, something is bound to be excluded. I mentioned one or two examples of the kind of thing we hoped to be able to pick up in this paragraph, but I had no intention of deliberate exclusion. This was not a cunning, Machiavellian plot to exclude the plastics industry. Certainly many of these things would be within the power of the Board. A development of the kind which my hon. Friend has in mind would be a large one which would probably necessitate a separate Act of Parliament, as the Corpach mill did. It is not excluded by the proposals of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for the explanation he has given to what was a probing Amendment. If industrial liaison, research and so forth were important and significant matters it would be better to have them referred to in the Clause. It is the normal practice to mention an important activity and at the same time to leave the residual power to pick up other activities which cannot all be listed at one time. I shall not press the Amendment, but will ask the Minister to consider widening the terms of the Clause so that some of the major activities which the Government have very properly in mind might be specified. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 100, in page 4, line 33, after "expedient" to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or as the Secretary of State may direct".</p></blockquote>
This is an important Amendment, to provide for occasions when the Board may appear to the Secretary of State to be in the wrong. We must remember that the proposed Board will not be either omnipotent or omniscient. I am concerned with what will no doubt be the odd occasion when the Board fails to act.<br><br>
There might, for example, be an occasion when the Consultative Council, which will be a very strong and repre-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
sentative body for the Highlands, feels that something ought to be done by the Board, while the Board, on the other hand, may, by majority decision, show that it is not very anxious to proceed on the advice of the Consultative Council. The matter at issue might be of very considerable importance and it might be an occasion on which to appeal to the Secretary of State. That situation might arise from time to time; the Council and the Board may not always agree. We must not assume that the Board will be always right and the Consultative Council always wrong, or the other way round.<br><br>
When such a case comes along, and when the Secretary of State feels that there should be a direction in relation to either a general or specific matter, the words I am proposing to insert into the paragraph would meet the situation. I think it would be worth while having this reserve power for the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister of State said in his reply to me a few minutes ago on the previous Amendment. I would add to what I said, because this Amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) is important in relation to the matter raised on the previous Amendment.<br><br>
The Minister of State said that the matters I was raising would appear to require further legislation. That was rather alarming. When we have created the Board to develop the Highlands, are we to find that still further legislation will be required when the Board wants to go ahead with other developments? If so, the development of the Highlands will indeed be lengthy. By passing the present Amendment we shall put into the hands of the Secretary of State sufficient power to do everything that ought to be done for Highland development, not merely on the agricultural side but on the industrial and the amenity sides. That would be a complete power to go ahead, sanctioned by Parliament, for the development of the Highlands. This power would be given to the Secretary of State to take such action as he thinks fit towards accomplishing what it is hoped that Bill will do.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 621</span>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister of State is aware that what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) is trying to do under Clause 7(c) is to give all the powers for any purposes mentioned in Clauses 2, 4, 11 and every other Clause. This is turning the Bill upside down and it makes nonsense of the whole consideration we have had so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has mentioned the first point I had intended to make. It also tends to cover earlier remarks made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). The way the Bill is framed must be considered. There are, first, the duties of the Board. Then there are the specific powers relating to land. Then there are the specific powers relating to buildings and the provision of services for buildings. Then there are the specific powers relating to acquiring, setting up and carrying on any business. Then we come to Clause 7, which deals with advisory and other services. The rubric of the Clause indicates what the Clause deals with. Later on we come on to deal with grants and loans. After that, there is a more or less general enabling Clause which covers the ancillary powers of the Board which have not been previously dealt with.<br><br>
That means that this Clause deals with advisory and other services. It is not intended under paragraph <i>(c)</i> to give to the Board the powers which have been discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin). I answered my hon. Friend's question out of courtesy because he asked me about a huge enterprise he has in mind for Invergordon, an enterprise which I understand would cost something of the order of £30 million or £40 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said only that I hardly thought that that was likely under the Bill. It would probably require a separate Bill. The Amendment would give the Secretary of State powers to issue specific directions. This is not the intention of the Bill. It is not common to give Ministers powers to give specific directions to bodies of this kind. It certainly was not our intention that the Secretary of State should have specific
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 622</span>
powers to interfere in the day-to-day working of the Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an exaggeration to say that the Amendment means interference in the day-to-day business of the Board. It is a distortion of the purpose of the Amendment to say that it means that the Secretary of State should so interfere in the day-to-day working of the Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Clause deals with advisory and other services which, although they are important, are really subsidiary to the other functions of the Board in relation to land and business. To that extent, the Amendment would give to the Secretary of State powers to interfere with what, after all, is a subsidiary activity of the Board. We do not think that that is desirable. In this matter we agree with hon. Members opposite. This is one of the Clauses in which the Secretary of State is not mentioned. We do not wish to bring him into this Clause. We think that it would interfere too much in the work of the Board if the Secretary of State had this power.<br><br>
I have said on previous Amendments that we would expect that the chairman of the Board will be in constant contact with the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State has anything to say to the Board, he could say it in the course of his conversations. If he wants to talk over a particular matter and suggest to the Board that it might, or should, consider doing something, he could do it in that manner, without issuing specific instructions to the Board. We believe that it would damage the Board's image, if it were to be subject to that kind of interference. Therefore, I must ask my hon. Friend not to press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In thanking my hon. Friend very much for that reply I take this opportunity to say again that the Amendment is not for interference by the Secretary of State in the day-to-day operations of the Board. Nobody would want that in the least. The character of the Amendments I have already moved has shown that I certainly am not a supporter of the view that the Secretary of State should be brought in in any inhibitive or restrictive capacity. This is an opportunity for the Secretary of State to come in in a more positive and helpful way.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0671">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 623</span>
In certain circumstances the Board itself might welcome the addition of the power of the Secretary of State not in restriction of, but in furtherance of, activities which the Board might not feel completely competent itself or equipped by the rest of the Bill to carry on. I am sure that at some time the stage will be reached when the members of the Board will, for financial reasons or otherwise, worry about whether some action might not verge on legislation and require the introduction of a Fort William pulp mill type of Bill. A little more than consultation is necessary in certain circumstances. If the members of the Board need to be strengthened in their activities and feel that the other powers of the Bill to date are not sufficient for a particular objective at a particular moment, whether it would be for financial or other reasons, there might well be a case for it suggesting to the Secretary of State that he gives it a definite ruling in the form of a direction. That sort of case might well arise. The idea of bringing the Secretary of State in here is not to hamper the Board or to interfere. There might be the odd time when the Board would not be as completely perfect as we would wish it to be.<br><br>
The introduction of the Secretary of State has two purposes: that he should be available to the Board, first, to strengthen its arm where it does not feel completely competent or equipped by the Bill to carry out a particular project, and secondly where the Board itself, in the Secretary of State's view, is not carrying out its full functions, even in a case where it has the advice of the Consultative Council, for example, and where it might be desirable to strengthen its arm, whether it wants it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has rightly said that the kind of argument advanced by the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) was not appropriately argued on this Clause. I think the hon. Gentleman would agree that the case he made did not relate specifically to this Clause but more to general circumstances about the powers and duties of the Board.<br><br>
One point which has arisen on what the Minister of State has said causes me to ask one specific question. In his reply the Minister of State indicated that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
it was not general or normal to give directions of the sort envisaged in the Amendment to "bodies of this sort". I wondered what the hon. Gentleman meant by "bodies of this sort". The only similar bodies I can think of to which it is competent to give a general direction, but not detailed directions, are the Boards of the nationalised industries. It may be that the Minister of State was thinking of these when he talked about other similar bodies. If he was not thinking about these, I would like to know which he was thinking about.<br><br>
If the Minister of State was thinking of the kind of accountability we have from nationalised industries, this raises one detailed point which relates directly to the Amendment. I refer to the question of parliamentary accountability. This question was not dealt with in detail on Second Reading. In view of what the Minister of State said about the question of similar bodies, will the parliamentary accountability of the Board be of a similar nature to the parliamentary accountability of the nationalised industries? In other words, if it is, we shall not be able to ask Questions about the Board's detailed functions or about what work it is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister of State for the encouragement he is giving me on one idea I am trying to advance. I am sure that he will welcome my returning to this point, because it must revive many memories in his mind. If one does not succeed on something on the first Clause, one must come back on the second and on the third. One must hammer away at it all the time in whatever guise one can, because if one believes it to be right it must continually be pressed. I have had no greater teacher in this respect than my hon. Friend. I am humbly following in his trail.<br><br>
I have read the rubric, I realise that the Clause deals with advisory and other services. These advisory services cover
<br><blockquote><p>"the introduction or development of industrial, commercial and other enterprises."</p></blockquote>
I fail to see in what way the Amendment turns the Bill upside down. That language is the sort of rhetorical hyperbole which comes very easily from the lips of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble), but which is far removed from the facts.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0672">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 625</span>
If it be true—I do not deny it; I know that distillation plants are not penny-farthing operations—that it costs £30 million to introduce such a project into the Highlands, that is the level of economic and financial thinking which we should be aiming at if we are thinking of making the Highlands not just a separate development in Scotland, but part of the development of Scotland. Therefore, I do not shudder or shiver at the mentioned that any development I suggest may cost £30 million. I would look for more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) asked what I had in mind when I spoke of similar bodies. I had in mind nationalised industries, although I appreciate that this is not a nationalised industry. This is a Board with quite different functions. Nevertheless, in regard to its administration we have always thought that it should be free of day-to-day control by the Secretary of State. In other words, it is given a remit by the Bill and it should be left to get on with it.<br><br>
There has been much discussion already about the fact that the Board has to go to the Secretary of State for powers. Efforts have been made to reduce this. I can understand that. Nevertheless, we want as much as possible to see the Board getting on with the job that it has in hand and not to be subject to day-to-day interference. We shall be dealing with accountability and how the Board will be financed on later Clauses. The Opposition have tabled certain Amendments concerning the financing of the Board and its accounts. That would probably be a better time to discuss this than at present. The accountability of the Board hardly arises on this Clause, and I would prefer to leave that question until we reach it, otherwise we shall be rather out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister of State answer the other point I raised? Let us assume that an hon. Member has a constituent or a factory in his constituency affected by the activities of the Board. Will it be competent for that hon. Member to raise the matter directly with the Government, or will he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
be told, as so often happens in the case of the nationalised industries, that he must write direct to the chairman of the Highland Board as it is not a matter for the Government? If this is so, it presents a very serious problem.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that in a case of that kind the Member would approach the Board and perhaps suggest that something which it was doing was not in the public interest and to put his complaint to it. There is nothing wrong with a Member of Parliament doing that. Members already do this in a number of cases. If they have complaints about the nationalised industries they take them to the nationalised industries. If, however, it is an important issue which should come before the House or the Minister, then it goes to the Minister. I cannot see any difficulties about this form of procedure. It may be that we have not worked out the correct and best procedures for the nationalised industries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have gone far enough on this point. We are considering whether the Secretary of State should give a direction. We are not dealing with accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. I have already said that I do not want to deal with the question of accountability. I was simply answering a point about how the Clause would operate. I apologise, and I leave the point at once.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) said that it might be necessary for the Secretary of State to give a direction to the Board, and, indeed, that the Board might ask for a direction. I said on a previous occasion and this morning that we expect the chairman of the Board to be in frequent contact with the Secretary of State. Clearly, if the Board had any doubts about its powers under the Bill it might say in the course of conversation with the Secretary of State or officials, "We would like to do such and such a thing. Have we powers under the Bill to do it?". The Secretary of State would then say, "Frame your proposals and we will look at them." This is what would happen in practice. If the powers were not in the Bill, the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0673">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 627</span>
State could not approve them, neither could he give a direction for them to be carried out.<br><br>
Therefore, with great deference to my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles, who usually sees through all these points very quickly, I do not accept the validity of 'his line of argument. I do not think that it is very sound. We would prefer the Secretary of State not to be brought into the Clause at all. We want the Board to get on with its job. We do not think that my hon. Friend's proposal would enhance the Board's prestige. Although I do not rate it very highly. I see the possibility that it might lead to a certain amount of friction if the Secretary of State could give special instructions to the Board.<br><br>
I ask my hon. Friend not to press the Amendment. Having given the matter a considerable amount of thought, as I have no doubt he has, I do not think that it would strengthen the Board or that it would achieve anything other than, perhaps, cause a certain amount of friction and diminution in the Board's prestige.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of saving time, and possibly to save me from getting into an involved argument with my hon. Friend the Minister of State, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move <i>Amendment No. 101,</i> in page 4, line 33, to leave out "or development" and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>",operation or development, whether by the Board or other persons,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be convenient to discuss at the same time Amendment No. 70 in line 33, after "development" insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or operation by the Board or by other persons".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I saw that Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan), I thought that it raised a good point. We had not mentioned the operation of industrial, commercial or other enterprises and therefore it struck me that we should include the word "operation". At the same time, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 628</span>
had not mentioned that this provision applied to undertakings operated by the Board or by other persons, and therefore I thought we should include provision to that effect, too.<br><br>
The Amendments clarify paragraph <i>(c),</i> and I should like to express my gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles for having tabled his Amendment, which drew our attention to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister of State for accepting the general purpose of my Amendment and for improving the wording of it. The Amendment is technically more effective in this form than the wording which I proposed.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we move away from this Clause I should like to say one or two words about it. Having been fairly critical about bits of the Bill, I think this Clause is one of the most important Clauses in the Bill, and I have the greatest possible sympathy with it.<br><br>
A problem which from time to time faces us in the Highlands concerns the great industries. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has referred to the £30 million enterprise at Invergordon. There is also the pulp mill at Fort William. Those of us who know the Highlands well and who live and work there realise that for each of these great projects which arise from time to time there is inevitably needed a very large number of small enterprises, employing, perhaps, ten or fifteen people, which are admirably suitable for many small communities and which can make the difference between a small community flourishing or dying.<br><br>
In the past ten or fifteen years, in England under N.A.A.S. and in Scotland under the Colleges of Agriculture, we have seen what can be done to raise efficiency and productivity on farms by making available officers from the colleges and from N.A.A.S. who go round and give advice—sometimes whether it is wanted or not—to small people who, without their help, would perhaps be unable to improve their techniques. This
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0674">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 629</span>
will be a most important part of the Board's work which, I hope, it will take very seriously from the word "go".<br><br>
Those hon. Members with experience of industry will know that there are available many consultants for industrial purposes. It is not unfair to say that a certain number of them are extremely expensive and that the benefits which they bring are not always immediately evident. Certainly, in view of the scale on which they operate, they are far beyond the money resources of the sort of firms which I have in mind.<br><br>
Paragraph <i>(b)</i> says that the Board shall have power
<br><blockquote><p>"to promote or assist in the promotion of publicity relating to the Highlands and Islands."</p></blockquote>
I should like to ask the Minister of State whether he intends to use this provision to provide the finance which may be necessary for things like tourist boards.<br><br>
The Minister raised an important question on group marketing. I agree with what he said. I have in mind a firm which is very much interested in group marketing and which is very progressive in this respect in Scotland but which has had a rather dusty answer from the President of the Board of Trade. It is not able to get the help which it wants. Firms such as this which are operating group marketing schemes may well be in some difficulty if they can get assistance for their work in the Highlands but not for the work which they do in Aberdeenshire and other areas where their work is important to them, naturally. Perhaps the Minister will think more carefully about the group marketing problem. If there are problems of the sort which I have mentioned which should be met, I hope that he will ask his right hon. Friends to meet them.<br><br>
On paragraph <i>(c),</i> while it is all very well to say that we shall provide technical and advisory services for businesses which are set up and running, and help with publicity and group marketing for businesses which are still running, one of the real needs in the Highlands is help for people to get started. Perhaps this is envisaged under paragraph <i>(c).</i> I have had a great many cases in my constituency and outside of small firms which wanted help from B.O.T.A.C. I do not say that the highly competent independent people who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 630</span>
make up B.O.T.A.C. are being unfair. They are protecting the taxpayers' interests. However, the sort of questionnaires which they send to people who want to start a small business are frightening. The sort of information which they want is often too difficult for these people to give. Unless the firm in question can be put in touch with the Scottish Council or the special offices of the Board of Trade in Glasgow, or something of that sort, the man takes one look at the forms and collapses. I hope very much that help will be given.<br><br>
This is the main reason why during my administration we gave extra money to the Highland Fund. We felt, rightly or wrongly, that those who administered the Fund were more approachable and easier for small Highland businessmen to contact. Perhaps the same field officers who will help under paragraph <i>(a)</i> will, when they are in an area, look out for small industries which could be started and then help and encourage people to get started and to fill up the forms.<br><br>
If we could get 100 new businesses a year in the Highlands employing an average of 15 to 20 people it would make a tremendous difference in a large number of places. I hope that the Board, while by no means ignoring £30 million projects, will concentrate on operations on a small scale, because they are of the greatest importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree with the remarks of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) about the importance of this Clause and the good work which we all hope will be done as a result of it. I wish merely to ask the Minister of State a couple of questions to elucidate the way in which he anticipates the Board will do certain things or will be enabled to do them. Owing to the fact that the Clause has not been severely amended, there has not been a great deal of discussion on it.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Paragraph <i>(a)</i> refers to the provision of facilities for advisory training, etcetera. It seems to me that there has been a tendency by Governments to try to put the whole question of apprenticeship training and that sort of thing—further education—into the hands of local education authorities. For example, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0675">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 631</span>
Scottish Country Industries Development Trust—known as S.C.I.D.T.—is no longer undertaking the training of welding apprentices. It is considered that this should appropriately be undertaken by education authorities. I am interested to discover whether there is a tendency by Government to put these various facilities more and more on to education authorities, and if so, how the Board will come in. Will it be through the education authorities and will it employ people, or second people? What method will it adopt?<br><br>
In respect of paragraph <i>(b)</i> I should like to know a little more about the relationship between the Board and the Scottish Tourist Board. A number of people in the Highlands are concerned about the £150,000 special grant to assist with tourist information bureaux. The Secretary of State has said that he is thinking in terms of some sort of subsidy. If the Board is to be given power to assist in the promotion of publicity presumably that will in a large measure refer to tourism. It would also be concerned with advertising, with the attraction of industry and with promoting the attractiveness of coming to the north. But the large part of the Board's activities would be concerned with tourism and I should like to know something about the relationship between the Board and the S.T.B., whether it will be a financial relationship, or what other ideas the Minister may have in mind.<br><br>
I commend this Clause. Provided some attention is paid to the remarks by the right hon. Member for Argyll about the complication of applying for money, which seems to be involved in any Government Department, I think it will prove a great success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the remarks of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) I wish to make clear that I have been emphasising the need for large units on the industrial side, but that does not mean that I am prejudiced against small units, either industrial or agricultural. My view is one which is welcome in the Highlands. I should like to quote from a letter which I have received from a gentleman who has been a farmer, all his life in the Highlands, in Inverness-shire. He states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 632</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"A lot has been said against the small farmer, that his days are done, and that he cannot make a decent living. This is nonsense. In my countryside a few of the farmers have no more than 150 breeding ewes, and 12 cows, but they can still buy a new car and pay Income Tax. This is due to good husbandry and hard work at the right time, and the willing energetic application of expert knowledge of their own place. Their freedom and way of life is their real reward."</p></blockquote>
The spirit is in the Highlands and if it is supported by the Government, as I hope it will be, I am certain that the development which we all want to see will take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reinforce the remarks of the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) about training and to ask whether it will be undertaken directly by the Board or through the local education authorities. I have noted that where new industrial development comes to an area in which previously there has not been much industry, often there is a lack of co-ordination between local schools and the education authority and the type of industry being developed in the area. As a result, young people are not made aware of the opportunities available to them in the industry or of the advantage of learning a particular skill which may be required.<br><br>
I think it important that opportunities for industrial or commercial development in the Highlands and elsewhere in the north should be made known overseas as well as throughout the rest of Britain. In the central belt of Scotland the industrial areas have the advantage of trade organisations and chambers of commerce for making known the opportunities which exist in those areas. In the more scattered areas of the Highlands there are no such facilities. I hope that the Highland Development Board will be a co-ordinating body and provide publicity and information of this nature.<br><br>
An example has been provided in the Highlands by the activities of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, which has done a considerable amount in publicising opportunities existing there. The Board held an exhibition in the Midlands indicating the opportunities which existed in its area, and as a result at Stonehaven, Kincardine, in my constituency, we now have a plastics factory where kitchen furniture is made.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0676">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 633</span>
This resulted directly from an inquiry made at the exhibition. I pay tribute to what has been done by the Hydro-Electric Board and I hope that the Highland Development Board will follow that example.<br><br>
What may be done in this direction will be limited unless there is also cooperation from local authorities and other local interests in dealing with inquiries which may result. In the example to which I referred the inquiry was taken up by the Stonehaven Town Council and the Provost, and now a factory is being established. I wish to make a particular plea that there should be co-operation by local authorities and other local interests with the work of the Board in connection with publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to start by saying something about publicity, but before doing so, I should like to join with the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in his tribute to the work done by the Hydro-Electric Board in endeavouring to attract, industry to the north. Its efforts have met with a fair amount of success.<br><br>
The Highland Board will be able to engage in publicity in the widest sense. Under the provisions contained in the Bill it will be possible for the Board to undertake the kind of activities mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. It is under an obligation to co-operate with local authorities and other bodies functioning in the Highlands. I agree that there is a responsibility on local authorities to co-operate with the Board if we are to achieve the best results. Under the provisions in the Bill the Board can also engage in publicity in connection with tourism, and undoubtedly, in co-operation with the Scottish Tourist Board, it will undertake a certain amount of that work. I cannot say how it will be done; that is for the Board to determine. I am frequently asked what the Board will do, and more often than not the answer is that it is for the Board to decide. There are powers in the Bill, but I cannot foretell what form co-operation will take.<br><br>
No doubt a great deal of the Board's activities will be in connection with tourism, including publicity. The question of tourism is under consideration at present because of what will transpire between the Tourist Board and the High-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 634</span>
land Development Board. At the moment I cannot say what will develop, but the Board has all the powers necessary to carry on this work.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) referred to training activities, and I will say something about the future of the Scottish Country Industries Development Trust in the light of the powers given to the Board. At present the work undertaken by S.C.I.D.T. is similar to the work which the Board is given power to undertake in the Clause. It would be wrong to duplicate the services. As the Board will be closely involved in the provision of buildings and assisting with the existing and potential enterprises in the Highlands and Islands, the services and activities covered by the powers in this Clause must be linked closely with arrangements to help industry under the other two Clauses.<br><br>
There are one or two things which have to be worked out with S.C.I.D.T. We had in mind that the Board should under take the services at present provided by S.C.I.D.T. This would not preclude the possibility of the Board and the Trust making suitable arrangements for professional or technical officers of one of the bodies to be used, as necessary, by the other. We hope there will be some co-operation in this respect. We think this the most economic and convenient manner to employ the staff. Nor does this mean that the rôle of S.C.I.D.T. will be any less important. It will still have a vast job to do outside the seven crofting counties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister has said about S.C.I.D.T. Is this the main reason why S.C.I.D.T. is no longer able to disperse funds? It ceased to be able to do so when the extra grant was given to the Highland Fund. Is it because it is the intention that the Highland Development Board should take over its functions anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer that question fully off the cuff, but I will get the answer for the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The Board will have powers if necessary to undertake training, which it might do in certain isolated cases. We expect the Board to operate through the education authorities. Clearly, that would be the best and most efficient way. It could also make general recommendations, for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 635</span>
example, to the Secretary of State about certain services which it thought ought to be provided in the Highland area, and the Secretary of State could draw the attention of the local authorities to the desirability, and possibly the necessity, for doing something. In the final result, in the isolated cases where nothing could be done by local education authorities, and it was necessary to train one or two people, the Board could undertake this work.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) referred to this Clause during the Second Reading debate. Generally speaking, he praised it. I appreciate the points he made in connection with group marketing and small businesses, but I do not think he referred to anything which requires a specific answer from me.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
He mentioned certain advisory services on Second Reading and said that special regard should be paid to them. Although he did not specify them, one concerned land use and the other the costing of farm operations. These matters are important in the Highland area, but the responsibility for the provision of advisory services in agriculture rests with the appropriate agricultural college. It is not the intention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the Board should operate parallel services to those which are already being provided by a college in any area. Indeed, this is the principle behind the Bill, that services already existing are not duplicated. It will be open to the Board, however, where there is need for the expansion of a particular advisory service, to take the necessary steps, which will mean consulting my right hon. Friend and the college concerned. It will be open to the Board to suggest the expansion of any existing services, and that suggestion can be made to the college or to my right hon. Friend. It is not intended that the Board should itself set out to run rival services.<br><br>
I think that I have covered most of the points which have been raised. We regard the Clause as most important. I agree with the remarks which have been made about the difficulties facing the individual in the Highlands who is anxious to start a small business and, clearly, assistance in this matter will be one of the main functions of the Board.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 636</span>
It must be remembered, too, that the difficulties do not end when a business has been started. In many cases the person concerned must, during the early stages of operation, learn such things as the keeping of books and the running of the business. There are many general management and accountancy matters and techniques to be learnt and under the Clause the Board can provide assistance to such a person, not only when he starts his business but also during the initial stages. This will help businesses to become established.<br><br>
I am glad that the Clause has received the general welcome of the Committee, because, as I say, we regard it as a most important provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, of course, with my hon. Friend that the Clause is important. Indeed, it is one of the most important in the Bill, and I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister of State has enabled the Committee to improve it during our Committee deliberations.<br><br>
As the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has said and others of us have said on many occasions in the debates, it is important that the Board should realise the value of existing industries and activities in addition to the need to establish new ones. The priorities must be right and the Board should understand that the extension and expansion of existing industries particularly important in achieving the purpose of retaining the local populations, as far as possible in their own localities.<br><br>
It is not sufficient that the Board's purpose and functions under the Clause and elsewhere in the Bill should be to retain the total population of the Highlands within the Highland region. It is also vitally important that the characteristic distribution of the population should be maintained, and that can only be done by sustaining the existing local industries and by expanding and modernising them. It does not take a great deal of imagination in many cases to know how that can be done. Sometimes it needs a little extra help of the type which at present is not being provided by any existing agencies. Certainly most local authorities are not equipped to provide such help.<br><br>
It is important briefly to consider the position of Highland Fund and the allocation of the money made available
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0678">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 637</span>
to it by the Government for aiding various projects for which help is asked. Some people have had doubts about the freedom of the Fund to allocate and administer the funds made available to it by the Government. Indeed, the Fund appears to have doubts itself, and it seems that when somebody asks for help for a project the Fund goes back on each occasion to the Secretary of State to discuss the matter. Some people believe that the Fund is obliged to do that, although I imagine that the money made available to it is meant to be administered by the Fund, as an experienced and responsible body with considerable independence of action. I have always understood that the Fund had reasonable freedom to make loans and grants up to a certain ceiling in cases it approved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister of State will know of a special case which I have in mind in my constituency. In that case the Highland Fund was not willing to risk the money directly under its own independent control to sustain an enterprise in my area which is in great difficulty. At the same time, the Fund has not been prepared, on its own authority and initiative, to make a loan to this firm out of the money it is administering.<br><br>
The Minister may tell me that, as I believe is the case, that the Fund already has sufficient freedom of decision and action in administering the public funds made available to it. It may well be that it is doing its job well, and will not be superseded in handling these public funds by the Development Board. Whatever the position really is to be, we should be told about it now.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have spoken about small firms in their constituencies and of their need for capital and loans. It is important that we should know whether we are, through the Development Board, going to have something new and bigger in this sphere in which the Highland Fund has operated on that smaller scale.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Argyll stressed the importance of doing something not just in one or two centres and a few major projects, but in a large number of places by way of assisting a great many smaller projects. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree with him. He suggested the desirability of aiming at per-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
haps 100 small enterprises in the Highlands rather than concentrating on just a few large projects. I agree, not necessarily with his figures, but with the principle he adumbrated and which I have frequently put forward. We need projects like Fort William pulp mill and the proposed science-based industries such as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) mentioned earlier. At the same time, we want to see various local industries developing. Many of them have a potential which is being very inadequately developed at present. Development of such local industries and activities will help to retain local populations, in their own areas, which is a vital matter.<br><br>
The danger all the time has been that of drawing people away, to bigger centres from the areas which are already depopulated. This results in turn in even further depopulation, because unless there is something more than seasonal jobs and part-time activity going on locally they must leave to find a livelihood. That is why I emphasised—and I was grateful for the support I have received from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—the importance of regional continuous moorland regeneration schemes, among other projects. These could provide a fair number of people with insurable employment locally while, at the same time, keeping them on the land. As I said in an earlier debate, this is one way to provide a valuable second job and raising living standards. That is the key even to the problem of sustaining crofting and agriculture. The second job is what brings in money which enables people to stay on the land while, at the same time, enjoying a standard of living more comparable with that in other parts of the country. That job may be in agriculture or in the new industry we hope to see.<br><br>
This Clause may in some ways become one of the three major operative parts of the Bill. From now on it will depend on the Board, its members and, to a large extent, on the enthusiasm with which the task is approached, and upon the support financial and otherwise, given by the Secretary of State and the Government of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will intervene again briefly to answer some additional points. I agreed with the general tenor of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 639</span>
speech of my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). Concerning the Treasury Loan Scheme, there is no question of having to go back to the Secretary of State within the agreed arrangements which permit the Highland Fund to make loans of up to £7,500.<br><br>
I said when I spoke last that I would try to find the answer to a question asked by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). The Treasury Loan Scheme was set up to take the place of the Rural Industries Fund in the Highlands and Islands. That probably accounts for the stopping of the funds through S.C.I.D.T. While S.C.I.D.T. does not disburse funds for financial assistance, it is responsible for advising the Rural Industries Fund on whether such loans should be made. This has been taken over by the Treasury Loan Scheme and we expect that the Highlands Development Board will, when set up, take that over, and that the scheme will be rather larger and that the sums involved will be rather larger, too.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
Clause 8.—(GRANTS AND LOANS.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 36, to leave out from "(1)" to "Board", in line 37, and to insert "The".<br><br>
The effect of this Amendment would be to take out from the beginning of the Clause, which deals with grants and loans, the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"In accordance with arrangements approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
We would like to know what the Government visualise as the arrangements which are mentioned here. Our impression is that the Board will have to refer to the Secretary of State and the Treasury when considering individual grants and loans, but this is not clear, and we shall be interested to hear what the Government have in mind.<br><br>
The Minister will know, from remarks which my hon. Friends and I have made both on Second Reading and in Committee, that we hoped that there would be a certain discretion given to the Board
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 640</span>
so that it would be able, within limits, itself to decide the making of grants and loans; that is, that it would, in the case of grants, be able to approve individual grants up to a certain limit and that there would be a financial limit for the total number of grants during the course of a financial year. We also felt that the same thing could apply to loans; that there could be a limit for any individual loan, and a total limit, for, say, a financial year, for all the loans which the Board could make, and that any projects for which grants and loans seemed desirable but which went beyond those limits would then have to be referred to the Secretary of State. That seemed to us to give the Board reasonable discretion in the matter. The Government may have something of this kind in mind, and therefore we would be glad to know what the words at the beginning of the Clause are supposed to mean.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope I can satisfy the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) by my answer to his Amendment. It is not intended that the grants and loans given by the Board will supersede those given by existing agencies such as the crofting grants or the Board of Trade loans. These will carry on. It is desirable, however, that the arrangements for grants and loans by the Board should be compatible with existing arrangements, in order to avoid confusion and unnecessary overlapping. Crofting grants and Board of Trade loans are subject to arrangements made, with the approval of the Treasury, by the appropriate Minister. From the point of view of consistency alone it is desirable that the Treasury should be associated with the Secretary of State in approving the arrangements.<br><br>
In this case, there is the additional reason that the Secretary of State already administers the crofting grants and most of the agricultural grants in the Highlands, and is therefore in a special position of experience and knowledge in this field. There is no suggestion in the Clause that the Secretary of State need sanction every grant or loan, but only that he makes' the arrangements' for their provision. Once a decision has been reached between the Board, the Secretary of State and the Treasury on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0680">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 641</span>
how the grants and loans are to be administered, the Board will be free to administer them within the arrangements that have been made.<br><br>
It is for the Board in the first place to submit arrangements for approval. Preliminary consideration is already being given by the Departments regarding the general principles on which arrangements might be based. This is desirable in order to minimise any time lag in getting the financial assistance provisions into operation. We are anxious that the Highlands and Islands should benefit under the Clause as soon as possible.<br><br>
The kind of thing we expect is that the arrangements will be wider than the existing Treasury Loan Scheme in that they will include both loans and grants, and that the limits of the schemes will be very much in advance of the present limit of £7,500 for Treasury loans administered by the Highland Fund.<br><br>
There is no intention that the Board should have to seek the approval of the Secretary of State for every loan but only that the original scheme must be approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury. I hope that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman and that he will now be willing to withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From what the Minister has said it appears that one reason for these words is that there should not be duplication because the Secretary of State is already, in certain fields, making grants, or is responsible for approval grants. I can see that aspect of the matter. The Secretary of State may already in one capacity be responsible for grants in a certain area and therefore he would make sure that nothing was suggested by the Board which might overlap them.<br><br>
None the less, I think the Board could have been given more discretion and that this could have been written into the Bill. The Minister says that work has already started administratively, which seems to recognise that it is necessary to make sure that these financial arrangements will be ready as soon as the Board is set up and can get working. We hoped that this administrative work could get far enough to be brought into the Bill, perhaps at a later stage, to indicate how much discretion the Board would have.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
The Minister also said that he visualised the limits being part of the scheme, on the lines which I suggested, and that the arrangements described would include a general permission for grants and loans up to certain limits. I see the Minister nodding, so I assume that this statement has his assent. Therefore we have, from what the Minister has said, a statement that he visualises the sort of scheme which we had in mind, but we would much preferred to have seen written more clearly into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We might want to change it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said the other day, it is one thing to have something said in this Committee but quite another to have it written into the Bill. The important thing is what goes into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps on harping on the point about writing it into the Bill. Surely it is better to be able to change the scheme in accordance with circumstances without having to introduce amending legislation every time? As time passes, the scheme can be developed without the necessity of new legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could not go much further than what is already written into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can do anything under this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government can also do nothing. The key word is "arrangements". The Minister has brought the words to life by telling us the kind of things he has in mind, and we are grateful for that. Without his statement, we should have been none the wiser by simply reading the Clause as drafted. I was suggesting that this could have been spelled out in the Bill without giving the actual limits at this stage. It might say that the Board would have discretion within certain limits which would be announced later and could be changed from time to time; that is the kind of thing we hoped would be written into the Bill.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Minister has satisfied us that what is in the mind of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
Government follows more or less the lines which we had hoped. It is not as good as having it written into the Clause—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—but in view of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had another thought on these matters. Do the grants and loans provided for by the Clause fall within the term "cost of operations" used towards the end of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill? Are they included in the £1 million, which the financial part of the Memorandum envisages for 1968–69? The Minister's answer will give us a rough idea of what the Government have in mind and of the size of the grants and loans which will be operating in three years' time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now beginning to get a clear picture of the effect which the proposed Board will have on the existing situation in the Highlands. It will not interfere with any special grants and the B.O.TA.C. loans will continue. I can see the Board having a greater degree of control, because the Minister has said on a number of occasions that he wants to avoid duplication. I think there is an area of duplication which it will be rather difficult to resolve.<br><br>
We gather that, among other funds, the Highland Fund will go, or at least the Treasury element in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Probably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about risk capital? What about a scheme which has a less than fifty-fifty chance of success? With the Treasury breathing down his neck a man may not find it possible to take risks. We all know that if the Treasury sees a risk coming it makes off in the opposite direction. If one is 10 develop enterprises and have the full advantage of applying business tact and initiative, one must take a chance; it means "chancing your arm". I am wondering whether such people will be able, in the circumstances, to persuade their bank managers to lend them money.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 644</span>
What about people with schemes which may not get on their feet easily? Are they to have a new opportunity?<br><br>
It may be that the discretion of the Board will have to be wider than at first sight appears. The Minister may not, as he says, be able to say exactly what the Board will do, but perhaps he can give us some idea of it, as his ideas are probably quite important in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) asked me what would happen to the person who had ideas for a business which did not present itself as a straight success, by which I assume he means that it probably would not come within the criteria of B.O.T.A.C. The answer is rather simpler if put in those terms. It is the intention that the Board should be able to help industries which do not fall within those criteria. That is the essence of the scheme. We regard it as essential that worthwhile projects which might not fulfil statutory criteria but have good prospects of success, given the extra assistance required to meet special needs or difficulties arising from location in the Highlands, should be brought within the Development Board's field of consideration. Without such flexibility we should simply be repeating the pattern of the past, which has not been altogether successful. We want the Board to have more powers and to be in a position to develop, having in mind the necessity of other objectives such as the social aspect of things.<br><br>
The question asked me by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) was how much of these schemes came within the figure £1 million mentioned in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. That figure, as I have said before, is a very rough estimate of what we thought the Board might spend each year, by 1968–69. It might be less or more. There is nothing magical about the figure and it does not mean very much. We might be wrong. I would therefore enter that <i>caveat.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question is not so much about the approximate value of the figure. I quite understand that is simply an approximate figure. Could the Minister tell us whether the grants and loans fall within the expression
<br><blockquote><p>"cost of operations directly carried out by it"?</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 645</span>
I am not sure whether grants and loans can be described as "for operations directly carried out". It will make a considerable difference to even the approximate value of the figure if we know first of all whether the grants and loans are in or out.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was, first, making the point, which I think should be made, because there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the £1 million, that there is nothing very sacred about the figure. It depends entirely upon what is done between now and 1968–69 and what schemes are approved by the Secretary of State and by the Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister of State a little further on this point, but it is a matter of great importance. There was criticism of the figure of £1 million originally. I understand the Minister's statement that it was impossible to make an accurate forecast in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. However, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can get away with his argument, in face of this criticism, that £1 million is meaningless because the actual expenditure may be a sum substantially more than this. If £1 million is an approximation, how will that expenditure provide all the jobs for all the people looking for work in the Highlands which his party promised to find as a result of the Bill before the election?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To save my hon. Friend bobbing up and down too often, would he consider this point? In connection with grants and loans, what new approach, if any, will be made to that section of the Highland community who are designated either landowners or large farmers and who run parts of their estates or land as farms and use the other parts for hunting deer and charge the running expenses of the deer against their farming expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: King Charles's head!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will some new outlook be taken with regard to that section of the community?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that that arises on this Clause. We intend that the £1 million, or whatever the figure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 646</span>
may be by 1968–69, will be spent on developing the Highlands, not on depopulating the Highlands.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), asked me, if this figure had any meaning at all, how it would provide the jobs. It is not the only agency functioning in the Highlands. The Board of Trade will still function in the Highlands. B.O.T.A.C. funds will still be available in the Highlands. If a big project came forward which required special assistance, I have already indicated that such a project would probably have to be approved in a different manner. This is not the only manner. This is a Board which uses other organisations to the fullest possible extent for development. That is the answer to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a different tune from a few months ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a different tune at all. I was asked whether the expenditure under this Clause was included in the £1 million. The answer is that it is. If hon. Members opposite think that this is an inadequate sum, I remind them that they gave to the Highland Fund £150,000 over three years, which was roughly £50,000 a year. There is a vast difference between £50,000 and £1 million, even though the £1 million may be inadequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Against a general investment of £33 million a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The general investment of £33 million a year is still going on in the Highlands. All I am suggesting is that what we propose is a step forward. I am reminding the hon. Gentleman of the figures involved. I do not wish to be controversial about this. I have tried to conduct the Committee in a spirit of harmony. I have been most magnanimous, granting Amendments right, left and centre. My answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that it is included in that figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Within the limited sums available to the Board, how will the Board decide priorities as between local requests from within the area itself and requests for assistance for development in the area coming from persons or firms outside the area? For example,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0683">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 647</span>
if a number of requests came in together just now, within the £150,000 available for all purposes in the few months ahead to the end of this year how would the Board decide to arrange priorities? By what standard would the Board decide whether some request for help should be told to go to B.O.T.A.C. as not being within the Board's own province? How is the Board to decide where to give priority as between a request from outside the area and requests arising from within the area, perhaps affecting existing industries in the area?<br><br>
It is not quite clear to me how the Board is to administer the limited funds as between loan and grant aid. Naturally and admittedly all funds are limited. I am not clear how the Board is to operate within the sums which it is envisaged notionally at the moment it will have at its disposal. I can visualise a situation arising in which a fairly big request is made. For example, let us suppose that a project of the Fort William pulp mill type were proposed but that it was not really big enough to require legislation and that the Board also had a number of smaller local schemes for which claims were also being made and which were all of considerable local merit. When one is up against that sort of consideration, it comes hard down to a question of allocating within limited finance, as always.<br><br>
What guidance are the Government giving to the Board so that it will not be put into that almost impossible dilemma of having to decide to turn down a number of very valuable local schemes so as to finance a very large scheme or vice versa? This is the sort of thing the Board may well come up against at some stage. If it were said that £X million is to be a fixed sum out of which the Board must arrange its own priorities over a few years in making loans or grants, it would be a quite different position; but clearly, in regard to major schemes, other Government controls would operate and Government aid have to be provided additionally.<br><br>
I should like to have some sort of statement on the financing authority and general direction of the Board in relation to that situation. So much criticism has been made about the first half-year's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 648</span>
£150,000. It has been described generally as a miserable sum. No doubt my hon. Friend the Minister of State would like to say that to the Treasury, but he cannot very well say it in this Committee. No doubt he would also like to talk in terms of £10 million, rather than in terms of the estimated later £1 million. Whatever the sum, it is important that the Board should feel confident that it will not be placed in the dilemma of having to choose between local schemes of merit and schemes of merit from outside, perhaps, requiring very large sums of money. When then, does the Board have to refer a scheme to B.O.T.A.C? What sort of financial ceiling for Board-aid to projects is visualised? The sum of £1 million is thrown in in the Explanatory Memorandum. It is related very broadly, no doubt, to the current difficult economic situation, which we hope will not continue indefinitely.<br><br>
The Clause made everyone feel very optimistic, cheerful and hopeful about the Bill. Indeed, it is obviously intended to do so. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State has the intention, in bringing it forward, of seeing that it works—that its powers are used.<br><br>
May I for a moment take the example of a crofter with a grant and a loan for his house who is fully committed financially in the repayment of the loan over a large number of years. He is also responsible for the insurance of his house. He is also responsiblefor the maintenance of his house, as no council tenant is. He has all these things to do. He is completely committed financially. In the case of such a man, if he wants to do something more in relation to his croft—start some business or other enterprise—what security is he expected to provide?<br><br>
This will be one of the difficult matters with which the Board will have to deal under this Clause. Will there be some sort of character banking type of loan in the old sense of the term? Are new grants visualised right outside the present availability range of grants? This is an important matter. Let us assume that an enterprising crofter has built a very good house for himself and his family, as many crofters have, largely by their own labour, and has to repay a considerable sum of money over the years. If he wants to start up some little enterprise in the area of his croft, what is the Board to ask him
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0684">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 649</span>
to provide by way of security? He is fully committed already. Many crofters are. They are willing enough and enterprising enough, but because of the curse of lack of capital in the area and lack of sources of supply of longer term loan capital, crofters are very often left stranded, even when they have a good idea and are themselves enterprising men.<br><br>
People with promising ideas for development have often come to me and asked me about the Highland Fund, about local authority assistance, and about B.O.T.A.C. assistance. I have seen requests to all three sources turned down time and time again. Often, the local authority has not been able to do anything. The Highland Fund has not been able or prepared to do anything. B.O.T.A.C. has examined the projects—and turned them down. There is then just nowhere else to go. The banks can be approached, but certainly not by a crofter who is already saddled with a heavy house loan repayment and interest to the Department of Agriculture. Where does he go? On what terms will the Board be able to help him?<br><br>
One could similarly refer to small farming and to the difficulty experienced by young or middle-aged men who have had considerable skill and experience in farming. At the moment it is almost impossible to get the sort of assistance which enables a man to acquire a small farm. It is almost impossible for a person without considerable capital or considerable access to capital to lay his hands upon even a small farm. Letting is practically impossible.<br><br>
I suggest that the Board can here perform a function as important as, though outside its visualised industrial, commercial and other functions. Perhaps it should be equipped and encouraged to perform a function in providing opportunities for new farmers. It is very important that this should be done. At present, it is no use a man, however experienced and skilled he is in farming—he may be a farm manager, for example—going to a bank. In almost every case it is absolutely useless, unless he has some very special support behind him. That case would be exceptional and does not solve the general problem on its merits, in any case, even if he has. Will the Board be enabled to help in cases of that kind? We want skilled new entrants to farming, not simply hand farming over to people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 650</span>
who are merely able to provide the cash and bid highest, however unskilled.<br><br>
There is another point in connection with croft house building which I ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State to consider. To the extent that the housing grant is increased in respect of the crofter's new house, the loan needs to be less. In these days crofters face very high building costs in more remote areas, it being understood that when I use the word "remote" I am looking across the Minch from this side. It is a very different matter for a crofter to face the building of a house today than it was in 1954 or 1955 or even the date of the last grant increase. Costs in general have soared everywhere. Building costs are very much higher. If such men as these are prepared to be so enterprising, to a large extent with their own hands and skills, as to build homes for themselves, thus relieving local authorities and others of the responsibility of providing houses for them and their families, the time has surely come to face up realistically to the immensely increased building costs of today by increasing the building grants made to crofters, thereby at the same time reducing the burden of his loan and repayment liability.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
If the loan burden on the house were reduced, it would allow more flexibility to the Board and the Crofters Commission and the crofter himself in respect of further commitments and enterprises, proposed by the crofter. The need of the crofter to supplement the croft income by doing other jobs was visualised earlier by hon. Members on both sides. If the grant were increased realistically to meet the increased costs of building it would correspondingly reduce the amount of secured loan tied to the house and thereby enable the crofter with help from the Crofters' Commission and, I hope, the Board, to exercise more freedom in promoting a business or other undertaking.<br><br>
I put this forward as a serious proposition. Crofters are limited in what they can do through being fully and heavily committed to the repayment of loans because the grant is so small in relation to total building costs. These are practical questions which we come across every day in various aspects of our work as Highland and Island Members of Parliament. I do not seriously ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State to throw the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 651</span>
answer to the very general questions I asked when I started over his shoulder immediately, but certainly consideration of ways and means of deciding priority among claims for aid will come within the responsibility of the Board. These many competing claims already come within routine experience and the scope of the work of hon. Members who represent Highland constituencies.<br><br>
I hope that these are matters which the Minister will take an early opportunity to discuss with the Board when it is set up. I hope, meantime, that my hon. Friend will indicate whether now it may not be possible to relieve crofters in future of a great deal of the burden of loan repayments on a house by increasing the grant element to meet present day costs and to enable him to go ahead more easily with other commitments and developments which may require additional loans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have received representations from the Crofters Union for increasing the amount of building grant and loans available to the crofters. These representations are under consideration. There was an increase of £400 last year in the ceiling of the loan about which my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will be aware.<br><br>
Under the Clause the crofter is given some assistance in the light of difficulties experienced in the past. Because of the nature of crofting tenure, a crofter is not able to offer his house and other permanent improvements on his croft as security for a loan other than one made by the Secretary of State under the crofters' building grant or loan arrangements. This has proved troublesome in the case of the Treasury Loan Scheme. The Highland Fund encountered difficulties as regards security when lending money to crofters. But subsection (3) will enable the Board to obtain and the crofter to provide security over the contingent compensation value of the crofter's permanent improvements. The subsection is permissive.<br><br>
If the Board wishes or needs to obtain such security, it is required to give notice of the loan agreement both to the landlord of the croft and to the Secretary of State, and also to record the agreement in the crofter's holding book. After this has been done, if the crofter's resources are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 652</span>
fully committed, he is in no different position from a small farmer. I understand that the question of credit facilities for small farmers is under consideration.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles raised the question of the Board being placed in the position of having to make a choice between giving a number of small and essential grants to different enterprises throughout the Highlands or to one large enterprise. It would not happen like that. Under the arrangements which will be drawn up in accordance with subsection (1), the Board will be given power to make grants and loans up to a certain ceiling in respect of certain enterprises. Provision will be made in the Estimates to meet this expenditure each year. As time goes on no doubt the cost of this will be fairly well assessed.<br><br>
However, suppose that a larger project is suggested for the area and the Board wishes to make recommendations for its approval. There is nothing to prevent the Board from making recommendations to the Secretary of State. If he approves the proposals—and clearly if it involved large expenditure he would get the approval of the Treasury—the expenditure would have to be found over and above what the Board is spending because it would have been approved by the Secretary of State and by the Treasury and it would have to go into the Estimates, or other arrangements might have to be made according to the terms of the approval.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
Clause 9.—(ANCILLARY POWERS OF THK BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 5, line 43, to leave out from "charges" to "for" in line 44.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that we might take at the same time the next Amendment, No. 32, in page 5, line 44, at end insert "as they think fit".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read subsection 1<i>(a)</i> as it would read if the two Amendments were accepted:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall have power <i>(a)</i> to make such charges for any of their services as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 653</span>
It is going very far to say, as the paragraph does, that the Secretary of State shall have power to approve charges made by the Board for services provided under the Bill. I assume that this relates to the kind of services referred to in Clause 7, because that is the Clause which deals with services. If the Board, acting in its capacity as an adviser or in some other way, provided services, it should be left to the Board to decide what reasonable charges it should make. This is a question of emphasis: how much independence and freedom of action should this statutory body have? If it cannot even make charges for the services which it provides it has very little freedom of action.<br><br>
I do not wish unduly to detain the Committee with references to other examples of this kind of thing, but the wording of these two Amendments is to be found in the overseas development legislation, and I noticed that Section 3(6) of the Harbours Act, 1964, empowers the Council concerned to make charges in respect of the training and educational facilities which it provides. As far as I can see, there is no qualification in that Act requiring authorisation for these charges. It is sensibly left to the Council to make such charges as are appropriate. The Highland Development Board is perfectly capable of assessing the value of its services and should be free to make charges without recourse to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the view of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) about this matter, but we feel that there will be cases in which it is right and proper to charge a fee and that in such cases the Secretary of State's approval is necessary to ensure that the charges are not out of line with charges made by other boards and are consistent with general Government policy on this kind of matter.<br><br>
We have received representations about this matter expresing the fear that the Board might set about undercutting other enterprises in the Highlands. This was an added reason why we felt we should keep the Clause as it was. We take the view that the Secretary of State should retain this power. This does not mean to say that there might be some services which could be provided on a limited
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 654</span>
scale in respect of which it would be inappropriate or impracticable, or perhaps even uneconomic, to make charges. The Board would be free to do that in certain cases. But if it is to provide a certain service, the Secretary of State should have some say in the charges made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that the Board might set about undercutting other enterprises in the Highlands. Could he give us one or two examples of that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we should spend a great deal of time on this matter, but I am disappointed, not for the first time, and probably not for the last time, by the Minister of State. He continually assures us that the Board will be made up of able and brilliant people. Equally continually he suggests that the chairman of the Board will be in constant touch with the Secretary of State. Yet, on a matter of this sort, he is not prepared to give these able people, who will be in close touch with the Secretary of State, power to make their own charges.<br><br>
In the Minister's view, the charges made should not be out of line with charges made in other parts of the country. I do not agree. The Board may deliberately, as an act of policy, want to make charges which are out of line in the sort of cases to which I referred earlier. If the Secretary of State, with the aid and assistance of his Treasury friends, says, "A business consultancy would normally charge £4,000 for this and therefore you must charge £4,000", it will defeat the whole purpose of the Clause. What will happen if the Board, which, as the Minister keeps telling us, will be in close touch with the Secretary of State, is not allowed to charge the rate which it thinks proper for the use of the services which it offers? If it charges too much people will not use its services. If it charges too little, the local lawyer may say, "The Board is providing services at a cheaper rate than I charge".<br><br>
This is a small but important point and I think that the Committee should vote on it. If we do not allow a body to deal with minor matters like this, we may just as well abolish it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has said. If the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 655</span>
Minister of State had been sitting on this side of the Committee, I know how he would have opened his impassioned tirade against the sort of remarks which he has just made. He would have said, "Really, really"!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wrong intonation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet got the tone right. Constant practice will perhaps get it right.<br><br>
This is not a matter of enormous substance, but I should have thought it was one on which the Minister could have kicked over the traces and said that if the Board employs someone to advise it on, say, how to get more people to go to Scotland, it is not necessary, when the bill for five or ten guineas is sent in, for the Board to go to St. Andrew's House and say, "Is this all right? May we have your authority before we pay this comparatively minor sum from petty cash?". Is that really necessary?<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I am sure the Minister will agree with me. Is he to be tied hand and foot in this matter? Cannot he give even this small degree of independence to the Board. We agree that the Board ought to have an enormous amount of responsibility. It is a body of greater importance and with a bigger job to do than any I can remember. If it has to refer to St. Andrew's House in respect of a few pounds, shilling and pence its status will be lowered, and so I ask the Minister to give way on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to follow what has been said by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) about kicking over the traces because if I did I suppose that we should never get away from what has happened in the past 13 years, but I wonder whether the Minister could be a wee bit more forthcoming. When he talks about not wanting to step out of line with services which may be provided by other Government Departments, what kind of services is he talking about? What Departments give the services envisaged here—advisory services, for instance—which presumably are not available at the moment and for which we are making provision in this unique Bill? He has not said any-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 656</span>
thing which has convinced me that it would be wrong to leave these comparatively minor services in the hands of the Board.<br><br>
Who is complaining? Is it accountants or the personnel management firms who at present give services on a strictly commercial basis and who are frightened that there will be available to the community some service—to which, I understand, there would be no opposition by hon. Members opposite, if that were to be the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and I hope that we shall go to a vote. Either we are to trust the Board, or not. If it has to refer every fiddling little thing like these to St. Andrew's House the number of civil servants there will have to be increased drastically. Already, since this Government have been in power, there are 127 more, and we do not want any more. So I hope we vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave the reasons why we think we ought to keep these powers in the Bill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why should not the Minister change his mind? It is quite easy. He just has to say, "Yes".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should not hurry me. Let me do it in my own way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave the reasons why we put these words in the Clause and why we think we should keep them in. There are arguments for keeping them in. There are quite a lot of services in which the Government have a say about prices charged, so that the principle is not new. Having listened to the arguments I think that I am prepared to accept the Amendment—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]—I hope—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not hedge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of hedging. I have said that I intend to accept the Amendment and I will accept it. I was only about to express regret that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) will not get his vote.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendment made:</i> In page 5, line 44, at end insert "as they think fit." <i>—[Mr. Wylie.]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 7, to leave out subsection (2) and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) For the purpose of the exercise of any of their functions the Board may, with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, borrow money.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be convenient if, with this Amendment No. 91, we also discuss the two Amendments to the Amendment in the name of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). After "may" insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the subsequent provisions of this section".</p></blockquote>
At end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(3) The power of the Board to borrow shall be exercisable only with the approval of the Secretary of State and of the Treasury, as to the amount, the source and the terms on which the borrowing may be effected, and any approval so given may be either general or limited to a particular borrowing, and may be either unconditional or subject to conditions.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) For the purpose of enabling the Board to defray expenditure properly chargeable to capital account, including defraying initial expenses and the provision of working capital, the Secretary of State shall, with the consent of the Treasury, make advances to the Board up to amounts, such that the aggregate amount in any one financial year shall not exceed ten million pounds.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) The Secretary of State may, with the consent of the Treasury, guarantee, in such manner and on such conditions as they think fit, the repayment of the principal of and the payment of interest and the charges on any authorised borrowings of the Board made otherwise than by way of advance made under the preceding subsection.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Immediately after any advance is made, or any guarantee is given, under this section the Treasury shall lay a statement thereof before Parliament.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My Amendment is designed to tidy up the Bill and make clearer what is said by subsection (2). The power to borrow money is implicit in the provisions of subsection 1<i>(d),</i> but we thought that we would spell it out more clearly, which is what we intend by the proposed new subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The wording which the Minister has introduced in the Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
ment is preferable to that in the subsection (2) as at present drafted. One of the earliest criticisms of the Bill was that it seemed clear the Government did not intend or wish, that the Board should borrow money. It was put in an entirely negative way in the existing words. Subsection (2) says that the Board will not have power to borrow money unless the Secretary of State says it can do so. This Amendment is an advance on that, in that it says that the Board can borrow money, provided it gets consent to do so.<br><br>
I say, with respect, that it does not go nearly far enough to have a broad power to borrow money—subject to the necessary consent, about which I accept the need. It seems to me that is not really sufficient, if the Board is to function in the way we all hope. Not only will it require funds from the Secretary of State but also powers to borrow money which it can exercise. Examples of this power which I have been able to find elaborate it substantially, and figures have been mentioned.<br><br>
In the Amendments to the Amendment we attempt to specify in greater detail the power to borrow and how it may be exercised. I refer to the proposed new Clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6 in this connection. We begin with the provision that the Board can borrow money and we go on to suggest that we should further provide that the power to borrow should be
<br><blockquote><p>"exercisable only with the approval of the Secretary of State and of the Treasury, as to the amount, the source and the terms on which the borrowing may be effected, and any approval so given may be either general or limited to a particular borrowing, and may be either unconditional or subject to conditions."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that it is not enough to say that the Board can borrow money. In the public interest, as well as that of the Board, it is necessary to go further and specify the circumstances under which this can be done. Clause 3 is an attempt to specify—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that for1 the purposes of accuracy of the record the hon. and learned Gentleman should refer to "subsections" rather than to new Clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry, Mr. Steele.<br><br>
Subsection (3) is an attempt to elaborate the general proposition about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 659</span>
borrowing money. In legislation of this nature I think it desirable to be more specific than simply leaving it as broadly stated as at present.<br><br>
Subsection (4) goes on to provide—I think this is equally important—that
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of enabling the Board to defray expenditure properly chargeable … the Secretary of State shall, with the consent of the Treasury, make advances to the Board"—</p></blockquote>
for specified amounts. I accept that in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum there is provision for this type of thing to be done, but I think the Bill would be improved if there were in it a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to provide funds. Others more qualified will speak on the figure mentioned, but I think it desirable that there should be built into the legislation a statutory obligation on the part of the Secretary of State to make advances on these lines.<br><br>
In addition to the question of borrowing power there is the associated question of the need to guarantee loans. That provision is to be found in subsection (5), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, with the consent of the Treasury, guarantee, in such manner and on such conditions as they think fit, the repayment of the principal of and the payment of interest and the charges on any authorised borrowings …"</p></blockquote>
That is an attempt to make it possible, in effect, for the Board to exercise its borrowing powers. If the Board goes to some lending authority it may not be able to obtain the necessary loan unless it has the backing of the Secretary of State who will act as a guarantor for the borrowing. I think it would strengthen the borrowing position of the Board if such a subsection were incorporated into the Bill.<br><br>
The final subsection accepts that Parliament must be informed of all that is going on. If a statutory body is given power to borrow, and borrows from one source or another, on one set of conditions or another, it is desirable that Parliament should know what is going on. I do not think it is enough that this should simply be the subject matter of the annual Report which is provided for in the Bill. By the time the annual report appears the borrowing has been completed. Although this is a matter on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
which there will be some argument, I suggest it would be desirable that a statement of borrowings should be laid before Parliament other than that which appears in the annual statement.<br><br>
I said that usually one finds greater elaboration where statutory bodies are given these borrowing powers and I press this Amendment to make quite clear it is the intention of the Committee that the Board should have positive powers, and it is envisaged that these powers should be exercised. My initial complaint about the wording of subsection (2) was that it was in a negative fashion and nobody suggested that he wanted the Board to borrow money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister's Amendment would alter the emphasis in the right direction, I submit that it would be desirable to have a detailed provision making perfectly clear that it is envisaged without doubt that not only will the Board have borrowing powers, but it will be able to exercise them.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
There is nothing unusual about this kind of thing. As I have already indicated, the provisions which I have mentioned are precedented, as the Minister will be aware, in the Colonial Development Act. There are other examples. To take the most recent of them, in Section 5 in the Industrial Training Act of last year there are detailed provisions with regard to grants and loans. Section 5(1) of that Act provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may with the approval of the Treasury make grants and loans …".</p></blockquote>
Later it specifies the aggregate amount in any one year, and states that it must not exceed £50 million, and there are detailed provisions about security for loans, and so on. Another example, to take last year's statutes, is the Harbours Act, 1964, which, again, builds into the legislation very detailed provisions in regard to advances and loans under Sections 11, 12 and 13.<br><br>
If it is envisaged that the general borrowing powers we are considering will be exercised, then I suggest that we must build into the legislation detailed provisions as to the manner, extent and amount of the borrowing which may be exercised and we should leave in no doubt the fact that the Government intend that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
the Board shall be able to borrow and envisage that it may do so in order to carry out the functions which all hon. Members are anxious to see performed. I therefore beg to move—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I direct the attention of the Committee—although I appreciate that I may be reading the various Amendments incorrectly—to what appears to be some rather unnecessary wording in the Amendments to the Amendment. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) wants to insert words after "may" in the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Minister of State. Would it not be necessary, to make clear the hon. and learned Gentleman's Amendment to the Amendment, to omit the words in my hon. Friend's Amendment
<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury"?</p></blockquote>
This is a technical point but it would seem that unless that were done the subsection would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of the exercise of any of their functions the Board may, subject to the subsequent provisions of this Section, with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, borrow …".</p></blockquote>
Since in the further Amendment to the Amendment the hon. and learned Gentleman refers, in Subsection (3), to
<br><blockquote><p>"… with the approval of the Secretary of State and of the Treasury …"</p></blockquote>
there would appear to be a phrase in the original Amendment which needs to be deleted to make the hon. and learned Gentleman's Amendments to the Amendment read properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is essential to have the proviso in the Minister's Amendment about the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury to borrow money. That gives a general consent to borrow money, but it must be exercised only with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury. I suggest that that must be left in. It may be argued that it is not necessary, since one is qualifying a general power and since in subsection (3) of the Second Amendment to the Amendment there is another reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State and of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
That is a matter on which, no doubt, the Minister will have the advice of his Parliamentary draftsmen. I am very conscious of the need to tie up borrowing powers with Treasury consent, and while I may be erring on the safe side by the use of these words, they make it abundantly clear that the powers can be exercised only with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important Amendment because it deals with the financing of the Board. We gave a great deal of thought to this matter in the preparation of the Bill when we were deciding how best it should be financed.<br><br>
The purpose of the Amendment to the Amendment is to enable the Board to finance its operations first by way of advances by the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, towards the defrayal of expenditure chargeable to capital account—including initial expenses and the provision of working capital—such advances not to exceed, in aggregate, £10 million in any one year, and, secondly by borrowing on terms to be approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury—the Secretary of State with the consent of the Treasury having power to guarantee, on such condition as they consider fit, the repayment of principal and payment of interest. It also provides that immediately any advance is made, or guarantee given, the Treasury shall lay a statement of it before Parliament.<br><br>
It is not clear whether hon. Gentlemen opposite have it in mind that the proposed new subsections should also supersede the provision in Clause 16(1), which provides for the payment by the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, of all the Board's expenses. They have not, however, put down any Amendment to Clause 16, and they presumably have it in mind that the Board's administrative expenses and expenditures, other than on capital account and so far as not borrowed from outside sources, should be defrayed by grant under Clause 16(1).<br><br>
The method of financing provided for in the Amendment to the Amendment is, as the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) said, not unusual in the case of nationalised concerns and statutory boards and it was, in fact, given some consideration
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
when the Bill was being drafted because we recognised the importance of this matter. We think it essential that the means of financing should be such as to provide adequate financing, expeditious financing and flexible financing. The Board should be able to plan ahead and properly approved proposals should not be delayed through any defect, either in the manner or in the amount of finance to be provided. These are the principles underlying whatever scheme one adopts.<br><br>
It is inevitable that the bulk of the Board's operations will be of a pioneering, promotional and "development" nature and, therefore, not of a type in which a profit or full return can be expected; that is, so far as the Board itself will be concerned. Indeed some of the Board's activities will be of a social nature and not revenue-producing at all in the strict sense of the word.<br><br>
Moreover, proposals by the Board for development will be submitted by the Board to the Secretary of State for approval and once these proposals have been approved by him there will be a consequent obligation to provide the money for their implementation. The Board, therefore, should be able to secure the money necessary for such developments in the ordinary course of grant-in-aid financing, and the provision of a special apparatus of borrowing, such as is proposed in the Amendment to the Amendment is both inappropriate and unnecessary.<br><br>
It is not, however, proposed completely to exclude borrowing by the Board. We have in mind particularly that it may have to make temporary borrowings by way of bank overdraft to meet day to day requirements. The Clause thus permits borrowing, but only with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury. To that extent there would, in any event, be no need for subsection (3) of the Amendment to the Amendment, this being covered already by Clause 9; that is, by subsection (1,<i>(d)</i>) and subsection (2) in their present form, or by subsection (2) in its amended form.<br><br>
It will be seen, as a result of this, that what we have in mind is financing by grant in aid and not by borrowing and we think it important that this principle should be adhered to. Hon. Gentlemen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
opposite have, in their Amendment to the Amendment, suggested that borrowing should be permissible up to £10 million, but, of course, any figure mentioned here would be an estimate, as was pointed out when we dealt with the figure of £1 million in regard to the Financial Memorandum. It does not mean a lot unless it is related to particular services. The vital point—and this is why we need not concentrate on any specific amount—is to ensure that the money provided for the Board is additional to the normal range of Government and public expenditures in the Highlands and Islands and to ensure that this additional money is constructively applied to secure the fullest results.<br><br>
Assurances have been given by Ministers that the figures quoted in the Explanatory Memorandum are estimates of what, looking to the conditions in the first year or two of the Board's existence, the Board might be expected to need. If the Board applies itself to its tasks energetically and brings forward worthwhile schemes, then, as I said previously, these sums could quite well be exceeded.<br><br>
I do not think, therefore, that there would be any prospect of there being a difference in the spending of the Board. The important question is whether we should meet the expenditure by borrowing or by grant in aid. We have come down on the side of the grant in aid because of the fact that such a great part of the Board's activities will not be suitable for financing by way of loan. They are not activities which can be measured in the normal terms of profitability. They are of a different character—social, promotional and so on—and for these reasons I must advise the Committee to reject the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be right when he says that a great deal of the operations of the Board will be of a promotional and development type, but I was a little worried when, in our discussion of an earlier Amendment, the hon. Gentleman kept saying that if we had another operation like the pulp mill we should need new legislation. My hon. Friends and I hoped that if this type of wording were accepted it would provide the Board with the means—I know that these things cannot go up every year; but they may perhaps go up once every five, ten or 15 years—which would at least avoid the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 665</span>
business of having to argue the whole problem on the Floor of the House, and waste time and effort, when so often these big things are only available if they are caught at once. If an opportunity is missed such things may go to Northern Ireland or elsewhere. The Minister should explain why it is that this type of operation, on the rare occasions when it comes up, could not be met by the Board, having the sort of powers my hon. and learned Friend has suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed at the answer of the Minister. I thought that the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) put forward an extremely reasonable and well reasoned case. I hope, following the remarks of the right hon. Member for</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
<p>Argyll (Mr. Noble), that the Minister will consider this discretionary point again. The main reason why, apparently, he cannot accept the Amendment to the Amendment is that the Board may borrow money. Although he feels that this is necessary to meet its short-term requirements, he apparently feels that the larger matters should be met not by way of loan but by way of grant in aid. This is not an argument which particularly appeals to me, and it seems that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—</p>
