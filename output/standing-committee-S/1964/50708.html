	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any discussion on education could go on for a very long time and I admit that, like every other Member on this side of the Committee, I could speak for the rest of the morning. However, I can reassure the Committee at the outset by saying that I shall do no such thing. It is fortunate that we agreed to concentrate, this morning, on the very important aspect of education, of the preparations necessary for the raising of the school leaving age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be within the recollection of the Committee that on 17th March and 19th March, 1964, this Committee discussed, at some length, the contents of the Brunton Report, which is very relevant to our discussion this morning. At that time I seem to recall that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. William Hannan), who I am glad to see has just arrived, made a powerful, but rather party-biased, speech. It is not my intention to follow his example, much as I respect his views in other matters. I do not intend to introduce party politics into this discussion at all, because I believe that the introduction of party politics into educational matters makes very little contribution to educational progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of myself, and most people, the record of the past years has been one of steady progress. In support of that, I would instance the comment made in the impartial and soberly-worded report of the Scottish Education Committee for 1964. This has a very definite effect upon the setting for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
raising of the school-leaving age. In the year 1964 there were major developments in Scottish education which contributed towards that setting. If I may stray for a brief sentence outside the limits of this discussion, the major development was the introduction of a new university in Stirling, in my home town. I hope that I may, on behalf of the whole Committee, add our very best wishes to the newly-appointed principal, Professor Cottrell. I know that the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) would wish to subscribe to these good wishes and we in turn would like to send him our good wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new university, the establishment of a General Teaching Council, and the announcement of the forthcoming raising of the school leaving age, to be effective in 1970, were probably the three most important advances in Scottish education for a long time. We have to consider this morning what the immediate requirements are for the raising of the school-leaving age. We must first of all have adequate buildings. Secondly, the curricula should be planned to ensure that the maximum value from the extra year is gained by both the pupil and the nation, because the pupil's contribution is ultimately one which the nation can ill afford to lose. There is, finally, the problem of teacher shortage, and the consideration of such measures as have already been taken, or may be required, in order to get a greater number of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us who are educational enthusiasts to some extent look forward to progress, such as the raising of the school-leaving age, and accept it because it is necessary and important. There are, I think, some doubts in the country as a whole as to the wisdom of this step. Criticism will be made, either now or at a later stage, by teachers upon whom a heavy burden will be thrown, as shortages will continue, and by pupils to whom the lure of a wage packet is very great, despite the fact that the wage packet may remain for many years at the same level. Parents also do not always appreciate, as much as we should like them to, the advantages to be gained from their children remaining at school. We cannot dismiss a hungry labour market which is already in existence in many parts of England, and which we sincerely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
hope will be in existence in Scotland in the very near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Brunton Report places a very wise emphasis on the need for raising the school-leaving age. I will quote from paragraph 21 on page 12 of that Report which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No matter how well the schools may perform their task, boys and girls who leave school at the age of 15 are not fully-developed, intellectually, emotionally, socially or physically; nor can their further development be safely left to chance … It is important that their education should continue on a broad front."</p></blockquote>
The argument leading up to that is, in my view, very cogent and wise. The success of implementing the raising of the school-leaving age depends upon the fulfilment of the requirements which I have instanced. There is first the question of adequate buildings. It is true that the S.E.D. 1964 Report speaks of the good progress in this respect. A total of £43 million has been spent on Scottish schools last year, and this is a very considerable sum of money. This sum has increased steadily over the years. The result has been that we have more than half the children in Scotland today studying in schools built during the post-war period. That is a tremendous achievement and one which is frequently under-estimated, but it is not enough because there is an additional point in relation to school buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If additional education is to be successful, then it is important to remember that classes must be smaller and certainly not larger. We are committed to a policy whereby we are going to keep a greater number of children a further year at school. I had personal experience of the last raising of the school age, at a local authority level, where, despite a very remarkable degree of foresight and effort on the part of the director of education and others, the difficulties were very great indeed. I see some of those difficulties only too clearly, but I do not want to go into them in detail at this stage. I hope that such preparations as we are now making will avoid at least a certain number of such difficulties. In our building programme we should remember the need for smaller classes and work towards that end. This is something which is often left till last on a long list of so-called priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
So far as the curriculum is concerned, there are a number of questions to be raised. I remember having some brisk words with the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Tam Dalyell) on the proportion of pupils to be attracted in one form or another. Today I am clear that the people with whom we are most concerned are those who are the less gifted academically. There has been a division whereby approximately 35 per cent. of our school children take some form of academic education and are able to cope with it, but there are 65 per cent. who benefit from education in the schools, and only in the schools. Those who will be added to the number, by the raising of the school-leaving age, will, for obvious reasons be, in the main, those who are less well-qualified to follow a purely academic course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady agree that on the occasion to which she referred I was merely stating that while everyone here was concerned with the average pupil, the very gifted pupils also have rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I have far fewer fears about the rights of the very gifted than I have for the rest. I have always held this opinion, and I do not intend to be shifted from it. The exceptions will be the late developers, to whom the lure of the wage packet is strong and who are not over-eager to work extra hard and extra long. For the majority we should wonder whether the present curriculum follows too closely a recognised academic pattern. I think that the hon. Lady, the Under-Secretary of State, will understand the point I am making here. By and large, the schools have long been geared to the possibility of taking some form of certificate course whereas now, in my view, we should pay more attention to those who are, quite clearly, not going to take a certificate course, and who need a wider selection of informal education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much informal education should there be? This is a difficult decision and one to which I hope the educational experts are paying a good deal of attention. Should examinations for these pupils be changed in form or should they exist at all? I think that there is a good argument on both sides. Certainly I think there is an argument for having less
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
academic examination and more individual examination, although I am aware that this places an additional burden on the teachers. In all this the most important section of the community must be those who are going to become the unskilled and semi-skilled workers. In a time when leisure is increasing I should have thought that one of the things to which we must look forward is getting these people to do something. In an age when automation is progressing it is essential that people who are not academically inclined, but who are not necessarily content to listen to others, should be given an incentive to do something themselves rather than to watch or listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can remember many impassioned pleas for greater use of music both in teaching and as an outlet for expression in the schools. These were all made by a very prominent educationist in his day. He is happily still alive, at the age of 90, I believe. He is the Rev. J. M. Munro, the brother-in-law of the late James Maxton. Almost alone in his day, the Rev. Munro argued the case for teaching through music. I am coming shortly to the question of Chapter VI teachers, which is why I am making this special reference, because a wide contribution can be made in this field in respect of music, woodwork, embroidery, and whatever occupations can be followed after school days in the form of active work as opposed to listening or watching somebody else working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one reference—which I hope the hon. Lady will take up—in connection with curricula, namely, the necessity of studying the problems which have arisen in the four-year schools. I do not want to detain the Committee by going into detail, but those who have watched this development with some interest are aware of the problems which have been created. It seems to me that in the four-year schools difficulties arise for the teachers where education leading to a certificate has to be given to some pupils while, at the same time, others are not going forward for that certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the dilemma of the teacher. It is one which the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) and I recognise, except that in the teacher's case the problem must be resolved by the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
person. Here we are able to adopt our own points of view, but the teacher must strike a balance, and I am not sure that at this stage of development in the four-year courses this balance has been reached. It is important to get the evidence and advice of those who are practising themselves, because it will be relevant to the set-up in certain classes of school when the school-leaving age is raised. The whole system of concentration on examination entrants arises here, together with the alternative of increasing the informal education to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, but by no means least, there is the shortage of teachers. Hon. Members opposite must not be lured into party politics in this respect, because this above all things ought not to be considered in those terms. The present position is that teacher recruitment is running at a record level. It may not be enough; indeed, we all agree that it is not. As hon. Members, know, many teachers leave the profession. It is strange, but true. It is therefore satisfactory to know that more teachers are coming along. It is particularly satisfactory that more than half the graduates in the arts and pure science are entering the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a phrase in the Brunton Report which sets me thinking. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have evidence which suggests that much can be achieved by redeployment of the the existing staffing resources within schools".</p></blockquote>
Some have experience of this, but others have not thought about it. Certain redeployments of teachers are becoming increasingly acceptable to most people who are interested in education and in the profession itself. Among the first of these is the suggestion that it might be possible to employ auxiliaries much more rapidly than hitherto. This proposal has the approval of the E.I.S.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Robbins Report recommends a B.Ed. degree. I hope that the Minister will refer to this, although I confess that my enthusiasm for it is fairly dim. I require a good deal of convincing that there would be a speedy return from the implementation of this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I come to the question of married teachers. I hope that I can put forward a point of view which is very relevant but which is seldom considered seriously, and which I am sure will appeal to the hon. Lady as it appeals to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
There is growing evidence that one of the difficulties in the recruitment of married teachers arises from the very unsatisfactory tax position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week the working party of a body of professional women not confined to any one profession but including representatives from the councils of almost every profession in England, provided evidence that suggested that there was a tremendous loss to the teaching profession of married women who were prepared to come back but who were inhibited from doing so because the tax laws did not enable them to be left with sufficient reward to employ someone in their place while they taught and, at the same time, obtain some modest reward. It put the number at over 10,000. That working party is still in the very early stages of its inquiry, but this is a formidable figure. Even if it were only one-tenth of that figure, surely we should examine much more closely, in the national interest, the tax position as it affects married women teachers who have left the profession and who might be persuaded to return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Lady answer the Treasury Ministers on both sides of the House who have said to those who have made suggestions of the kind which she has just made, "Are we to make concessions to every family and to every woman who has a job?" From a Treasury point of view is not that exceedingly difficult?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to return to the Finance Bill so early in the morning. I left it not many hours ago, and I am sure that you, Mr. McInnes, would prefer that I did not refer to it. I am prepared to argue the point with the hon. Member when the Committee rises. There is a case for examining this question, and there can be no harm in considering it. There is cause for believing that the tax question does have some effect on the recruitment of married teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the last two recommendations concerning teachers. It is with some pleasure that I draw attention to a very important minority report of which the E.I.S. is well aware, and which is familiar to me. I notice that in that minority report I recommended two
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
things. It was eight years ago, but I stand by those two recommendations. They were, first, that in certain circumstances non-graduate men should be included in the profession in Scotland. It is no use all the graduate men opposite rising and looking anxious; this has been argued closely as being a correct decision, as has my second recommendation, namely, that there should be special provision for Chapter VI teaching, and that there are persons who could qualify under Chapter VI outwith the possibilities at present open to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are some of the thoughts that have gone through my mind in considering this important matter. The profession as a whole is greatly strengthened by the formation of the General Teaching Council, which will look after its interests. Doubtless some work has been done on this since the circular was sent out to education authorities by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) when he was Secretary of State. What we want to know now is what the Government are doing about the preparation for this very important step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seem to have been in this Committee for a very long time, listening to hon. Members opposite asking what was being done. Much was done by the previous Administration, and it was done steadily. Then the great new world came upon us. We were told that we were going to have a great new revolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not be lured into questions of Party Politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to mention Party Politics. But we were told that we were going to see a revolution which, among other things, would benefit the teaching profession. We are still waiting to hear about this. This is the first opportunity, so I hope that the hon. Lady will give us a full account of the great strides forward which will be made in respect of the preparations now going on in her Ministry far the raising of the school-leaving age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Cullen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Lady agree that tax concessions are not all that is preventing married women from re-entering the profession? Does not she agree that we require more nursery schools, so that married women can leave their children in them, knowing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
that they will be looked after while their mothers are teaching? Does she not agree that many more women would come back to the profession if more nursery schools were provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson). We have all been delighted to see her on the Front Bench this morning. I hope that we shall have other opportunities of doing so. I welcomed the tone of her speech, up to the last few words, and gladly respond to it. I shall try hard not to respond to the tone in her last paragraph, although I was ready, in case she should emerge with a highly party political speech. I am glad that she has not, because this is a subject on which there is a great deal to say. We can have party politics, too, but first let us discuss what is being done and what needs to be done. I very much welcome the opportunity of giving what will, in effect, be a sort of stocktaking report. I shall have something to say about most of the points which the hon. Lady raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I propose to say something about the general approach to the problems involved in raising the school-leaving age. Then I want to deal with an aspect of fundamental concern—the problem of the supply of teachers—and then to look at the contents of education in the secondary period and the reorganisation of secondary education. Lastly, I shall deal with the problems of accommodation which will be involved in meeting the needs of the children who will be staying on in 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been part of our thinking that the period of compulsory education should be extended to the age of 16 at the earliest practicable date. We have always regarded it as right that our young people should have the fullest opportunity of taking their secondary education as far as possible. We could not be satisfied with a system in which a secondary education lasting four years or more was the right only of a relatively small number of children, often—though I emphasise not always—socially selected,
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
in the sense that in our society we tend to find that there is a close relationship between opportunity and social and economic background. We have always believed that an extension of the period of compulsory education was very much in the country's interest. Clearly it is. Every step forward our country has ever taken technologically and socially has been marked by an extension of the period of compulsory education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I do not know that I would necessarily say that 1970–71 is the ideal time to set for this change. Obviously there will be a lot of difficulties. But, unless a date is set for a reform of this kind, it is all too easy to allow difficulties to postpone action. So we are basing our planning, clearly, on the raising of the age in the session 1970–71. I would emphasise one thing, and that is that we need to keep the change in the leaving age in perspective, and we need to see it in terms that are not too dramatic, because children very often tend to stay on at school beyond the present leaving age, and we expect this to develop further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1955, over the country as a whole, only 10·3 per cent. of children attending public schools who three years earlier were aged 13 were still at school. By 1964, that proportion had risen to 19·4 per cent.—almost double. But although the effect of this trend by 1970 will be to make the raising of the leaving age a somewhat less clear-cut and dramatic change than might have been the case, it is obvious that we are here dealing with a fundamental issue, and it is one which presents a number of major difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Government, it is our responsibility to put the education authorities in a position, so far as it is humanly possible, to meet the 1970 situation. The responsibilities they have are very heavy, in gearing up the schools to provide the right kinds of courses in secondary education, in making more school accommodation available, and in trying to bring about what the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East referred to as the most effective deployment of the teaching staffs that they have. The whole problem must be approached as one demanding the very fullest co-operative effort, and in this I believe that the teachers' organisations have a very substantial part to play. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
education service has some five years in which to carry its preparations forward. This may seen a fairly long period, but it is quite clear that it is going to allow little enough time for all that will have to be done, and if we are to be successful, all those who have some part of the responsibility for the education service will have to be ready to adopt an approach which is both flexible and imaginative, and we shall need to use all our resources of ingenuity in making sure we make the best use of accommodation and facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was estimated last year that in Scotland as a whole the number of pupils who, but for the raising of the leaving age, would have ceased full-time education and for whom, therefore, additional facilities would have to be provided by 1970–71 would be about 52,000. This was based on the expectation that the age group that is first involved would total some 82,000, that some 20,000 would in any case be remaining at school because they wanted to, and that about 10,000 would be moving into full-time further education at the age of 15. Over and above these, there would be an increasing number of pupils who, as a result of the raising of the leaving age, would stay on at school voluntarily beyond the age of 16.

Education authorities were asked a year ago to make a study of the additional number of pupils for whom they would need to provide, and in April of this year most of the authorities had submitted their estimates of the numbers concerned. Obviously the estimates are slightly provisional at this stage but, on the whole, they bear out the estimates made last year, except perhaps that for a variety of reasons the use that we can expect to be made of further education may be rather less than was thought last year. There are a number of demands in other directions on the facilities of further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having sketched in the background and our general approach, I turn now to the problem of teacher supply. What is the position likely to be in 1970–71, when the leaving age is raised? My right hon. Friend and I have given a good many figures bearing on this on previous occasions, but it is important that the position should be clearly understood. In October last it was estimated by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
education authorities that they needed some 3,600 teachers to fill vacancies, to replace uncertificated teachers and retired teachers over the age of 70. On the forecasts made by the Robbins Committee concerning the increasing numbers likely to be coming into higher education, the position is likely to improve over the next few years. But, with the raising of the leaving age in 1970–71, we are likely to be short of some 4,000 to 5,000 teachers in that year. In other words, we can expect to have a shortage rather greater than the one we have this session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These figures are on the basis of the maximum class sizes as they are at present prescribed. As a Government, we do not regard it is exceptional that we should for any indefinite period postpone a reduction of these prescribed maxima. This will mean that, as soon as possible, we want even more teachers to reduce the class size, as well as raising the school leaving age in 1970–71. Obviously we shall have to be governed by how successful we are in attracting teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no one single solution to the problem of teacher supply. What we have to do is to take every practicable step to stimulate recruitment to teaching still further. Let us look at this, as it were, in categories. The number of graduates admitted to teacher training in recent years has been more than 1,000 a year. We shall try to do even better than this. But, although the numbers of graduates entering teacher training are likely to increase as higher education expands, it is doubtful whether we can reasonably expect a significant increase in the proportion of the total output of graduates who come into teaching. As the hon. Lady herself pointed out, at the moment a little over 50 per cent. of the output of the Scottish universities in arts and pure science already come into teaching. We have to recognise that there are a number of other legitimate claims in industry and other professions with which we have to reckon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple fact is that not every one wants to teach, and we just have to accept that that is so. But we have been stepping up our efforts to persuade far more graduates to choose teaching. Our teams have been in the universities, alongside industrial firms, doing a very persuasive job. In so far as it is possible to attract more graduates into teaching,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
we shall spare no effort to do so, but we should not imagine that these efforts will result in a situation which will make any appreciable contribution to solving the teacher shortage in 1970–71.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two areas in which we have concentrated a great deal of energy this year. One was not a new one—a campaign to encourage married women teachers to come back to teaching. The odd thing about the point the hon. Lady raised, which I mention as an illustration of the quirks of the House, is that for years I was putting down Parliamentary questions to the right hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends about the taxing of women, entering teaching. Now she is putting questions to me. I can only say to her that this is not a matter which comes within the responsibilities of the Scottish Office, but it is something at which we shall be looking very closely and, if anything can be done, we shall do it. However, there are substantial arguments against as well as for, and there are grounds for believing that the case put forward by the professional women's organisations, although it has some substance, perhaps has not quite as much substance as they believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible at this stage to measure the effect that our campaign to encourage more married teachers to return to teaching has had, for although a number of them have written to me and explained some of the problems standing in their way—and we have sometimes been able to help—it is normally to the Director of Education that they make their approach. I hope that we have, in our campaign, reinforced these efforts. I am certain that in the next few years we shall see more and more married women choosing to return to teaching as their own children grow older.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen) mentioned provision for the children of married teachers. As hon. Members know, we have done something about them. We are encouraging education authorities to provide nursery schools specifically for the children of married women teachers. At present, married women teachers amount to something like a quarter of our total teaching strength, and I am certain that this figure will go up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
The other area of our attack was the Special Recruitment Scheme for teachers which was begun by the Labour Government in 1951. But there has never, until this year been such a big publicity campaign as the one we launched in the spring. I see the Special Recruitment Scheme as having two equally important functions: to bring into teaching mature people with wide experience who can make a real contribution, particularly in teaching many of the children we are talking about this morning who will be staying on at school a year longer in 1970; and to give a second chance to those who did not have a higher education and now regret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our publicity campaign has so far brought forward—and I give today's total figure—10,215 inquiries. It is impossible at this stage to say how many inquiries will be translated into accepted applications for training—I might mention here that the rate of success in completing training seems much the same as that of younger men and women who enter straight from school—but the present indications are at least encouraging. I cannot give the Committee figures, but I can say that even a 5 per cent. yield, which is a very low figure, on the number of inquiries we have so far had would give us some 500 teachers. More will be a welcome bonus, and it may perhaps be more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are reasonably confident that the demand for places for training can be met. A big expansion of the colleges of education is going on now. I will go into detail on this point, but if any hon. Member would like further information, it can be made available later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has before him recommendations put to him by the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers, endorsed by the education authorities, for the introduction of a four-year College of Education Associateship course. There is also the proposal which has emerged elsewhere for the admission of men to the three-year diploma course for primary school teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any new proposal for the training of teachers, there are two aspects to be considered very carefully indeed. One is the contribution it is likely to make to our total output of teachers. Any slight widening of the net of recruitment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
would be likely to result in a greater total output of teachers. Both the Associateship and the admission of men to the three-year diploma course would be likely to do this. The other aspect is the relationship of the nature of teacher training to the demands placed upon the teacher in a pattern of education which is rapidly changing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New concepts are emerging of the rôle of the educator and of the objectives he is trying to achieve. Teaching a seven-year-old, teaching an academically gifted 14-year-old and teaching a 14-year-old whose bent is practical and non-academic all make their own different demands on teaching methods and teaching skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principals of the colleges of education feel that the associateship course would be of particular value in providing a broadly-based training of great relevance to both secondary and primary schools; and it can also be argued that the admission of men to the three-year diploma course would have great advantages. We need more men in the primary schools and, in some ways, the three-year course, which is concerned with professional training throughout, may be better than one year of professional training on top of an ordinary university degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is another area of opinion to be considered, that of the teaching profession itself, which, from time to time—indeed, almost continuously in the last few months—has been expressing its views. I welcome the fact. For this is not just a matter of professional standards; it involves the acceptance of social responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make my right hon. Friend's and my own views quite clear. We have looked very closely at all the suggestions made by the profession for increasing recruitment. There is not one that we have not examined very carefully. On a number of them we have taken action. Where we have not yet been able to follow up some suggestion made, for example, by the E.I.S., it is because the difficulties of doing so are just too great. I hope the profession will accept this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
Despite all we have done, we are concerned about the position that will face us in 1970, and in the years following 1970. We shall need, as I have said, something of the order of four or five thousand more teachers in the schools in 1970. We cannot be content with present class sizes, as I have said. If parents and teachers, like us, want smaller classes, there must be even more teachers. If we are to achieve this we shall have to increase recruitment to teaching beyond the level that we expect from the steps taken so far, even making the most optimistic assumptions about the S.R.S. and the effect of salary changes, probably next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my right hon. Friend and I believe that any new steps should be taken if at all possible with the co-operation of the profession. So we propose to invite representatives of the profession to discuss with us—in an open-ended discussion—the courses of action open to us. I hope that before the winter we shall all, together, have been able to reach some conclusions. We recognise the profession's sincere concern for the future of education in Scotland. The profession, I believe, recognises ours. It seems to us right that we should discuss together the problems facing us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend seems to be suggesting that when these discussions with teachers take place they will be based on the idea that teaching is to continue as it is for ever more. Already, in language laboratories, mechanical means of getting the children to learn by themselves—with, perhaps, expert supervision—is making possible greater tuition by one teacher of a larger number of pupils. Does my hon. Friend intend to discuss with the profession the modernisation of teaching? Ferrantis have a teaching machine which is not yet being used. All these things are available to us. Does she intend to discuss these new methods with the teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is obvious to me that many hon. Members desire to participate in the debate, but if they are to intervene to put questions to Ministers, and speak for lengthy periods in doing so, it will somewhat restrict the number of hon. Members I shall be able to get into the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell my right hon. Friend that the kind of thing he has mentioned is continually under discussion with the profession, and officials of the Department are frequently exchanging views on and co-operating in relation to precisely that kind of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One change in training, which is now going ahead, is the introduction of college of education courses leading to a university degree as well as a professional qualification—the B.Ed. courses recommended by the Robbins Committee. They cannot themselves make any large difference to the total supply of teachers, but they are a development to be welcomed on two counts—on educational grounds, and because they create a closer relationship between the colleges and the universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these courses is expected to be started next session by Aberdeen College of Education, in conjunction with Aberdeen University. My right hon. Friend proposes, therefore, shortly to publish Draft amending Regulations making the necessary formal changes in the Teacher Training Regulations to enable the colleges of education to provide courses of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the content of education. What secondary courses do we plan for our school pupils? This is obviously one of the most important issues that face us. The hon. Lady quite rightly spent a good deal of her time discussing this aspect, and in most of the things she said she was absolutely right. What we need is a radical change in outlook and in teaching methods. Indeed, I am certain that, depending on the circumstances in particular areas, there may be advantage in some of the children concerned taking certain courses, or parts of them, not in school but in further education colleges. We need to be flexible. What we have to do is to make sure that the schools provide the best all-round education suitable to the abilities and the interests of the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the emphasis we are placing on comprehensive forms of education will help the schools to do this. A circular outlining the considerations that we think should guide the education authorities in working towards a comprehensive pattern has been sent in draft to the local authority associations and the other educational bodies. My right hon. Friend hopes that, after taking account
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
of their comments, he will be able to have the circular issued in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the proper aims of secondary education can be fully achieved only if the system of secondary school provision is organised on a comprehensive pattern, and if it is enabled to allow all children to develop a pride in their own achievements. We have to avoid a situation which at present in those schools that are non-comprehensive can result in many of our young people feeling a sense of inadequacy and failure, with all the frustration and boredom that go with it. We in Scotland have already gone quite a long way towards a comprehensive organisation, but there is still more to be done in this direction, not only in building but in organising the curriculum for secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In approaching the whole question of redirection of secondary courses, we have this invaluable source of guidance, the Brunton Report—"From School To Further Education". The stress which the Brunton Working Party put on the value of vocationally-biased courses has led to a good deal of re-thinking, and in the past year or so a lot of effort has been made by education authorities and teachers in working towards courses of that kind. A number of changes are going on in secondary schools now. Many changes are already taking place. What is essential is to give to the children something that has real meaning for them in relation to the life they expect to have after leaving school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does not mean—and I think that the hon. Lady was quite right here—and must not mean, that we think only of the vocationally-biased course, though that is important. There is a lot of development in such things as linking the study of certain subjects with particular application in the modern world, such as using mathematics in a course concerned with retail distribution. I have seen this myself in a school in Fife, and there is a variety of craft courses in Glasgow, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Fife, pupils are to be introduced to work-based courses in their third year, and after they have had a chance to see where their interests lie they will, at the beginning of the fourth year, concentrate on a particular vocational field within which there will be specialised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
courses linked with the courses in technical colleges as a final stage. A lot of useful experiments with work-based courses have already been conducted in some Fife schools and colleges. These involve commerce, engineering, building, agriculture, catering and, as I have said, retail distribution. At the other end of the country, in Ross-shire, courses centred on boat-building and weaving are being established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one side, but there is the other side, which is learning to do things that will be valuable when the young person has left school. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend a conference on "Youth and the Arts" organised by the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council. One there heard of the tremendous efforts being made all over the country to give children who are not following certificate courses the opportunity to learn instruments and be members of orchestras, to take part in drama and the arts, and the whole field of social studies, in which I am keenly interested, because I think that there is much to be done in modernising the way we teach children about the world in which they will live. These examples are given to show that we are very concerned about this aspect of the work lying ahead in preparation for the raising of the age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my right hon. Friend's intention, in order to widen the range of interests and experience from which educational advice can regularly and easily be available to him, to establish a permanent consultative committee to deal with the general problems that arise over the curriculum in the schools. Among the first tasks to which he will ask this committee to give its attention will be advice on the curricula for the third and fourth years of non-certificate courses which will enable the schools to offer the right kind of course, not only in the field of vocationally-biassed education but also in the equally important field of social education and preparation for living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultative committee will be composed of teachers, directors of education and others in various branches of higher and professional education, together with a few of our principal advisers on curricular matters. The Secretary of the Department will act as chairman. Apart from the departmental members,
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
appointments to the committee will be on the basis of the contribution the individual members can be expected to make to its work. There will be links with the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board and the Scottish Council for Research in Education. A total membership of about 20 is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main practical problems will be to find or provide by the end of 1970, when the full impact of extra numbers will be about to be reached, the additional accommodation needed for the raising of the age. It is by no means an insuperable problem, but it will demand a sound, practical and co-operative approach if it is to be solved without unacceptably checking the pace of building to meet other school needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the first tasks has been to assess the size of the problem in broad terms, and to consider the additional investment that will be needed. Investment, of course, must be related to resources in terms of building skill, labour and materials. What we are doing is to look at all programmes so as to strike the balance between what might be ideal and what is, in fact, possible. This is bound to take time, and it will therefore be some months yet before we can tell each education authority what it can count upon in the way of capital investment beyond the autumn of 1967, which is as far as current allocations go. It is our intention that there should be enough investment available for essential additional accommodation for the raising of the age to be provided by the end of 1970. But we shall be bound to ask education authorities to be realistic, and to apply fairly rigorous tests in considering what is essential in the way of additional accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already many schools, due for completion before 1970, that are being designed to accommodate the extra numbers. In some areas, there will be scope for utilising existing accommodation more fully. There are still, here and there, some schools which can, by more intensive use—I do not mean by crowding up the classrooms, but by arrangements within the schools—manage to accommodate more pupils quite happily. Some of the older school buildings which will go out of use by 1970 will be entirely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
unsuitable, but the best of them will, perhaps, with some doing-up, some minor interior adaptation and refurbishing, fit quite well for a few years into the new pattern of activities and organisation for secondary pupils. Unless we look realistically at the accommodation problem, we are bound to run into difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, quite obviously, the bulk of the provision will have to be in newly-built accommodation. This will represent many millions of £s worth of new buildings at a period when, in the educational field alone, there will be other expanding needs to be met, and when capital investment involving the construction industries will be reaching even higher levels. The amount of building that it is practicable to take in hand, and, more important, the rate at which the work can be completed, are determined by the available resources of skill, labour and materials. It is clear that if we are to rely entirely on the conventional skills, the customary ways of organising and using building labour and the traditional materials and traditional methods of putting them together, we could not hope to succeed in providing the essential additional accommodation. We shall have to adopt methods and designs which will give a further bonus in output on top of what might be regarded as a normal increase in productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since buildings for raising the leaving age will have to be provided in a relatively short, concentrated programme, it seems to me that there is everything to be said for economising as much as possible on the design effort involved and on the amount of conventional skilled building labour required. All these will be required to the full to progress the normal building programmes. What we have in mind—we are considering this now as a matter of urgency—is the possibility of meeting a large part of the new building needed for the raising of the age by a co-ordinated programme relying essentially on industrialised building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local circumstances—site difficulties and so on—may mean that special solutions have to be worked out, but we believe that much of the additional accommodation required can be provided
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
in the form of extensions of rationalised but flexible design. They must, of course, be capable of use for a variety of activities, but a measure of rationalisation should be possible. If units of accommodation are designed which themselves can be used for various activities, and can be assembled in various combinations, it becomes practicable to consider a system of building which minimises the amount of design effort required in each case, which reduces the amount of site labour for erection, and which makes it easier to programme the ordering of components to ensure, among other things, continuity of supply in a period of high demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed way in which such a scheme would operate has yet to be worked out, but I expect shortly to approach the education authorities with outline proposals. I certainly think that there are possibilities in a programme of this kind; indeed, I believe that something like this is imperative if the additional places needed are to be provided in time. I should make it clear that I am certainly not thinking of temporary buildings of a makeshift kind but of permanent extensions which will represent a very valuable addition to our total resources of accommodation and facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken an important step already. We have been in discussion with the National Building Agency and, although arrangements have not yet been finalised, we have the Agency's agreement in outline to its participation in arrangements for the programme for school-leaving age accommodation. The intention is that the National Building Agency in Scotland will take over the development of plans and the organisation of component supplies and serial contracts. The Agency will be willing to provide a similar approach for the building of school hostels. Leaving aside all the details about the letting of contracts and so on, these arrangements should be of great use in lightening the load on education authorities' professional staffs at a very crucial time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is so much more to be said on this subject, but I want to hear what hon. Members have to say. I am sorry if I have kept the Committee a little long, but there was so much to be said and which had to be said. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
this morning we may have a really fruitful discussion about a matter on which we all share the same intense concern, that of making sure that what we provide for more children, older children, in 1970–71, can match our ambitions and our ideals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been suggested that the long watches on the Finance Bill are made more tolerable to lady Members of the Commons through their being able to gaze on the beauty of the Financial Secretary. There can be no Committee offering a more charming experience for male Members than we have had here today in the presence and speeches from two hon. Ladies. The Liberal Party must see what it can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate both the Under-Secretary and the hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) on their speeches and on sticking to the important question in education of how to prepare for the raising of the school-leaving age, which will be on us all too soon. I wish to take up one or two points made by the Under-Secretary. She said that there was to be a very considerable expansion of teacher-training and of particular teacher-training colleges. This is obviously essential. I comment on the fact that it would appear that the estimate for the coming year is £3,900,000 as against £3,750,000 spent last year under the heading "Teaching-Training" That barely, if at all, keeps up with inflation. Already this year there has been a 5 per cent. increase of inflation. I am not at the moment pressing that more should be spent because it may be that already for this year more money is in the process of being spent, but I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that a very small increase is provided under this heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also referred to the associateship courses. I understand that these courses have been received with some reservations by the teaching profession. A principal doubt seems to arise on the point whether it may simply take some teachers from other courses, particularly in Chapter VI subjects. I am not entirely convinced that this is so, but in winding up perhaps the Minister could make some comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the proposal for a Bachelorship in education and also the
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
proposal that there should be a working party on the content of education and curricula. I will not go into that in detail, but I draw the attention of the hon. Lady to the speech made by the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) in the debate on the Brunton Report last year. He said a number of pungent things on this subject, particularly on the need to take the advice of people outside education as well as those in education, and to remember very important matters concerned with after-life and home-life. That was all very well expressed in his speech last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two rather special points about education in general. In the North of Scotland the technical training which children are getting after school is extremely important if we are to keep the population there. The Scottish Office must always bear in mind the very important effects which education has on depopulation or keeping population. This is a difficult matter to deal with. It touches on the centralisation of schools and the type of education—weaving and boat-building and so on which are suitable to those areas—and it is a matter of great importance. Secondly, it is a matter which should be brought to the early attention of the new Highland Development Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also spoke about new buildings. I was surprised in the time of the last Government to get a reply from the right hon. and learned Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Hogg) that the new schools then being built were not taking into account the increase in the number of pupils which will come into effect after the raising of the school-leaving age. It was a surprising answer, and I think it surprised the right hon. and learned Gentleman, but I take it that now all new school building is taking that into account. The hon. Lady spoke about bringing in industrialised methods of building for the schools. The Committee will welcome this. We have to press on with school building and this may be a sensible way of doing so, but I enter a small caveat. In some areas where local materials and local labour can be used I should not like to think that the schools were too centralised either in construction or in design. My constituency has some very good new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
schools but they are apt to be built with almost the whole side of a school room consisting of glass. That is not very good when we get a 50 m.p.h. gale, nor when the weather is very hot. It can be extremely hot in these rooms in Orkney and Shetland. This practice also makes a school expensive to heat in winter. Double-glazing would be the answer in some parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It strikes me when going round my constituency that methods of keeping in repair and improving schools need to be looked at more closely. For many years in my constituency children have been going to schools which are not fundamentally too bad but where, for instance, the lavatories are an absolute disgrace. Children have been playing on the edge of cesspits. Many of these things could be put right not at a great expense, but if one says to the people concerned that they should be put right, the answer usually is, "This school will come down in five or 10 years." By that time a whole generation of children will have been through the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the very vital subject of the supply of teachers it is unlikely that any hon. Member in the Committee will put forward new and revolutionary suggestions. We can look at what is being done and try to consider the priorities. It would be very agreeable to have a separate debate on further education in all its aspects, but I presume that we have not time for that. The first priority is to train teachers. I justify that statement on the ground that although it is not the sole purpose by any means, there shall be a high priority for training people to serve the community. There are few things that the community needs more than a good supply of teachers. This is quite apart from our views about the content or aims or methods of education, for children cannot be trained by any method without teachers. When we look at all possible forms of education we find that this is the first priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of teacher shortage divides itself into short-term and long-term. If we are to increase the supply in the short-term, we cannot do so in the immediate future by training more teachers, but we have to take steps to use the existing supply and facilities at their disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
We have not heard a great deal—although both hon. Ladies touched on the subject—about the prospect of teaching aids. One of the main means of keeping up or improving the standards of schools is closed-circuit television and various teaching aids. The question of standards exercises the teaching profession a great deal, but I am afraid that we do not live in an ideal world. Standards are already falling. Evidence for this can be found in the Report before us. In referring to Glasgow, it says that shortages
	<br><blockquote><p>"appear to be becoming progressively worse. As one consequence, upwards of 2,000 pupils in the city receive only part-time education …"</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been necessary practically everywhere to withdraw specialist instruction in such subjects as art, music and physical education …"</p></blockquote>
On page 25 it describes the difficulties about staffing in secondary schools and says that reports
	<br><blockquote><p>"describe the work of the secondary schools as a whole as thorough and reasonably effective rather than inspired or inspiring."</p></blockquote>
We have to face the fact that in some cases standards are falling. There appears to be a large deficiency of teachers in some subjects and a comparatively small deficiency of teachers in others, one of the most important being the deficiency among teachers of mathematics and commerce. It is reasonable of the Government to consider giving some special inducement for teachers to go into special subjects. There may be difficulties about this, but one cannot put forward a perfect solution. All we can do is to suggest possibilities among the various suggestions which are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When referring to inducements, would the right hon. Member suggest more favourable grants to universities for those reading, for example, mathematics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would consider this. I think this is an important subject, which I will not go into for the reason that to talk about the universities and their relationship to schools is a large and difficult subject which would take too much time. But I would be prepared to look at this suggestion as a short-term measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a problem which we have to face. The shortages are very much greater in some subjects than others and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
in some cases in subjects which seem to me to be more important than the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Then we have to get back the retired teachers. I would not be chary of giving them great inducements and treating them very favourably with pension rights. One of the difficulties for teachers going back to a certain type of school is the necessity to learn the art of keeping order. This is quite a problem. I know that there are retraining courses, but I wonder whether it is possible to deal with this by easing teachers back gradually. In the longer run there is no substitute for increasing the intake into the profession, and there is no way of getting round that except by giving the profession better standards, better pay and better status. I think that anyone looking at the figures would not claim that we overpaid our teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers are sensitive to any suggestion that the standards of their training should be lowered, and so am I. I am glad that the move to bring in auxiliaries is now gaining acceptance, and there is agreement over the sort of tasks which the auxiliaries should do. I think that they could play a most valuable part. As someone who has a comparatively young child being educated, I would say that it is a very skilled job to deal with young children, but the skill required is not quite the same as that required to teach older children. There may be room for employing auxiliaries on a wider scale still, not so much to teach the children, but to look after them, on a wider scale than that currently suggested. I think that we can do more in bringing up the standard of uncertificated teachers when we can find space for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of status is important for the community as well as for the teachers. Teachers now are expected to undertake all sorts of jobs which harass some of them and fill up their lives. I do not think their prestige is as great as it was, and I do not believe there is any real solution to this except by improving their terms of service. But something can be done by raising them in the whole hierarchy of the educational system, as against the university lecturer and his equivalent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
This Committee might also look into the social conditions of education. The first thing that the British ever do when discussing a subject is to get it divided into upper and lower classes. Status comes into it, and I think it is now quite important, even in the teaching profession. I very much doubt whether anyone at this stage can give the hon. Lady the Under-Secrstary of State the solution to her problems, but I would place this problem of teacher shortage as the most important and I would direct the main effort in further education towards improving it. In the short run we have to ask the teachers to accept new teaching methods and to work harder, possibly extending the school year so that we can get through more pupils, We have to remember that it is not a question of lowering standards, but a question of trying to keep up standards, which in some parts of the country are already being lowered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what has been said by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), particularly with reference to teachers. In agreeing with what he has said I am saved extending my own speech. I do not think there is a single solution to this problem. We have tried all sorts of expediencies but they do not result in an accretion of strength of teachers. I would stress the point made by the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland that teachers are the first priority. They must be, because if they are good teachers they are able to teach in barns or adapt disused or unused buildings for the purpose of teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) referred to me as I came into the room. I thought I did not make political speeches, but apparently the hon. Lady thought that one particular speech of mine was political. I think that we are entitled, on these benches, to believe that some of those speeches have probably had some effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the hon. Lady's reticence in not wanting to enter into political argument and I can understand her modesty on this subject, but I think that the debate on further education in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
1960 had a profound effect on the formation and the production of the Brunton Report, which we have discussed already, and which we are discussing, in part, today. Along with Newsom, it is one of the most important social documents produced, and bears out the contentions which some of us have been arguing for years, asking that the same attention be given to the forgotten army of the 15-year-olds and afterwards, as is given to those of greater ability. There is no reason why a sane society should not have been making use of the ability of these young people and developing it. The tragedy is that in previous years that wealth of talent has been lost to the nation. I will not develop the point because I am in great danger of making another political speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity of discovering how we can better the position of the under-privileged who leave school at 15. Their education needs are as compelling as their physical ones, and they have been neglected for far too long. The Committee must bear this in mind in its discussion on curricula, and what it is going to do with the extra year. This is the important question because "long", like "bigger", does not necessarily mean better. It is most important that our authorities and the Department get together in trying to arrange the best use of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Newsom and Brunton say that when the age is raised, the last two years of education should be formally school-based, but should be made outward-looking, towards adult life in its vocational and civic aspects, and that effective teaching methods should be explored to help these young people to become confidently articulate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third requirement which I think applies to all sections of education, and that is the need to teach children how to learn. This is one of the aspects to which we have not paid sufficient attention. At present these young people are turned out of school at the age of 15, inadequately equipped to withstand the blandishments of the commercial world, which is waiting to exploit their vast store of idealism. What the nation has lost in this way cannot be estimated. There seems to be a lack of purpose in young people, in avoidance of mental effort and an addiction to time-wasting,
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
which is damaging at their age, when there is the maximum amount of physical and mental energy available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that the other courses in senior school and universities are non-vocational but I do not accept this. It is one of the phrases in Brunton which I do not accept. University training has always been highly vocational, but for the professions. It is certainly not for educational purposes alone that young people seek to get a Senior Leaving Certificate. It is because it is their entrance to better salaries and more attractive ways of living. If this is given to them merely by accident of aptitude and ability, there is no reason why those in the 15-year-old range should not also have the same opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter which has given me some concern is the question of "O" level examinations. I am informed that there are many young people who are encouraged to take "O" level examinations and are then further, and unwisely, encouraged by success, to attempt further higher examinations. The result is that when they are disappointed they are over 16 years of age and cannot qualify to enter a different job or profession or even apprenticeship. I know that a satisfactory "O" level result would normally entitle a boy to go into some other job. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has been informed of this problem, but I would be grateful if she would look into it at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with interest to what has been said about buildings. The Under-Secretary of State will be aware that in the City of Glasgow the position is really bad. At the present moment we are short of 1,000 teachers. We are short of school buildings, and delays are taking place between the submission of sketch plans and permission being given to proceed. I am trying to ascertain what the interval is after authority has been given by the Department and the actual start of the buildings. In recent correspondence I submitted a list of 26 projects which have taken from 12 to 26 weeks between sketch plans being submitted and authority being given. The Under-Secretary of State was good enough to indicated in a letter that an investigation is taking place and indicated that there is scope for reducing the average time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
between the submission of sketch plans by the authority and their final approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From the analysis we have made of the history of the projects in your list it is clear that the arrangements for informal consultations between the Department's and Glasgow's technical advisers have been unsatisfactory from this point of view. Too much time has been involved, at the formal stage, in tidying up numerous points of planning detail which ought to have been resolved informally before then."</p></blockquote>
My point is that I should have thought this would have become obvious, either to the Department or to Glasgow by informal discussions and it would not have been necessary to have pursued this in this Committee. I hope that the examination and the review of the processes is not, itself, going to take a long time and that the Department will, in consultation with the local authority, minimise the delays taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might appreciate a very quick answer. We have had, for some little time now, an informal working party of Departmental officials and officials of the Corporation carrying out a continuous examination on this subject. It ought to be possible to reduce the time and to arrive at arrangements which will be more satisfactory in the future. Through the working party we can maintain informal consultations which, as has been pointed out, are so necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that assurance. We know more places in schools are needed and there are thousands of teachers needed. We need to bend our efforts towards general problems. It may be of interest to note a point about the number of places. For other purposes I have been seeking information on the birth rate in Scotland, 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> England and Wales and other countries. In a comparison between Scotland, England and Wales, France, the German Federal Republic and Italy, Scotland's live birth rate per 1,000 population is higher than all of those countries, and has been since 1956. My authority for this statement, which I have obtained from the Library, is the United Nations Year Book, the Registrar-General's quarterly return for Scotland, at 31st March, 1963, and the Symposium of Vital Statistics. I want to draw atten-
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
tion to this point, in the hope that we shall not be caught out in respect of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of buildings depends upon the rate of economic growth of a country and the increase in the efficiency of the building industry. We have heard something about this from my hon. Friend. I welcome her statement and hope that the Department, the building industry and local authorities will be successful in establishing a high degree of co-operation. I hope that there will also be speedy decisions as a result of discussions between the Department and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to the question of teachers only in general, because the right hon. Gentleman has already made most of my points. I should like to be reassured on one point concerning the establishment of a Bachelor of Education course. The Robbins Report recommended that these courses should be under the supervision of the universities, but since those universities are under the supervision of the Secretary of State for Education and Science it would seem that ultimate control over colleges of education is passing from the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that argument forward when the announcement was made by the previous Government. If this is eventually to be the case, I deeply regret it, as many of my hon. Friends will. It will mean that the Secretary of State for Scotland will be responsible only for education in the schools. Although he will be consulted in respect of procedures within the colleges and universities, the ultimate decisions will not be made by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret to say that in my opinion the Bachelor of Education course will not produce the hundreds of teachers that we need now, and not in 1970. I have also regretfully come to the conclusion that the associateship course will not provide the necessary teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a brief criticism of the E.I.S. attitude. I do so in the friendliest way possible. Many of the proposals which are made confuse my hon. Friends and me. We have the Bachelor of Education course, the associateship course, and the three-year diploma course, while some teachers insist that, above all, there must be higher salaries to enable the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
teaching profession to meet the competition of industry. I do not believe that we shall win the battle of industry and be able to attract young people to the profession, for other and more fundamental reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the "Educational Journal" for April, 1964 I read an article concerning the examination question whose whole trend was critical of the single examination which decides the future of young people. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For far too long has the result of a single examination dictated the future careers of school leavers."</p></blockquote>
Later—and this is significant—it said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"employers and professional bodies"—</p></blockquote>
and I assume that the E.I.S. must be counted among them—
	<br><blockquote><p>"increasingly tend to require examination passes as the hallmark of achievement. The cult of the élite is certainly making progress. In a hard world, the facts of life have to be faced and in consequence more pupils are staying on in order to acquire the 	<i>cachet</i> necessary for admission to the upper echelons of our budding meritocracy and this at a time when teachers are trying to make class work realistic and relevant to contemporary needs outside the school."</p></blockquote>
That is in keeping with what the right hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to a second article, published this month under the heading of "Principals at odds", which insists that if the associateship course comes it will provide only between 200 and 400 more teachers and will be open to men and women of a lower educational degree. That is the result of the single examination of which .it was previously complaining. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This was obviously not the compelling argument which the Institute insisted must be adduced before it could consent to a lowering of standards."</p></blockquote>
If this single examination result is complained about because it sends some boys on one road and some boys on another, where is the esesential difference between the boy who obtained three highers and two lowers and who failed to gain admission to a university, and the boy, or man, who by a single examination gained only two highers and three lowers, which, on a comparable basis, would admit him to a training college?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave the point there. I hope that I am not being unfair in stating the case. I have made a sincere examination of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
best way in which to obtain teachers. I am relieved to hear from my hon. Friend that further examination will be made of this question, in co-operation with the teachers' organisations—which is essential. They must be consulted at all levels and taken into the fullest confidence, in an attempt to find the best way to enlist teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question of day release. I mention this although it is not my hon. Friend's responsibility. I read in a report on day release that we are making some progress. Nevertheless, today only one in eight of our young people is attending day release classes. This makes a very bad comparison with Germany and other European countries, where day release has been compulsory since 1918. It is not wonder that these countries are outstripping us economically. It is time for the Government to make a statement on compulsory day release, if necessary dealing with the point industry by industry. I am sorry to add to my hon. Friend's worries. I realise the backlog which she has inherited from the previous Administration, but action is necessary in this respect if we are to provide for further necessary measures in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal concerning auxiliaries in schools was made at least 10 years ago. The hon. Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) was complaining about her minority report in the Newsom Report of 1958. There are other proposals which the present Administration do not accept. If a retired teacher takes a job as an auxiliary in a school, will he be able to get his pension and his salary? If he took a job as a janitor in the school he would receive his pension and his pay. If he left any of the Services with a pension he could go into teaching and receive his pay as well. Our need for teachers is so great that further consideration ought to be given to the possibility of adopting the wartime system, when policemen continued to receive their pensions and their salaries when they were re-employd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the statement about the auxiliaries. They should become the organisers. They should organise the school fetes and concerts, so relieving the teachers of clerical work and allowing headmasters to become acquainted with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
their staff—to know where they are, and who they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Department on the production of a new primary school handbook, and hope that it will become compulsory reading for all teachers and students. I welcome the new outlook. I hope that the Department will consider whether there has not been too long an interval since the previous issue. I believe that this was in 1950 or 1951. In the present quickly changing scene in the education world, 15 years is too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I have not more time to speak. I hope that my hon. Friend will pay attention to some of the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, T congratulate both hon. Ladies who have spoken from the respective Front Benches. I was extremely relieved to find that their speeches were mercifully free from party political arguments. The question of raising the school-leaving age is a matter of such importance as to be completely above party politics. It ought to be the aim of every hon. Member to assist the hon. Lady who is responsible for Scottish education in the great task that lies before her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to what I have to say was given by the hon. Lady herself, when she said that in Scotland we are making great progress towards comprehensive education. I suggest to her, with the greatest respect, that we are not so much making progress towards comprehensive education as getting back to our historical background of comprehensive education in Scotland. I remind her that, basically, education in Scotland is that of the parish or burgh school—the comprehensive school where all the children in the parish or burgh are educated under the same roof and are given the same opportunities. Many from those little schools often go to university and do very well. In fact, under this system many who otherwise would never have done so reach university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that over the last 40 years the tendency has been the other way—towards specialisation and streaming in schools, between what we might call the academic secondary and the junior or practical secondary. That system developed in the 1920s, and we now seem
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
to have an almost impenetrable barrier between the advanced pupil of those days and the secondary pupil. This barrier is being gradually broken down, but there is still a great danger of over-centralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak with any great knowledge about the great cities, but I can speak with some knowledge of the more rural parts of Scotland, where the tendency has been to close down many small secondary departments and concentrate them in the larger areas. To some extent that is a good thing. In my county of Aberdeen only a comparatively few years ago—in 1939—there were no fewer than 129 secondary schools of one sort or another. This number has been reduced to about 30. That reduction was justifiable, but I find that in about 20 of these the secondary rolls are below 20 pupils. That was inevitable, but the process has been carried too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Aberdeenshire, as in other parts of the country, burgh schools are bulging at the seams while, throughout the counties, many good schools and buildings, with good teaching staffs, are under-populated. I suggest that when the hon. Lady considers the question of raising the school-leaving age she should give some thought to resuscitating some of the secondary departments which have been closed as non-viable. I do not know where the break-even point comes, but I would have thought that about 80 or 100 pupils would probably be the practical minimum for a secondary school. If we raise the school-leaving age to 16, many of these schools could once again become viable, because of the increase in school population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how best this can be done, but it seems to me that the hon. Lady has given the key herself in that in the lower stages of secondary schools there might be completely comprehensive education. For the first three years, say, in these smaller schools the children, instead of being put into mutually exclusive classes, might be dealt with in sets so that each child could, in the lower stages of the secondary school, develop his or her aptitude. In that way, to a large extent the children would sort themselves out without the necessity for any examination at 11-plus, 12-plus or anything of that sort which causes a great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
deal of misery among the children themselves and great deal of concern among parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking a fortnight ago to a police constable who has two children of secondary school age. One is brighter than the other, and there was a great deal of misery in the family because one child had been sent to a good secondary school, but the other had been sent to a secondary school with a lesser reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for the smaller schools to deal with the first two or three years of secondary education. In saying that, I cast my mind back to my own school days. I may not be a good example of Scottish education, but I think it worked. I did my first three years of secondary education in one school, finishing there after the third year and then going to another school for the fourth and fifth years, from which I passed on to university. That is the traditional Scottish way of doing it, and I think we might study that and see if we cannot do something along similar lines. The advantage would be very great, not only to the children, because I believe it would make better use of the staffs available at the moment in the smaller secondary schools and would relieve the congestion in the bigger schools. I am thinking about such establishments as the Gordon Schools in Huntly and the Academy in Inverurie. A new school in my own constituency is already too small. I ask the hon. Lady to give some thought to the possible de-centralisation of all pupils in secondary schools at a lower level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Lady on one point, and that is in respect of the very brilliant child. The traditional Scottish way of dealing with him was to give a bursary, which might have had a financial connotation, or might not. But with a brilliant child there is a case for awarding to that child a place in a school where he can get specialised courses and the education which his ability requires. That should not be confined purely to academic subjects, but might very well be extended to music and other technical subjects which I think have very largely been poor relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Lady that when one is considering specialised courses, in a great many cases it would be better to send a child away not just for a lan-
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
guage course but for a technical course as well. It seems that a child is taken from a local school and sent to another school because that other school has facilities for teaching languages, whereas a most able child whose bent is for technical subjects is kept in the local school where the facilities for technical subjects are not and cannot be as good. I suggest that specialisation for technical subjects and music might be a good thing. Instead of increased centralisation, we should turn the clock back. After all, we have a lot to learn from our past in Scotland in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to be brief, because my hon. Friend in her speech this morning has to some extent given the kind of point of view I was going to express.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who served and suffered as a teacher for most of his life during Tory rule, I am not sure whether we should leave party politics out of this discussion. There are very distinct differences which have a definite bearing on our educational attitudes. I was glad to hear that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) recognises that secondary schools are a part of the Scottish system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told there are no party differences, but the school where I started teaching in 1949 was promised a new building in 1952 and has still not got it. From 1953 onwards, various attempts were made, but we were held up by numerous cuts. For session after session this school, by succeeding cuts, was removed from the top of the list and is still not built. The nearest it came to it was in the late 50's, when a site was found, but, unfortunately, it was discovered that it was subsiding. Our headmaster almost became the first headmaster to go down with his school. I do not think we should ignore party politics in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at some of the points raised about conditions in various places, we should remember that the shortage of teachers is not only a global shortage but that there are huge discrepancies within Scotland. We discover that 11·8 per cent. of the classes in Glasgow are oversize, compared with only 3·4 per cent. in Aberdeen. If we are going to reallocate on a fair and correct basis the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
supply of teachers throughout Scotland, the position is that Glasgow will require 626 more teachers and Aberdeen will give up 449. Within the shortage there is that colossal discrepancy which has to be looked at carefully to see what kind of system can be worked out for a fair and reasonable allocation of teachers. Certainly it cannot be left as it is. I do not think the suggestion advanced of a special payment in certain areas is the solution. We have to consider the question of a quota allocation of teachers completing their training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to have a quick look at what was said by the Under Secretary of State for Scotland. For many months, we have been advocating that what is needed is an open-ended discussion between the Department, the Minister and the teachers themselves. I think there is pretty clear agreement that the existing regulations and qualifications are not the most perfect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was actively involved at the time of the teachers' strike three or four years ago. It was a bitter strike caused by bitter experience and was based on the question of dilution—the point the hon. Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) is still gently advocating. At that time the strike which was fought by the Glasgow teachers was on the basis not that existing qualifications were the best possible but that the only solutions that were being brought forward were solutions of dilution. There was no sign of increased effort and anxiety in other directions. I do not think that is quite the situation today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand my hon. Friend's difficulties and what has given rise to her suggestion for an open-ended discussion. Even at that time the teachers agreed that the situation was not the most perfect, but we had to fight because no other solutions were coming forward. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) will remember it very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, I would make this appeal to teachers in Scotland. I hope they welcome the proposal by my hon. Friend to have discussions without any strings attached and without any ideas either of associateship or other regulations. Let us look carefully at the whole question of qualifications and regulations so that some kind of agreement can be reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great possibility that the teachers will welcome the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for an open-ended discussion, and I was very glad to hear her use that expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is different from what it has been in the past. The normal traditional rôle for boys was university, whereas girls to a much bigger extent were sent to training colleges. Therefore, at that time, if the proposals put forward by the party opposite had been put into practice, boys of very inferior ability would have entered under the scheme. But the position we are now facing, with an increasing percentage of pupils staying on at school, is that there is an actual shortage of places in universities which cannot be overcome. We have to cope with a developing reservoir of boys who have sufficient academic qualifications to go to university but who cannot find places. This is a problem that we must face far more than we have been doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to know from my hon. Friend who will be invited to the discussion. Will they be officials of the S.E.D. and her hon. Friends, or both? Who will be invited as representatives of the teachers' organisations, or what we sometimes call educationists? Thirdly, can we have the assurance that she intends it to be an open-ended discussion without any strings attached, to look at the whole question regardless of any proposals that have come forward previously?

The Special Recruitment Scheme, which my hon. Friend has really got off
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
the ground for the first time, has already contributed considerably to teachers in Scotland. I have been concerned with six entrants to that scheme, and four of them have gained first-class honours. I have been closely involved in one way and another in advising on this scheme, and find that one of the problems is that the people who administer it tend to take the attitude that before they accept anyone for entry that person must prove himself. One of those who gained first-class honours has commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present system seems to impose hardships not of an intellectual but of a 'character-strength' nature. You are apparently expected to 'prove yourself' first by obtaining one or two Highers on your own, while doing a full-time job, before the Scheme will adopt you. This means test on 'virtue and integrity' would be more appropriate if there were too many teachers. In the present circumstances this method is difficult to understand.… The present stress on sheer stamina of endurance would make one think that the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme is in charge of the Scheme as well."</p></blockquote>
We should look carefully at the possibility of finding other methods by which applicants can be assessed besides asking them in the meantime to gain one or two Highers on their own. In the special recruitment scheme we should develop a new method, and not impose that requirement about getting one or two Highers before acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Mary-hill (Mr. Hannan). We all know that a single examination—perhaps a series of examinations—is not necessarily a test of potential. I therefore ask all the parties concerned to have an urgent meeting with the universities. The universities are so worried about their so-called academic freedom which often is no freedom at all, and an attempt should be made to persuade them to look again at their attitude towards adult education. I do not see why people should be taken into the special recruitment scheme at 25 or over and then be asked to repeat the kind of education provided for children of 14, 15, 16 or 17. That is to impose the necessity of adolescent education in order to put people into adult education. All who are interested in the universities should try to persuade them to scrap this insistence on existing forms of university entry, and should see whether a better assessment of adult potential cannot be worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
I am not quite clear what my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill meant when he referred to the attitude of young people at the present time. I think that the young people of today represent probably the best generation the country has ever had. While their great irreverence is often expressed in an extremely ebullient fashion, we must remember that among them we have more ability than probably ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can see this in some of the work produced by those who have been regarded as failures. A 14-year-old boy who was considered a failure, and who had to repeat his second year before he left, wrote this poem:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everest, a mountain, snow covered and high,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>All around, ice, broken by the frozen rocks,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Like a mirror broken, crippled on the floor …"</p></blockquote>
That boy could project himself above the mountain in order to look down on the ice being broken by the rocks, and compare it with a mirror broken on the floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The younger generation seems to me to be a very fine and good one, and certainly very much better in its moral attitude than the stipendiary magistrate in Glasgow was who could say to a young boy that he intended to crush people like him under his feet like beetles. The morality is on the side of the young person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a particularly useful debate, not least because of the extremely constructive approach made by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson), followed by the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary of State. As one who has for the last 11 years been very actively connected with youth work and has seen from the outside to some extent the effects of the optional fourth year at schools, I have certain fairly strong feelings on it. It has been clear to me that far too often that optional fourth year has been treated merely as a marking-time period for a young person who has not quite known what he wants to do afterwards. As a result, very little of value has emerged from it. It has been a time of boredom and frustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important tasks, in preparing for 1970 is to make sure that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
kind of education we provide in that extra year, which will no longer be optional but compulsory, is education in the widest sense, and that the opportunity offered is not wasted. We have already heard that 65 per cent. of all pupils do not take certificate courses. They are the non-academic pupils, and it is with those that we are really concerned today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this extra year is to be useful, and the type of education correct, it is important that we should have better career advice for these young people so that they may know what they are doing, with the curriculum geared to the work they will eventually do. I do not mean that the curriculum should be geared to particular crafts or trades, but if young people know better what they want to do there is much more chance that the courses will be in line with their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important things is to have greater co-operation with local industry. That is something on which Brunton laid great emphasis. A lot of lip service has been paid to it since, but not enough has been done between schools, local education authorities and industry. That comes in at two levels. First of all, there is career guidance. If there is this co-operation, there is among local industrialists and businessmen a ready-made source of advice to be had for the asking. That goes even further—to the getting of assistance for the type of vocational and commercial training we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In areas away from the industrial belt there is a shortage of jobs locally but, even so, there is not the co-operation one would like to see between educational and local authorities and industry. School-masters who are members of education committees, and education officers, do not know what opportunities there are in industry. There is a great deal of scope for more visits between schools and industry, possibly in these courses for boys and girls taking part in industry. The Factory Acts might make this difficult but steps could be taken by the Government to overcome that. In particular one would hope that through the industrial training boards some attention would be paid by industry to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the curriculum of vocational training, we should pay more attention to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
needs of training people in the use of their leisure time. In this extra year at school, far more could be done to make students aware of the opportunities of leisure. This applies not only to physical sports, but to all outside interests. In particular, if we could give encouragement to photographic clubs, and so on, a great deal could be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school in my constituency—the Mackie Academy, in Stonehaven—has for three years now entered for the Saltire award which is for students doing non-certificate courses. They have won on every occasion this year. This year the pupils re-enacted scenes from Scott's novel "Old Mortality". I know that participation in this Award has brought home to them their great Scottish heritage in art and literature. There is also great opportunity in outdoor training through the S.C.P.R.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should also be a great deal more co-operation in the latter years of school with the voluntary youth services outside. One example of this is the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. I have personal experience of that award, and I know how, through it, we can bring into contact with young people many of those with specialised training and specialised interests who can help. Co-ordination between schools and such organisations could be of immense benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But all this will fail unless we have the co-operation of parents. Without that co-operation to give a sense of vocation both to schools and the youth organisations, all our other efforts will be very much wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that this debate would have been marked by, if not remarkable for, the excellence of the speeches from each Front Bench and the good looks of those taking part. Unfortunately, as hon. Members may have known, my noble Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) was stricken ill this morning, which is why I am rather ineffectively deputising for her. At the same time, I am sure that the Committee will join me in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) on a very excellent speech. I know, from having attended a good many of these debates in the past, that the whole quality of the debate has been improved by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
example she set in not trying to score political points. This is an advantage in a serious debate on a very serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) rightly drew attention to the fact that the advance in these Estimates is practically minimal, while cost inflation is already wearing away such advance as there may be. It is the duty of the Government of the day, of whichever party, firmly to decide the priorities they want to give to the various types of work—social services, education, and so on—and to stick to them. We were very often fairly bitterly attacked on the grounds that we were not giving a high enough priority in money to education, but I am sure that the Government, after even eight or nine months of office, are facing the same sort of problems that we found. The hon. Lady gave one or two good examples of the difficulty of trying to run an economy fully extended and find money for all the extra things one wants. The last two Finance Bills have taken over £500 million of extra taxation, and I am personally a little surprised that more of that money has not found its way into education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two things that will probably be agreed, at least tacitly, by both sides, can often be better said from this Front Bench than from that because, inevitably, if the Government are apparently giving advice, people think that they are doing so for their own particular purpose, and the advice is sometimes devalued as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, particularly for us in Scotland, to reaffirm quite clearly the purpose we seek in education. The purpose is simply, as the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) put it, to prepare people for life. We have heard some interesting and correct suggestions from both sides of the Committee on the better use of training for leisure time, for the arts, and so on. These are important, but what most of us realise is that the success or failure of the education system lies in whether or not we prepare our young people for the sort of work in Scotland—and I stress, in Scotland—we hope that they will be able to do in the years ahead. That means that we have to train our young people for new and greater skills in craftsmanship,
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
technology, management and so forth. That is our purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a great tradition in Scotland. Traditions can be of great value, but they can be of very considerable danger if we regard them as something that cannot be changed. I therefore think it right that there should go out from this Committee an appeal to all those interested in education—whether they be teachers, local authorities, or even the Scottish Educational Department—that before they sit down to these open-ended discussions they will be prepared to look at the problems of education from a practical and realistic point of view. There is no purpose in saying, "We have always done it this way; this is the way in which we have built up our tradition", if by doing it that way we automatically deny the possibility of making changes which everyone in his heart knows must come. If we want to have the age limit extended in 1970–71 some things have to change. It is no use everyone sitting quietly back on the position adopted for years and saying, "We still want the Government to do it". If they do that, the Government will either not be able to do it or, if forced to do it in those circumstances, will have to allow classes which are too big and all the other problems which cause trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland we need the school-leaving age to be extended, as the hon. Lady said, at the earliest possible moment. It may be that in two years' time or so it may still be impossible for the Government of the day, whichever Government it may be, to come forward with the exact date. I very much hope that will not be so. I entirely agree with the hon. Lady that at the moment all our efforts must be bent to achieve this aim because it is what we need for the industrial future of Scotland. I appeal to all people attending these open-ended discussions to abandon some of their prejudices. I shall not be more specific than that; each will know quite clearly in his heart what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning for a moment or two to particular problems we have been discussing this morning, I wish to say a few words about each of them. When we were discussing problems of school buildings I was suddenly brought very sharply to the alert when I heard the hon. Lady
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
reading what clearly was part of the brief of the speech I made in the last two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the part asking education authorities to be realistic and to realise that there were limits to the resources and so on for a greatly increased building programme. This was what I said a year or so before. I was told to abandon all these things, but I know the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a great deal of discussion, on both sides of the Committee, about the status of teachers. This I accept; this is important. Certainly we must increase their pay. I notice that the hon. Lady referred with great diplomacy to "changes in pay" which might take place next year. I think all of us accept that she can say "increases in pay" without being too worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But are we not sometimes in danger of regarding our school buildings as status symbols? I throw this out to the Committee. Are we not perhaps spending too much money on each individual school building and thereby not getting real value for money in the attempt we all want to make to solve the problem of making our educational money go as far as possible? It was for this purpose that I particularly welcomed what the hon. Lady said about the National Building Agency. It is in that wav that we can get value for money. Even if there is a certain uniformity in schools dotted about different parts of Scotland, at least for the next four or five years, I would accept it if we got more schools and it did not mean that each education authority was trying to beat another by having a more splendid school than the one next door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say to the hon. Lady how grateful I was for her comment, although I know that she will not have time to enlarge on it, about school hostels in the Highlands. This is a very special Highland problem. Highland authorities will regard it with great favour if she realises that there is a separate additional problem for school buildings in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just a word on teacher supply. We have all to accept that the percentage of graduates going into teaching is not likely to increase much. In fact, to an extent
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
it would be a failure of our thinking and policies in Scotland if more did go because we need a great many more graduates in the newer type of industry which we are trying to build in Scotland. We need in particular the links mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) between industrialists and schools and industrialists and universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not given the hon. Lady too little time to say a few words in reply. Both of us wished to allow as many hon. Members as possible to get into the debate. I believe that we are united in our aims for education and I wish her and her right hon. Friend well in the open-ended discussions which are taking place. If there is anything which can be done from this side of the Committee to help those discussions, we shall be only too delighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the remarks of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) on the discussions we are about to have. I appreciate what he said. I hope that my hon. Friends who have asked particular questions, the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) and others, will not press me to go into further detail than that which I have given. I think it best to rest on what I have said this morning and, no doubt, we shall be able to give more detailed answers later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an extremely good debate because we have had many ideas and much enterprise shown by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in the subjects they have raised. It is quite clear that there is a general measure of agreement on a number of important fundamentals and a number of interesting ideas on the fringe subjects, which is as it should be in a debate of this kind. On the question of colleges of education, I undertook when I opened to give a little more information if needed. We are expecting a very considerable expansion in the total number of places available in the colleges over the next two or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has already been a large increase in the number of students seeking admission to the colleges to train as teachers and in the number of students in the colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
In 1958–59 the colleges had a total number of students of 4,425 and in this session the number has been 7,800. A great deal of credit is due to the colleges for the efforts they have made to avoid turning any student away and to maintain or get in as many as they could. Here I point to a difference between England and Scotland which affects the relative position. England has far more residential training college provision. We tend to have far more day students and, therefore, it is possible to accommodate more in a college because we do not have to provide the residential accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major building programme is already under way. Part of it has been completed. Colleges at Ayr and Falkirk are built, open and in operation. Three additional colleges have been provided. There are replacements on a bigger scale of three more and extensions of others. The intention is to meet the Robbins Committee proposals so that by 1972 10,700 places should be available and in addition we should make some places available for in-service training of teachers. As matters stand, we think we can do it within this building programme and we are grateful to the colleges for all that they are doing to make this possible. The figures to which the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland referred did not include that part of the expenditure which comes from education authorities towards colleges of education, so the figures were not entirely reliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of colleges of education and the B.Ed. course and the relation between both and the universities with the two Secretaries of State, discussions with colleges of education are carried out by the universities themselves. This kind of relationship is entirely academic and is not the kind of thing in which the Government in any way intervenes. What happens is that in Aberdeen, for example, discussion goes on between the college of education and the university. There is no need to intervene, and the question of who would intervene is, therefore, irrelevant. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) may be valid, but it is not actually of moment in consideration of the B.Ed. course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of rural and Highland education was raised by the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
right hon. Member for Argyll and the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), no doubt, would also be grateful if I said something about it. This is an immensely difficult problem. I have thought about it a great deal. It is a worrying problem. One has two clear alternatives. One is to accept for children in rural and Highland areas a lower standard of education than for those in areas of more concentrated population. The other is to accept that there may be the same standard and face the consequences that must mean in the way of centralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say the consequences of centralisation because I am quite convinced, as I think most hon. Members are, that we must have schools of a certain size to provide the variety of courses needed if standards are to be as good in terms of variety for children in those areas as elsewhere. This becomes all the more important with the raising of the school-leaving age. Then we shall be concerned with far more children who need a wide range of courses in practical subjects and the need for a larger unit becomes all the more acute. I have said that we are asking the National Building Agency to look at the question of hostel provision. We must try to provide some compensation for children who have to go to schools at some distance from their homes. If they have to live away from home during the week we must try to make it possible for them to have the kind of advantages which other children have when they go to boarding schools. This must be a positive thing by which they can gain something which city children cannot have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always take fully into account all the views of the parents and of other bodies in the area. It is a sad decision whenever a decision has to be made to close a small school in a country area because of the need for centralisation. I hope hon. Members will agree that that decision is not made through any ruthless desire for efficiency or to cut down costs but because only in this way can we be sure that children in the country and more remote areas shall not get a worse deal than those in the cities and urban areas. That is my approach.

	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
I wish to say something further about the secondary courses which we shall need to provide. I listened with very great interest to everything said on this subject this morning and looked forward to reading it with even closer attention in HANSARD because a number of very good suggestions have been made. On most of them we are already acting or thinking or about to act. There is hardly one which has been mentioned on which there is not something under way at the ment. On the use of auxiliaries a great deal is under way. On the links with industry there is a lot to be said. A
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
problem here is that the kind of experience which we want to give children in industry very often runs the risk of contravening Ministry of Labour regulations. The Secretary of State and the Minister are considering the possibility of overcoming this difficulty. There is the legal position, and we hope we can overcome this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
