</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Mr. Steele, for your suggestion to discuss these Amendments together. That is not only for the convenience of the Committee, but essential for a proper understanding of the intention of the various Amendments. At first glance, they look like drafting Amendments, but, as I shall show, they are much more than that and are of considerable substance. As they would bring about considerable amendment of the principal Act as well as of the Bill I hope I may be forgiven if I describe the penalty provisions of the principal Act, otherwise it is almost impossible to understand what I mean.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
Under the principal Act of 1951, there are roughly three classes of offence: offences against Section 22, offences under Section 28 and a third type of offence against byelaws. The question of offences against byelaws is not relevant to my argument and I propose to say no more about it.<br><br>
There is, however, a great difference in quality between offences under Section 22 and those under Section 28. The former are what I describe as being in the nature of continuing offences. The principal Act refers, for example, to a person who
<br><blockquote><p>"causes or knowingly permits to enter a stream any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter".</p></blockquote>
That is something which a person might not only do, but continue to do for a considerable time. Obviously, if a person does it for a considerable time after being warned about the offence, he is aggravating his original offence. It seems right and proper that in such circumstances the penalty should become greater the longer the offence is committed.<br><br>
On the other hand, an offence under Section 28 is a once and for all offence and consists of bringing a new effluent into operation. Section 28 of the principal Act commences by stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to this section, no person shall without the consent of the river purification authority (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) bring into use any new or altered outlet for the discharge of trade or sewage effluent to a stream".</p></blockquote>
As hon. Members will appreciate, something can be brought into operation only once. It might be done again at a subsequent date, but it is not a continuing offence. It is a once and for all offence and once a person has been convicted of it, he has tholed his assize and cannot be charged with repeating it. It is not a continuing offence like offences under Section 22.<br><br>
In the Bill we find that a new offence is committed under Clause 1. It is declared to be unlawful after a certain date
<br><blockquote><p>"to make a discharge of trade or sewage effluent to a stream".</p></blockquote>
This is not a new event; something which has been in effect for some time is being continued. It may be continued for some years. This is in the nature of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
a continuing offence analogous to offences under Section 22 of the principal Act. So that if a person has a discharge of old standing and he is refused consent by the river purification authority to continue that discharge he is aggravating the offence the longer he carries on doing it. Thus, this is not a once and for all offence such as an offence under Section 28 of the principal Act.<br><br>
Whichever Minister is responsible has treated an offence under the Bill in exactly the same way as an offence under Section 28 of the original Act. The proposal of subsection (7) is simple and straightforward. It states that
<br><blockquote><p>"A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be liable—<i>(a)</i> on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £500, or <i>(b)</i> on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £100."</p></blockquote>
There it stops. The Clause contains no provision for an increased penalty on continuation of the offence which would form an aggravation of the offence and which would appear to deserve an increased penalty the longer it continues.<br><br>
If a person commits an offence under the Clause and has been convicted and fined £500, or whatever is the appropriate figure, he has tholed his assize and it seems that he can go on gaily committing the offence without fear of further prosecution. It seems to me that that is quite wrong and that the Bill would be much strengthened if this offence were not dealt with in this way but declared to be an offence under Section 22 of the principal Act. That is the effect of the first of my Amendments. The Under-Secretary of State will, I think, agree that it would strengthen the Bill, because it would strengthen the hands of the river purification authority in dealing with an offender who was refractory and continued the offence.<br><br>
My proposal, therefore, is that such an offence should not be dealt with as a single offence but should be brought within Section 22 of the principal Act, so that if the person committing the offence continues to do so he will come under the continuing penalty provisions of Section 22 of the principal Act and the longer he does it, the greater will be the penalty.<br><br>
I do not quarrel with the amount of penalty which is proposed. A serious
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
offence might be committed under the Bill and in certain circumstances a serious penalty would be appropriate. Indeed, in corresponding English legislation there is no limit to the fine which may be imposed. I do not agree with that, and I think that the Under-Secretary is right to stipulate an upper limit. I have no quarrel with his fixing it at £500 for a serious offence. In case anyone has doubt about the appropriateness of that amount, I point out that the penalty of £500 would apply only in a case sufficiently serious to be tried on indictment. There must be a tremendous variety in the seriousness of these offences from, say, effluent from a simple domestic septic tank, which would be a comparatively minor offence, to a heinous offence which might call for the extreme penalty of £500.<br><br>
Where I quarrel with the Under-Secretary is the method by which he amends the previous legislation. I have pointed out that under the principal Act two separate types of offence are dealt with under Sections 22 and 28. In producing the Bill, however, the hon. Gentleman has made it extremely difficult, not only for lawyers but for river purification authorities, to see what the law is. He does not make it clear at first glance that he is materially increasing the penalties for offences under the original Act. I have no quarrel with subsection (7) of the Clause, in which the penalty is increased to £500, but my immediate reaction was whether the penalty for an offence under the principal Act was being correspondingly increased. It took me a long time to find out, because the penalties under the original Act are being increased in two places.<br><br>
First, in Clause 7(1) the Under-Secretary proposes to increase the penalty under Section 28 of the principal Act to exactly the same level as in Clause 1(7). I then wondered what the hon. Gentleman was doing about Section 22 of the principal Act and, again, I had to go to great trouble to find out. It took me a long time to discover that he is dealing with Section 22 in Clause 9(1). From the viewpoint of everybody who administers the Bill, whether a river purification authority, a lawyer or a judge, I do not regard it as fair that a person should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
burdened with the necessity of looking at different Clauses of the same Measure to find exactly the same thing applying to previous legislation.<br><br>
I suggest to the Under-Secretary that it would be convenient, not only to himself, but to all concerned, if he could bring all these increases in penalty into one Clause in the Bill, so that anybody reading it could see the penalty position at a glance without searching through the whole of a fairly major, long and difficult Bill. For that reason, my Amendments suggest the striking out of Clause 7(1) and Clause 9(1) and the incorporation of those two subsections in Clause 1(7) in the way I have suggested. If this were done, the Bill would be much clearer. I am not criticising the drafting. I am simply making a constructive suggestion to make the Bill much more convenient to all concerned.<br><br>
One other point in the various Amendments which is rather difficult to follow is my substitution of a series of figures for the figures in the principal Act. My reason for this is that the continuing penalties in the principal Act have not been increased in the same proportion as the original penalties. If the penalties for the original offence are being increased from, say, £200 to £500, in my opinion it would be right and proper that the continuing penalties—for aggravation of offences—should be increased in approximately the same proportion. I have discussed this with the Under-Secretary and I believe that he appreciates the point.<br><br>
Having explained the Amendments, I suggest that, complicated though they seem, they would be for the convenience of those who administer the Bill and would strengthen the hands of river purification authorities in putting the Bill into operation.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mahon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the whole Committee are obliged to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) who took enormous trouble to go through this matter. As I see it, there are three problems which face us on these Amendments. First of all, I would concede right away that there is a lack of clarity in the position as it is expressed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
at the moment in the Bill. Therefore, I would agree that it would be better if we could so rephrase the Bill—without necessarily changing the substance of any of the points in it—that it would be clearer. I make that point to the hon. Gentleman right away.<br><br>
The second argument which he used was that if we were to agree to this argument of clarity, whereabouts in the Bill would it be best to go in? The has decided to make a suggestion, a reasonable suggestion, which is not, however, in our view the best one that might be given. I think he might agree with us that later on, rather than make a reference in Clause 1, it would better, when we come to Clauses 7 and 9, to look at these penal provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
In relation to the previous Amendment, the Government here are prepared to be guided by the Committee because there is a balance of argument either way. This may be an extraordinary doctrine, but I think that it is worthwhile. We can test it and see whether it has any future. The burden of the argument is to show that these penal provisions have not been adequate deterrents or deterrents at all. There is no evidence either way. Therefore, the question of whether they have been large enough or small enough in the past, in the opinion of the Government, is not relevant. There has been only one prosecution. As I said on Second Reading, this could be a criticism of the river purification boards rather than of the principal Act itself, or it might be an actual praising of the boards, in that they have not had to resort to prosecutions, but have been successful in persuasion. There really are no arguments of substance in relation to the operation of the principal Act in this regard.<br><br>
The reason why in this Bill we are increasing the fine over that of the principal Act is the drop in the value of money. We are not responsible for that, but we must recognise the facts of life. The value of money has dropped, and, therefore, we are suggesting that we should increase this fine. Where it becomes illogical is that we are not increasing the value of subsequent fines for recurring or continuing offences. What we are proposing this morning is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
already the position under the English law. We would, therefore, be changing our position if we were to adopt the suggestion of the hon. Gentleman. That may or may not be a good argument, for or against.<br><br>
I suggest it can be useful if the Government listen to the burden of the argument one way and the other, and then determine what would be the best line to take. If the hon. Gentleman does withdraw these Amendments, the Government will submit at a later stage proper Amendments to Clauses 7 or 9 to meet his point of clarity. Also, we will in accordance with what the Committee express this morning, decide whether or not we should raise the subsequent fines or keep them at the level suggested in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has just said. I wonder if he is putting too much stress upon holding rigidly to the provisions of the English Act. As one goes through it one finds various radical aspects within it, and I think that this is one where validity would seem to be with my hon. Friend in departing from the English Act.<br><br>
I am not so much concerned about the penalty imposed for violation of the provisions of the Act but with the simplification of the Act, so that ordinary people like myself can understand it. I am attracted to the point of which the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) spoke, that there should be a general simplification of the Clause so that people can understand the Bill's implications. I would ask the Government to give further consideration to that, at a later date if not this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) said that he had had certain consultations or friendly chats, and he seemed by them to have converted my hon. Friend. This is all the better in this instance, because I am in agreement with most of the points which the hon. Gentleman made on these Amendments. I am quite convinced that in many instances where there is a good case prosecutions should have taken place, but did not take place. They were cases where rivers were being polluted very badly and be-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
coming impossible for everybody, especially for angling clubs, to create facilities or hold on to facilities on which they had spent a great deal of money. I have expressed this viewpoint before and I have known cases of pollution where no prosecution took place. Why did not prosecution take place? I believe that if we make this new Bill—which ultimately will become an Act—simpler we shall be doing a good thing.<br><br>
I also would support strongly the proposal that we agree to the general suggestions made by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West about repeated offences, that we should increase the penalties. I am strongly in favour of the suggestions which he has made in Amendment 20 in this connection. I feel that he is bringing the Bill more up to date in this regard, instead of leaving the position as it was in 1951. I think that the previous Government were lacking at that time in instituting these very low penalties for severe offences or repetition of offences. They should certainly, before this Committee took a look at the position, have indicated to the Scottish Members of Parliament, in an amending Bill of some character, that they were concerned to make certain that the offences were being considered and that the fines and penalties imposed would be relatively greater in connection with the needs of the age in which we live.<br><br>
I sense that the greatest Act of conversion here has already taken place outside the Committee. Nevertheless, as my hon. Friend wants to collect the voices, I would throw in mine for what it is worth in bringing in the increased penalties, simplifying the Bill and making it easier to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is only one point which the Under-Secretary of State has not dealt with and that is my suggestion that an offence under this Bill is more analogous to an offence under Section 22 than under Section 28. I do not ask him to answer that now but to bear it in mind. In view of the undertaking he has given I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 77, in page 3, line 3, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>Provided that in any proceedings in respect of an alleged failure to comply with any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
such conditions it shall be a defence to show that the failure was due to accident or other unforeseen circumstances, or could not reasonably have been foreseen.</p></blockquote>
I am grateful to you for calling this Amendment, Mr. Steele, as it is a starred Amendment.<br><br>
I may have made an error about the place at which to introduce these words. It may well be that the first words of subsection (8) are sufficient protection for people who, by some unforeseen accident, make a discharge and thereby pollute a stream. There have been reports of this sort of thing in the Press and in the reports of the river purification boards. There have been cases where a sewer has burst because of hard, frosty weather and this has caused pollution. There is a case in the report of the River Forth Board; children picked up a tin of sheep dip, threw it into a stream, used it as a target, punctured it, and thereby polluted the stream. It would appear that the neighbouring farmer should have been the responsible person, but, upon investigation, it was found that it was, in fact, another party who was responsible for this pollution case.<br><br>
It is for this sort of case that I think it would be right to make the Amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will let us know if this safeguard is already contained in the wording of the Clause and, if not, would he say if he would accept this Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give an assurance to the hon. Gentleman that in the opinion of the Government this is covered. It would seem that, that being so, it would only be repetition.<br><br>
However, if we were to accept the Amendment, we might create a rather difficult situation. I give this illustration. If a third party was the cause of one of these accidents, it would be very unlikely that the Crown would prosecute; but if the Crown did prosecute, the provisions of this Bill are such that it would be regarded, in our view, as a technical offence. Of course, this is entirely up to the court. One cannot anticipate what action the court would take, but it would seem that under these provisions, this would be so.<br><br>
If we were to incorporate this as an actual prescription of defence for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
court to consider there might be a situation where an accident occurred which might have been prevented if there had been a proper system of inspection. In other words, the failure to have a proper system of inspection could be regarded as the reason, under this Bill, for the offence having been committed. Not all dischargers fail to have proper inspection systems—and I am talking of large undertakings—but some do. This Amendment might give these dischargers a defence to which the court, in other circumstances, might not consider them entitled.<br><br>
I would strongly suggest to the Committee that we do not accept this Amendment. I should like to give the assurance that, in any reasonable situation, a defence could be offered to the court, and the court would have it in its discretion to decide one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that my hon. Friend was perfectly correct in indicating that it would be wrong to put this in the Bill. I cannot envisage an occasion when a river purification board would be prepared to institute proceedings against a person in circumstances such as the hon. Gentleman has indicated. I think that it would be wrong to put in this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to keep the Committee very long as the Government are being remarkably reasonable this morning, and I do not want to interfere with that. The only point I am slightly worried about is that my hon. Friends are trying to improve the Bill and trying to prevent, as the Government realised, action being taken against somebody for something which was not his fault. I see the hon. Gentleman's point about failure to inspect a system, perhaps leading to the breakdown, but I think that my hon. Friends have tried to cover that by the words "could not reasonably have been foreseen." I think that it would be of help to the Committee if we were to get the advice of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), who is our law officer on this Committee and who could, perhaps, assure us that, in the context of this Bill, these cases would not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
be likely to come before the court, and that if they did they would be considered simply as technical offences.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two limbs to the opening words of subsection (8).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that there is no money here involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two limbs. The first is "No person shall cause" and the second is "or knowingly permit".<br><br>
The Under-Secretary was perfectly right: a person could be deemed to have caused something, even if he had not done it in a positive sense, but what had happened had occurred through negligence or carelessness on his part. In that case it would be perfectly competent to bring proceedings. The third party interference in the example given by my hon. Friend could not possibly come in on either of the two limbs. Unless these drums were going down as a matter of practice and nothing was being done to stop them, that would not come in on the "cause" part, and unless he had knowledge of what was going on and permitted the offence, the individual concerned could not be said to have knowingly permitted the offence to be committed. I agree that there is no need for the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are delighted to have had that advice and I am sorry that the hon. and learned Gentleman could not tender it to his hon. Friends in other places. That would have saved us all this trouble. I am very glad that he agrees with us. If he wishes to continue his career as Solicitor-General for Scotland, there is always a place for him on this side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is another valid consideration which ought not to be completely ignored. Like an earlier Amendment, this Amendment would improve the Bill and make it more palatable to those whose co-operation is so necessary if the Bill is to be effectively operated. I should like to point out, particularly to the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), who sometimes assumes that when one tries to make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
improvements like this and to encourage the securing of co-operation to make the Bill more effective, one is trying to undermine the Bill, that that is far from the case and that it is vital that we should have as many people as possible voluntarily co-operating in making the Bill thoroughly effective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that he is asking the impossible? He could not possibly make effluent palatable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be the hon. Gentleman's view, but any way in which the Bill can be made more palatable should be followed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has been said, on both sides of the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 10, after "power", to insert "under the principal Act".<br><br>
This is purely a drafting Amendment. The Clause attempts to define a discharge which is not controlled by Section 28 and describes a discharge in relation to which a river authority has no power. When the Bill is passed, a river purification authority will have power, so that the provision becomes meaningless. The wording would be improved if the Amendment were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that, having had to go through all the Acts of Parliament which have been concerned with this subject from time to time, the hon. Member will have fallen into some misunderstanding, despite the learned advice which he has at his elbow and which he can provide himself. In this case there are no powers other than those in section 28 of the 1951 Act to control new outlets and new discharges of trade or sewage effluent to streams. That being so, the Amendment would serve no purpose and I counsel the hon. Gentleman not to pursue it, because it would add nothing to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree, but I do not want to press the matter and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 16, to leave out "fourteen" and to insert "twenty".<br><br>
I appreciate that this part of the Bill follows the wording of the equivalent English legislation—the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961. That contained the figure of 14 for the number of months in not less than which the date should be selected after the passage of the Bill. In practice, what happened in England and Wales was that the Bill was passed on 27th July, 1961, and the date selected by the appropriate Minister was 1st June, 1963, about 23 months after the passage of the Bill, although the Bill had said that the date should not be less than 14 months.<br><br>
I know that hon. Members opposite as well as my hon. Friends follow the principle that we do not slavishly pursue what is done in English legislation, but try to learn from the experience of such legislation. Besides appealing to the Under-Secretary, I appeal to his hon. Friend the Minister of State who on Second Reading spoke to this effect. Certainly I remember his voicing this view many times in the last Parliament. I know that he has been remarkably silent in our proceedings so far, but I do not connect that with the remarkable reasonableness with which my right hon. Friend has characterised the Government on the Bill so far. I appeal to the hon. Gentleman, because I know that he has strong views about not slavishly following English legislation, but learning from English experience.<br><br>
Timing will affect all those who were discharging trade and sewage effluents in 1951 and are still doing so—industries, agricultural communities and others. The industries are likely to be large concerns on the whole—anyway, larger than small farms—and they will probably have some experience of dealing with effluents. Again, the special problem which arises will be that of the farm, and especially of the small or medium-sized farm.<br><br>
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland has made it clear in a letter which it circulated to all Scottish Members that it would like the figure to be 24 months. We have suggested 20 months. For reasons which I deployed earlier and which concern the special difficulties of some farms, I believe it to be important to consider the timing.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
When the English legislation was going through the House of Commons the English National Farmers' Union produced views similar to those of its Scottish counterpart. It welcomed the Bill and said that it was in the interests of the farming community as a whole that rivers should be clean, but that special problems would arise on some farms. In particular, it drew attention to the effluent from silage pits and the effluent produced in the course of livestock farming. It stressed that research and guidance rather than possible prosecutions seemed to be a more helpful and realistic manner in which to approach some of these problems.<br><br>
I mention that because we can look back at the experience of the English Act. The information given to me indicates that it has been working fairly smoothly in England and Wales because it came into operation 23 months after the passage of the Act. In many cases there has been imagination in not dealing too quickly with applicants with special difficulties. The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) will understand the kind of difficulties I have in mind. In passing, I refer to a booklet giving technical advice to farmers in England and Wales. Hon. Members will see from that how much there is in the way of new techniques and new questions for farmers who will be affected by the Bill, quite apart from the difficulty for industry and others which I mentioned earlier.<br><br>
The representative bodies in Scotland whose views we have so far managed to collect seem to have this in common—that they welcome the Bill in principle and feel that the timing will be important. This is because if those who are affected do not feel that they are being rushed off their feet there is every chance that the general good will towards the Bill can be harnessed. If they feel that they are being hustled, there is a danger of their being antagonised and feeling that the Bill is working against their interests and not helping towards something which must clearly be for the good of the community as a whole.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Gentleman said on Tuesday and may say again today that the Bill was prepared while my right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
hon. Friend and I were at the Scottish Office and that we are therefore now proposing changes to a Bill for which we take some responsibility. However, surely we are at liberty to suggest what we believe to be improvements. We feel that these considerations should not be inhibited because we ourselves were responsible for the first draft of the Bill. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Spray Irrigation Act, the last water resources measure for Scotland, which went through at the end of the last Parliament, was our Bill, but that we were ready and prepared to consider and accept suggestions from hon. Members opposite who were then in Opposition and also to make our own improvements as the Bill went through. Those hon. Members who assiduously worked on the Floor of the House of Commons when we discussed that Bill in Committee for many hours—I do not see any present at the moment—will remember that we were ready to make improvements to that Measure in the same way that we now feel free to improve this.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may also say that the number of months does not matter, because the position is held by Clause 2 which protects the position of applicants while their applications are being considered. However, that argument works in the reverse direction, too. If in any case those who have applied by a certain date are not at that stage affected till their application has been dealt with and their position is held, there seems to be no particular point in making the date any earlier than it need be if that has the effect of hustling some of those concerned, who have to learn in the first place about the technical difficulties connected with dealing with effluent and then to put in their applications. There is much to be said for making the figure larger and making it 20 and not 14 months.<br><br>
I hope that I have made clear the reasons for moving the Amendment. I trust that in the light of the English experience and what they did the Government will look carefully at the matter and will accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that in the rest of our proceedings I will not make any reference to the parentage of this child.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
I am sorry if I wounded the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) the other day by making this point. I accept straight away the assurance of my predecessor in office that hon. Members opposite would have made changes in the Bill and that this probably would have been one of them. I concede that we must take all their Amendments in the same light and accept that probably all would have been made in the Bill as a Government Bill, and that therefore all our resistance to their Amendments would have been in reverse, and that our Amendments, were the country so unfortunate to have us as an Opposition and not as a Government, would have been Opposition Amendments. That disposes of many of the remonstrances of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), who claims that we are only making the same speeches in reverse. I am glad immediately to dispel that unfortunate impression, to which I have contributed. I admit that that is wrong, and I will not use that argument again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In case there is any misunderstanding, I should point out that some of the Amendments on the Notice Paper are probing Amendments. What I was saying was that we cannot accept the position which the hon. Gentleman indicated at our last meeting that we should be inhibited from suggesting improvements from the Front Bench on this side simply because the first draft of the Bill was prepared under our responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. However, the hon. Gentleman is very modest when he infers that this is a probing Amendment. Clearly it is not. This is an Amendment of substance. I understand why he wishes to dissociate himself from some of the Amendments which may be moved from the back benches opposite, and I would not necessarily halter either of these two—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to some of my own later Amendments, which are probing Amendments. I thought that I had made it clear that this Amendment was not a probing Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. Our only division so far in this otherwise amicable Committee has been on an Amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
which, in our view, would have weakened the Bill. If the Bill had taken the form which hon. Members opposite desired, we should have had to attack it, and probably have a Division on our part.<br><br>
This is an important Amendment on which we cannot give way. I cannot accept it. As an innocent onlooker and simply as a student of politics, I counsel hon. Members opposite that if they base their Amendments largely on agricultural illustrations people will regard them as the agrarian party. There are industrial arguments in support of this Amendment with which I should have liked to deal, but since they have not been raised, I cannot do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I say, hon. Members opposite are in danger of becoming the farmers' party rather than the party of the nation, which they may have been at one time, but certainly are not today. I am sorry, Mr. Steele, if I have drifted away from the Amendment, but the theme is running in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right on the ball.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.<br><br>
A good advocate presents a good case with a bad brief, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) on doing that. However, when one examines the brief a little more closely, what does one find? First, the argument is that we should do this because everything has worked very well in England. But that is based on what? It is based on the provisions in the Bill. We are rehearsing the position in England in the Bill. Therefore, if the English position worked successfully in the last Bill, surely the Scottish position will work successfully in this Bill.<br><br>
The other point was that under the English Act, there was, somehow, an extension by the Minister. That is the simple point—that many of the arguments used by the hon. Gentleman are very pertinent perhaps to agriculture and certainly to industry. The Secretary of State would have to be very careful in making up his mind about the balance of time. He has power to issue an order. The phrase is "not less", which means that he does not have to stick to exactly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
14 months. It could be 14, 15, 16 or 20 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or 23 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or 33 if need be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is here to support me, and he has done very well so far. He has kept restraining me. Hon. Members do not know how valuable he has been to the Government. As he said in his intervention, the Secretary of State has this right.<br><br>
This is the argument of the Government—that it is the Secretary of State who, as custodian of the public good, would make this decision. But what would happen if we wrote the Amendment in the Bill? We should not be helping the Secretary of State, because under the Bill he is not in need of help in this regard. But we should be helping the discharger. I am surprised to find hon. Members opposite consistently doing this. In their efforts to help small farmers and septic tank dischargers, they seem to be striving to divert this legislation from its main purpose, which must be to deal with industry. While I regret that we cannot divorce this, it is fair for us to complain that hon. Members opposite must not push on us with tremendous conviction Amendments which will defeat the Bill's object.<br><br>
May I say in passing that it was a Labour Government which introduced the principal Act, but that it was a Conservative Government which was enjoined in the stewardship of that Act for 13 years about which Conservatives and Socialists have been complaining. I concede that spray irrigation is important, especially to farmers, but in passing the second Measure it is very important that we make it as strong as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue this arid and ridiculous argument. The purpose of the spray irrigation Measure was to prevent farmers from taking water out of rivers and thereby damaging the interests of other people who lived farther down the rivers. This obsession, that the only people in whom we on this side are interested are farmers, is boring and inaccurate.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We dealt with the Spray Irrigation Act in the last Session.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele. I was tempted to intervene by the ridiculous remarks of the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the right hon. Gentleman fell, because the illustration is quite a good one—that the only thing done was in relation to agriculture. Even though it seemed to be penal on farmers, it was ultimately of help to the farming industry. However, I will leave that point.<br><br>
I am making this simple point because hon. Members opposite have an obsession about the position, not of industrial discharges, but of farming discharges. The hon. Member earlier spoke about how the discharger was protected and therefore that it was, in a sense, I suppose, ridiculous not to give way on this matter. The fact is that there could be a discharger who would wait until the very last minute or perhaps take a chance and not apply for consent, which would mean another six months of procrastination. In other words, the Amendment, at best, will add nothing to the Bill, and, at worst, could delay its operation. It would weaken the Bill's effect and I therefore counsel my hon. Friends to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In rising to make a speech for the first time in this Committee I would crave the indulgence of hon. Members. I have not had enough experience to know whether one should be controversial or not on such an occasion.<br><br>
I should like to take up a point made by the Under-Secretary of State about the agricultural industry. I would remind him that it is the most productive and progressive industry in the nation. We who represent farming constituents have a right and duty to put before the Committee the facts as we see them.<br><br>
I understand that it is usual to declare an interest. I am a farmer. I farm on the banks of the Deveron, in Banffshire. Like many other northern counties, Banff has a great deal of fertile land in the river valleys, which often are extremely steep.<br><br>
There are two problems which the farmers face: first, free drainage, and, secondly, burns flowing into rivers, such as the Deveron, into which flow tile
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
drains. The Committee may not realise that in some cases the altitude drops from 700 to 300 ft. in as short a distance as a quarter of a mile. That is a considerable drop: hence, the problem of free drainage.<br><br>
Last week, the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) reminded us farmers that it would be a good thing if we put back on the ground some of the effluent which we created in our farming practice. I would agree with that. But the point with these free drainage areas is that effluent will go back into the main rivers and we shall be faced with the enormous problem of catching the outflow, not only from tile drains, but from burns before they enter the river.<br><br>
I have no fewer than five burns on the narrow strip of land which I farm. In some way, they must be harnessed. There is not only surface water from the burns, but surface water from the fields to which I have referred as free drainage. There is not only the financial problem with which we have already dealt, but, in some ways, the graver problem of harnessing all this water in the short time which the Bill allows. That is why I support the Amendment.<br><br>
In many cases, a considerable amount of work will have to be done, and the Committee must face this realistically. No one will take action till the Bill becomes an Act. If we are to put large schemes into operation it will interfere with our farming year and programmes, as we lay them down in advance. All this will take time, and for this reason I support the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene in the debate because I was becoming a little concerned about the heat being engendered between the two Front Benches. I should not like to see any discord or disharmony over a Measure on which there is so much general agreement.<br><br>
However, I should like to comment on the Amendment. I am, to some extent, reassured by your comments—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not by my comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Steele—by my hon. Friend's comments, and the fact that the period of not less than 14 months is laid down in the Clause, which gives a certain amount of latitude to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
Secretary of State and, generally speaking, meets the principles of the Amendment. However, I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends not only to have regard to the necessity of not looking at this matter in a jaundiced or bigoted light, but to bear in mind the simple physical facts of the position in which a person who makes an application finds himself.<br><br>
We as a Government are endeavouring to build as many houses, schools and factories as possible. Many of the engineers and building constructors working on small projects either for farmers or industrialists will be fully engaged and employed. This erects a physical barrier to anybody who wants to meet the requirements of the Measure. I know that under Clause 2 once the application is made to the river purification authority it is tantamount to its being under consideration and that no prosecutions would be effective, but this puts an onus of responsibility on the industrialist, farmer, or whoever he may be, to get a building contractor to prepare plans and, sometimes, to get the consent of the planning authority. This takes a long time. I say sincerely that with the restriction to 14 months, the practical application of the Clause will be almost a physical impossibility.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
While we have our disagreements, I regret that this matter should be regarded in any party fashion. When matters such as this come into the Committee, no political principle is involved. Most of us are mindful of our responsibility to keep our rivers clean and to ensure their purification. I have served on a board where differences of opinion politically were evident outside but we tried our utmost to operate the provisions of the 1951 Act. I counsel my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to bear in mind that when applications are put before him or his right hon. Friend, the time stipulated in the Bill will make it a physical impossibility to accomplish what we desire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by apologising on behalf of British Railways for my absence on Tuesday. The railway line from Scotland was polluted with motor cars. I support my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) in what they have said on the Amendment, particularly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
from the viewpoint of industry as well as of agriculture. I declare my interest as a farmer.<br><br>
We in the south-west have had the Solway River Board in operation for 10 years, which is rather longer than most boards in Scotland have been functioning. I have with me a copy of the board's report. It stresses how, by reasonable action, it has obtained co-operation with both industry and agriculture, particularly because it has never asked for a high standard as a matter of form but has taken all factors into account, particularly amenity.<br><br>
There is, however, no way of avoiding the fact that this has cost a great deal of money, particularly to industry. In my home town of Langholm, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) knows, there was considerable difficulty with the tweed mills and the River Esk. Only by a very reasonable attitude, by taking as much time as possible and by general co-operation, was the strong possibility avoided of two of the mills closing down and removing to another country. That would have caused serious unemployment to a town which has all its eggs in one basket. I therefore stress that time is of the greatest importance. We cannot be certain that all river boards will act with the same reasonable attitude as has been the case in the Solway area.<br><br>
I wish also to put in an important word about the physical difficulties from the view point of agriculture. In my part of the world, we have a high rainfall, not necessarily the highest in Scotland, thank goodness, but an average of between 45 and in 80 in. a year. This means that it is impossible to tow tanker trailers about the fields in winter spreading various effluents as suggested under the Bill. On many occasions, it is virtually impossible with waterlogged fields even to take a tractor, certainly not with a heavy trailer. We have, therefore, to consider the practical difficulties of farmers in the wetter districts. In a dairying area, we want as much time as possible to solve the practical difficulties of the silage pit.<br><br>
We are often reminded that we get grants for this service of providing the various forms of solution, but let it be remembered that in agriculture we get only one-third grant. This means that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
two-thirds still has to be found by the farmer. On a £1,000 project, for example, the farmer must still find about £670, which is a great deal of money at this time. Talking about tanker trailers reminds me that there is no grant for implements.<br><br>
I support my hon. Friend in saying that we need more time to solve the practical difficulties and more time to approach our benevolent bank managers, because this will be as big a difficulty as the practical one. I support the proposal to increase the time limit from 14 to 20 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that there is any necessity for it from the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary but in view of the many speeches which are being made in support of the Amendment there might be a chance that my hon. Friend will weaken. I am not a farmer. I want to return to the purpose of the Bill, which is to have clean rivers and not pre-eminently the interests of which the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) spoke.<br><br>
The hon. Member said that certain interests had been consulted. I should like to know what those interests were. Most of those who have followed the hon. Member have spoken solely of the interests of agriculture and of the farmer. No one has a healthier respect for farmers, although I happen to have none in my constituency, than I have, but I think that the situation is being exaggerated. The hon. Member raised his own defences and pointed out that the Bill originated from his party. He then twitted my hon. Friend the Minister of State about following in the footsteps of England. There is no doubt that that was what the former Government did. It was only because the English Bill had been passed and the Scottish Advisory Council noted that fact belatedly, that representations were then made to the Government. We certainly are slavishly following England. The previous Administration took no initiative in this matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) asked for more time. The previous Administration had 10 years in which to implement the principal Act. If we are anxious about clean
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
rivers, how much longer are we to wait? It was only about a year ago that the last river board was formed, 10 years after the passing of the Act.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has pointed out that the language of the subsection is "not less than fourteen months". The interpretation of that phrase is sufficiently wide to meet the point which has been made by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn. The hon. Member has described it as a probing Amendment. I hope that we are not to be faced at the end of this discussion with another invitation by the hon. Member for my hon. Friend to reassure the Committee. That would be going too far when my hon. Friend has given any reassurance that is necessary. The claim is made that reasonable time must be allowed. The nation and the Committee have been most reasonable in waiting for the implementation of the Act. Since the Bill is claimed to go a little further and to strengthen the position, I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will resist the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words in support of the Amendment, particularly concerning the problems of industry in the Glasgow area. Had Scottish industrialists listened to the Under-Secretary of State and to what was said in this Committee they would be confused about the need for urgency.<br><br>
Let me mention three facts about the River Clyde affecting Glasgow. For eight or ten miles down stream from Glasgow Cross the Clyde is devoid of oxygen in dry weather. Sewage matter from the centre of Glasgow takes from five to eight days to go down to Erskine Bridge. Untreated sewage from one million people goes direct into the tidal stretches of the Clyde. In these circumstances, industrialists wonder what is the great urgency to try to get clean water in the Clyde. If you hope to look forward to the time when it is a pure fresh stream, you are living in cloud-cuckoo land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not living in any cuckoo land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member see the inevitable line of his argument? Are we to delay the purification
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
of rivers? The whole programme cannot be based upon the state of one stream. We want to move ahead, and we in Ayrshire cannot let Glasgow, the Clyde or anywhere else keep up back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Steele, for my incorrect style. My reply to the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) is that the Clyde is not a stream.<br><br>
The difference of a few extra months could be of great assistance to industrialists on the Clyde. In this area, they cannot possibly see the great urgency to push forward, because for the Clyde this will not make a great deal of difference.<br><br>
The argument which can be advanced against the Amendment is that the 14 months' time limit did not cause a great deal of trouble in England and that there is no need for Scotland to be different. That is a valid argument in theory, but the essential difference in Scotland is that the industries principally affected are those which can least afford the money required to adapt themselves to the new situation. Looking through the reports of almost every board in the central belt of Scotland, one finds that the firms affected are those which are not doing well, which are not prosperous and which do not seem to have enormous resources to spend in this way. The essentials for obtaining the co-operation of industry, whilst at the same time keeping it in existence, are to facilitate the maximum co-operation and to allow the maximum of time.<br><br>
I was surprised to hear it suggested that we had over-emphasised the needs of agriculture and not so much those of industry. If that is the case, there are several reasons for it. The main one is that we have been embarrassed into silence by the disregard of the problems of industry by hon. Members opposite in bringing the Bill forward. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Any attempts which we on this side have made to alleviate the problems of industry by moving Amendments to the Bill have been completely rejected by the party opposite.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
In addition, there is inconsistency in the application of the Bill. Under the Bill we are to ensure that in places such as Cathcart and Hillhead, which are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
already subject to tight control, there will be even tighter control over the discharge of industrial sewage. In these non-tidal stretches of the Clyde, which affect my constituency and Hillhead, the board already exercises tight control, and the Bill will make that control even tighter. We accept that we want cleaner water, but we cannot accept that this extra burden should be imposed on these areas when areas such as the Gorbals, Govan and West Renfrew are free from control—and special provisions are being included in the Bill whereby they shall continue to be completely free from control.<br><br>
What sense can it make when an industrialist on one side of a road, for example in Bridgeton, has to accept tighter control when across the road in the Gorbals there is complete absence of control? This makes no sense to industry, and for this reason we feel that we are not getting from the Government the co-operation to which we are entitled when we move Amendments, nor are we getting the support for industry which we are entitled to expect.<br><br>
Hon. Members opposite may feel that to a certain degree we are over-emphasising the needs of agriculture. The problem of river pollution for agriculture is far greater than might be seen from the immediate, automatic effects which arise. I do not know a great deal about agriculture, and I knew nothing about it before I came into Parliament, but I have been advised by someone who should know that the pollution arising from one silage tank could, in certain circumstances, be as significant as the pollution coming from sewage produced from a small burgh. In those circumstances, it is clear that if we are to introduce a Bill we must pay special attention to the problems of agriculture.<br><br>
I support the Amendment. Industry needs time to try to adjust itself to the new Measure. It needs time particularly in Scotland, because some of those affected are least able to pay the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The under-Secretary of State is probably now aware that we on this side of the Committee are as much concerned about industry as we are about agriculture. I endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) about industry situated in rural areas. The problems for such industry are particularly great in that there is not in those areas the same developed system of sewage disposal works under local authorities.<br><br>
The industry of which I wish to speak is the distilling industry, which is a most important industry not only to Scotland but to the Exchequer. The whisky industry has spent a tremendous amount of money and an enormous amount of laboratory research on the discharge of effluents. It has found that there are various methods, which it has developed, which can achieve an improvement in its effluent of about 85 to 90 per cent. without too great an expense. As long as the industry can get rid of the remaining 10 to 15 per cent. all is well, but the great problem of an industry such as distilling is how to dispose of the remaining 10 to 15 per cent. It is an extremely difficult and expensive item to purify. Unless it is accepted by the local authority that the industry can dispose of it, there can be great difficulty.<br><br>
One distillery in my constituency was faced with this problem. It was situated a considerable distance from the sea. The distillery has been trying to deal with the problem over a number of years. One difficulty is in relation to the local authority and finding exactly what responsibility the local authority has towards it because legislation in Scotland does not lay down exactly what responsibilities local authorities have and under exactly what conditions the local authority will accept the task. As a result, the negotiations over the disposal of effluent have been extremely prolonged. The distillery has spent a lot of money on research in trying to find how to purify the effluent. After many years it has reached the solution of driving the effluent by tanker twice a week and depositing it in a sewer which leads to the sea. This solution was reached after a matter of years. This is why it is important that we should support the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member accept that the distilling industry can be a success only if it has a clean, wholesome water supply? Can it afford to wait
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
on the upstream polluters, farmers or whoever they may be, who may be polluting the water which is then used to make excellent whisky? There is surely a degree of urgency to make a success of the industry and to ensure that it has a wholesome water supply. We want to try to deal with this urgently without injuring anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the point which the hon. Member makes is valid, but the point I made is also important. One of the ways in which we can attract industry to Scotland is by pointing out what we provide by natural resources and water supply and an ability to dispose of effluents such as this. In an industry which is using a lot of water there is inevitably a problem of effluent disposal. If we are to get new industries, including new distilleries, in the north-east of Scotland, which is very prominent in our minds, we must think of sewage disposal as well as of obtaining a clean water supply.<br><br>
For the bigger distillery companies and bigger concerns, and also for those distilleries near the sea, the problem is not as great. I understand that where they can work together in an area it is easier to dispose of the effluent or to set up plant to deal with it. The big problem is that of the smaller distilleries and smaller companies, which find this a very difficult problem involving a large increase in their on-costs. It takes time not only to find a suitable way of dealing with the effluent but also to negotiate with local authorities when they are prepared to accept responsibility. It is therefore important to support the Amendment and to extend the period from 14 to 20 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to sum up very quickly, because we have spent enough time on this Amendment. First, it is clear to those hon. Members who have been listening that although the same number of months was written into the Bill in England, in fact they had 23 months in practice to deal with the position.<br><br>
Secondly, I agree entirely with the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) that there is no political angle in this matter. It is a practical issue, and a good deal of what he said is true about the practical difficulties of getting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
these schemes into operation even in a period of 14 months. Like myself, he has had experience both of farming and of industry. For that reason we do not criticise the Secretary of State, who as far as I know, has had neither. It is probable that in due course the Secretary of State will be saying that 14 months from the date of the passing of the legislation is an impossibly short time for industry and for farming. Therefore, in practice 20 months, in the experience of all those who have written to us from all sides in Scotland, is sensible. I therefore suggest that it is practical and sensible for the Committee to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must disabuse the mind of the right hon. Member for Argyle (Mr. Noble) about the argument concerned with England. The appointed day in the English Act was 1st June, 1963, and the Act was brought into force under a Section similar to this Clause on 27th September, 1964, which is a period of 15 months.<br><br>
It would be quite right, following English experience, if the Secretary of State felt that 14 months were not long enough but that 15 months were long enough, for him to do this under the Clause. If it will take 20 months, as the Amendment suggests, the Secretary of State is entitled also to order 20 months. If it takes years, as the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said, when considering the difficulties in the whisky industry, the Secretary of State is entitled to order years.<br><br>
The argument is, therefore, not over the delay which the Secretary of State can achieve if the facts are for a delay. That is not the argument. That is safe guarded in the Bill. What is the argument? The argument is that we should write this into the Bill so that he cannot act within that period if he wants to do so. In other words, we may go slow if the facts tell us to do so but we dare not go fast. That is the Opposition's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I interrupt the hon. Gentleman only to give him time to consider this question. We must have an answer about these dates. I have here the English Act. Section 1(11) states that the date appointed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be such date as the Minister may by order appoint, being a date not less than fourteen months after the passing of this Act."</p></blockquote>
That is not when the Act came into operation. It was after the passing of the Act. The Act itself says that it became law on 27th July, 1961. I agree with the hon. Member about the date which The Minister appointed in June, 1963. That was the date which I gave, and which the Minister confirmed. But it is a difference between the two other dates, which is 23 months, and I do not see how a date in 1964 can have application here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The officials will supply me with the dates, but in fact I do not care what the answer is, because it does not change the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee thinks about this it will see that it does not affect the argument. Suppose the officials tell me that it was 23 months or 46 months for that date and the argument therefore follows that Scotland ought to have the same time as England. We have power to provide that in the Bill. That is not what the Amendment is about, and it is wrong of hon. Members opposite to confuse the issue in this way in order to get an advantage not for the Secretary of State or for the public good but for the dischargers. What we are trying to say is that we must allow for the fact that a discharger may cheat. Some of the dischargers may be tempted to cheat. The vast majority will not. But in order to try to get clean rivers we must have good and strong legislation, and the Amendment would weaken it.<br><br>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) on speaking for industry from the other side of the Committee—the only hon. Member to do so. I am not decrying those who have argued, as they have every right to argue, the case for agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not waste time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am simply saying that the hon. Member for Cathcart made an excellent speech, about the interests of industry, which was a long time coming from the Opposition. If his party had implemented the Hill Watson Report, much that he complains about would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
not exist today. His speech is an eloquent denunciation of his own party's inactivity for thirteen years, and it is unfair of him to complain that in our short period of office we have done nothing about the matters of which he complains.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that in the Bill he can extend the period for 10 years if need be. He does not realise, apparently, that industry would then depend entirely on his discretion. In other words, the only safeguard for industry would be that the Secretary of State would take this into account.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reflects for a moment he will see that the Secretary of State takes advice in this matter, not only from the river purification boards and the river purification authorities, but also from his advisory committee, which takes evidence, and from industry and agriculture and, of course, from the local authorities in relation to domestic effluent. He is, therefore, in a better position than anyone, with all these advisers, and has all the power at his disposal to make a decision. As far as I can see, hon. Gentlemen are not contesting the right of the Secretary of State to prolong the time. What they are arguing, which, I must emphasise to the Committee, is a very narrow point—would result in the discharger getting an extra period of six months and come along at the last minute. It may seem a small point, but it would weaken what is at the moment a strong Bill.<br><br>
On the question of the line taken, my only complaint was of the strong accent on agriculture, as if agriculture were the only concern of the Committee. It is the concern of the Government to make a natural balance between the three interests—of local authorities, industry, and agriculture. It is not fair to try to twist legislation to suit one particular interest. It has got to be fair for all, not just fair for some.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary of State then please say, if tweed mills and distilleries are not industry, what they are?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course they are industry. No one denies that for one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
moment. I would congratulate the hon. Member and his hon. Friend on having managed to interpolate this in their general argument.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) raised the question of land drainage. I welcome his first speech to the Committee, and I hope that his subsequent ones will be so reasonable. I have not managed to follow that pattern for some time—until I became a Minister, that is. Land drainage is not a matter within the Bill. Indeed, the hon. Member for Cathcart said in his Second Reading speech that that was the object. It was not. That was a matter which the previous Government completely ignored. I can give him an assurance on that. This is not covered. This is a question of trade effluent and not of land drainage.<br><br>
I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) that the Secretary of State must lay down these matters and must realise his powers under this Clause and use them—in the public interest and the interest of those industries and those parts of agriculture and, indeed, of those local authorities who think that this might be an unfair matter—to deal with it as speedily as he might wish. He has this power. The Committee must not weaken the Bill by accepting the Amendment and I hope that my hon. Friends and those reasonable hon. Gentlemen opposite will understand this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman been able to discover the information about 23 months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The information I have been given is that the Act was passed on 27th July, 1961. The appointed day was 1st June, 1963, and the operation of the Act began on 27th September, 1964.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the deduction is that it was 23 months between the Act and the appointed day and that it was 15 months between the appointed day and the operation of it. As the Secretary of State has the power to alter this by whatever means he pleases, we are confident that that will be so arranged. The Amendment is not relevant to this argument.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far from what the hon. Gentleman has just said about the period of 23 months detracting from our argument, it adds to it. We follow the lines of the English Measure and we have the advantage of seeing what actually happened after its passing, as the Minister of State so eloquently said in his Second</span></p>

(PROTECTION WHILE APPLICATIONS MADE BEFORE APPOINTED DATE<br><br> ARE BEING DEALT WITH.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In calling Amendment No. 25, I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee that we should take Amendments No. 26, in page 3, line 23, leave out from "Act " to "then" in line 24; No. 29, in line 37, leave out from "made" to "then" in line 38; and No. 30, in line 38, leave out "in pursuance of" and insert "under".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 25, in page 3, line 22, to leave out from "made" to "then" in line 24.<br><br>
In putting down the two Amendments in my name, I had two motives. The first has, unfortunately, fallen, because they were to some extent consequential on my first Amendment and the series of Amendments which went with that. On the other hand, the two Amendments have a separate purpose, which is improve the wording of the Bill and to delete wording which is, in my view, and, I think, in the view of the Minister of State, whose views we look forward to hearing in this Committee, completely tautological and unnecessary.<br><br>
Subsection (1) of this Clause speaks about an application for consent being made and it goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"before the date appointed under section 1 of this Act".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
Reading speech. Now, therefore, we should make this Amendment, which could be helpful to Scotland.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That "fourteen" stand part of the Clause:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 15, Noes 12.</p>
<p>If the application is made, it must be made before the date appointed by Section 1 of this Act. I should think the Minister of State would be the first to agree that unnecessary words of this kind should be cut out of the Bill.</p>
<p>The second part of my first Amendment is that if the application is not disposed of before that date, certain things will happen. It is perfectly obvious that a great many of these applications will not be disposed of before that date and there is provision for giving the purification authorities power to dispose of these applications. I suggest by the second part of my Amendment that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"and the application is not disposed of before that date"</p></blockquote>
are not only unnecessary but undesirable. My hon. Friends who have put down their own Amendments will probably want to speak on this subject also.</p>
<p>The second Amendment in my name is also intended to take out words which are completely unnecessary. If the application is made, it will be made before the appointed day and I am extremely glad to note that the Minister of State has himself taken exception to those horrible words "in pursuance of" and has an Amendment to substitute for them the word "under". I look forward very confidently to obtaining the consent of no less a person than the Minister of State in these two Amendments in my name.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would just like to explain the Amendment in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and myself, which is being taken with this group of Amendments. I must quickly tell the Under-Secretary of State that this is a probing Amendment, one of those to which I referred. It is, simply, to ask for an explanation of the structure of this Clause, because there is a repetition between subsection (1) and subsection (2), but these words appear in subsection (1) but not in subsection (2). I would, therefore, be glad to learn what the reasons are for this. I understand that repetition can be useful and can provide clarity in the drafting of difficult Clauses, so I am quite prepared to understand that a structure of this kind can, if one is searching among separate points and linking them up, often lead to clarity and be helpful, even though it appears to be repetitious. I would be grateful for an explanation of why the words appear in one part and not in the other of the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) has said that often, by repetition, things become more clear. Certainly, in this case, by retaining the words which he wants to leave out, by way of Amendment No. 26—and Amendment No. 25 reflects this—it is made clear to the applicant for consent that, by applying before the appointed day, his application may be disposed of before that date. If the words were left out that might not be so clear, and it is for that reason I suggest to both hon. Gentlemen that they do not press this Amendment.<br><br>
The effect of the other Amendment would be that those dischargers who did not apply till after the appointed day would be allowed to continue their discharge thereafter without committing an offence, and till decisions were reached on their applications for consent. This was designed to achieve the encouragement of early applications.<br><br>
If the whole thing is taken together, it will be seen that the position under the Bill of a discharger who applies for consent before the appointed day is that he is protected against prosecution in respect of the charge, while his application is being disposed of, unless it exceeds the amounts or limits specified in the application. If, however, he does not apply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
till on or after the appointed date it will be unlawful to continue his discharge after that date without consent, and he runs the risk of prosecution.<br><br>
The underlying policy is, of course, to encourage dischargers to apply for consent very soon after the Bill is passed. This intends to make it clear to the applicant that this would be the position, that his application would be allowed and disposed of quickly. It is with this idea of trying to encourage early application, that the whole thing has been arranged, and damage could be done if we were to accept the Amendment moved by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). I hope that in probing this, both hon. Gentlemen are satisfied that the provisions of the Bill in this regard are admirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For my part, I am grateful for the explanation which the Under-Secretary of State has given and I now see the point of the words about which I was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<p>In line 22, leave out "that" and insert "the last foregoing".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that will be convenient and I am grateful to you, Mr. Steele, for bracketing this series of Amendments together.<br><br>
When I first read subsection (3), I was impressed by the idea that a person who had put in a purification plant and who had then ceased to use it should be dealt with by the river purification authority, but on reading it again it struck me that the provision was unnecessarily narrow, because it would appear that the powers given to the authority would apply only to applications before the appointed day. In other words, only applicants under the Bill and not necessarily those given consent under the 1951 Act would be affected.<br><br>
I have suggested this series of Amendments to find out why the Government have so cribbed and confined the Bill in this way and to see whether it would not be an improvement to widen the subsection so as to make it applicable to those whose discharges were controlled under Section 28 of the principal Act. If a person has put down a purification plant and for some reason best known to himself ceases to use it, he should be dealt with by the purification authority, whether his consent was given under the Bill or under the Act. There is undoubtedly a great temptation to various dischargers, including local authorities, to bypass purification plants from time to time. My proposal seems to be sensible and I believe that it would improve the Bill enormously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had been successful with some of his earlier Amendments, or had not been so kind as to withdraw them after discussion, these Amendments would be relevant. I understand his attempt to improve the Bill, provided that one starts with the assumption that earlier Amendments had been incorporated into the Bill. However, having said that, I find it a little difficult to appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, although I shall comment on the Amendments as I understand them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
The Amendments change "the applicant" to "any person making a discharge" and so on, but there is no Amendment which would change the reference to "the applicant" in the last line of the subsection. That is only a minor criticism.<br><br>
Secondly, if the Amendment were accepted, the subsection would refer to the discharge of trade or sewage effluent
<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not controlled under section 28 of the principal Act".</p></blockquote>
The order which the sheriff is empowered to make by the subsection as amended is to make the effluent controlled under Section 28 of the principal Act. Clearly, if the effluent is already controlled under that Section, there is no point in the sheriff's office making such an order.<br><br>
The purpose of subsection (3) as drafted is to withdraw from an applicant for a river purification authority's consent to the making of the discharge the exemption from prosecution which is given by subsection (2). This exemption lasts only till the application is disposed of and protects the applicant from prosecution for offences under any of the enactments listed in subsection (2)—generally, for putting poisonous substances into a stream. The reason for withdrawing the exemption is that the applicant is failing to make proper use of, or failing to repair and maintain, purification plant so that the effluent passing through the plant is likely to become worse. This is thus a preventive measure to ensure that applicants with purification plant discharge effluents at least in no worse a condition from the pollution point of view than they were when the application was made.<br><br>
I have tried to explain this provision. It is not an easy matter to explain. The hon. Gentleman has done a great deal of homework and I must compliment him on it. I have tried to understand his intentions. I cannot see any way of accepting any of the Amendments, which are founded on a premise which no longer exists. If the hon. Gentleman has any further questions, I will try to answer them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation, although I do not know that I altogether agree with him, because the effect of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
the subsection is to give power to the sheriff to make an order not to apply Section 28 of the 1951 Act, but under the immediately preceding subsection, which is quite a different matter.<br><br>
A good deal of thought should be given to this matter. I am the first to admit that my Amendments may not be perfect, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider whether he cannot bring those people who are controlled under the 1951 Act under the same sort of discipline if they give up purification plants in this way. I apologise for having omitted the necessary Amendment to the reference to "applicant." On the understanding that the hon. Gentleman will at least think again about the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one thing which puzzles me and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to enlighten me. In subsection (3) there is the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"notwithstanding that any discharge made by him has complied with the requirements of the last foregoing subsection …".</p></blockquote>
I read that to mean notwithstanding that any discharge has complied with subsection (2). Subsection (2) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If an application to the river purification authority for their consent under this Act is duly made before the date appointed … then, until the application is disposed of, it shall not be an offence under, or a contravention of"—</p></blockquote>
there is then listed a number of Sections of Acts—
<br><blockquote><p>"to make a discharge from the land or premises …".</p></blockquote>
I am not quite clear what is meant by complying with the requirements of the last foregoing subsection. If it means that the applicant is not exceeding the limits specified in the application as respects temperature, volume and rate of discharge, then I am puzzled as to why exemption should be withdrawn from him, which is the effect of the wording of subsection (3).<br><br>
This is a complex matter, which is why I am explaining it as slowly as I can. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will tell me if I am not making it clear. It may be that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"notwithstanding that any discharge made by him has complied with the requirements of … subsection"</p></blockquote>
(2) means that he is not offending against the Acts mentioned. If he is not exceeding the limits which he himself has put in his application and his plant goes out of use, or he is not repairing it, it seems a bit hard that he should none the less have the exemption removed. I am not sure whether that is the interpretation.<br><br>
I am sorry to have raised this matter at short notice, but I could not see any way in which to put down Amendments dealing with it, because it involves so much that is in the Clause. If I have not given the hon. Gentleman enough time for an explanation, I shall perfectly understand it, because I have been in his position many times and I know that it is sometimes difficult to answer a technical question at very short notice. I shall quite understand if he wants to let me know later in writing what the answer is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for speaking as he did and for giving me a moment for reflection. The idea of subsection (3) and particularly of the phrase the hon. Gentleman has mentioned is to make sure that while an application is pending the discharge does not get any worse. That is the point. It is purely a temporary arrangement. In a sense, it is a reserve power, because it would have to be on the dissatisfaction of the authority before the matter was reported and proceedings begun. It would have to be an exceptional case and if there were pending an application which would later be granted confirming that, it would clearly be outrageous if the offender were so offending that the authority concerned felt obliged to look for reserve powers to operate the penal Clauses against him, first by invoking this part of the exemption.<br><br>
I hope that this is not a power which will be used, because that would mean a breakdown in the relationship between the authority concerned and the person who at that moment, by definition, was making the application for consent. It seems to be an extraordinary situation, but it would be wrong not to have this reserve power and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we need
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
such a reserve power for the authority in the delicate period of negotiations with the applicant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. I am not suggesting any alteration. The provision means that notwithstanding that any discharge made by the applicant has so far complied with the requirements, that he has been within the limits up to date, the danger is that he might exceed those limits in future. I am perfectly ready to accept the hon. Gentleman's explanation.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
(FURNISHING OF INFORMATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 40, to leave out from "to" to the end of the line and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"perform the duties conferred upon them by the principal Act and this".</p></blockquote>
The Clause gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations by way of a statutory order to assist purification authorities to obtain information which they require. It qualifies that initial statement by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"to deal with applications for their consent under this Act …"</p></blockquote>
That provision seems unnecessarily restrictive. We should give the Secretary of State power to include in the regulations the power to ask for information to enable the authorities to deal with the various duties conferred upon them by the Bill and the principal Act. That would help the authorities and Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. I have no doubt that when he was working by candlelight the candle went out at this point and he did not read the following subsection. If there were no reference to the following subsection, we should have to enlarge the whole Clause. The reference in subsection (1) is to subsection (2), which in turn refers to Section 18(4) of the 1951 Act. Therefore, the Secretary of State considers that he has ample elbow room to make regulations such as those which the hon. Gentleman quite rightly suggests are necessary. Accordingly, I believe there is no need for the Amendment.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
In fact, it might complicate matters. Indeed, it might be a little dangerous to bring it in at this stage because the reference to the subsequent subsection is already in the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill is left as it is, it will be complicated for the layman to understand. Subsection (2) refers him to the principal Act and to other things. It should be easier for ordinary people like myself to understand the powers vested in the Secretary of State. There may be a valid reason why the Bill is drafted in this way, but when the Government come to deal with other Bills, they should consider ways of simplifying them rather than making them more complicated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to comment on the law. I am not a lawyer; I am a doctor. However, my understanding of the law is that sometimes simple laws are the most complicated to implement properly. If a person has the principal Act before him and looks at Section 18(4) of it, he will find it reasonably easy to deduce what entitlement the Secretary of State has to make regulations.<br><br>
I do not see how we could improve on subsections (1) and (2). No attempt has been made in Committee to improve on them. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) says that we do not have enough powers, and he is trying to extend them by reference to the principal Act. We are doing this, too, in subsection (2). I do not see how we can elaborate on that at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) must have been working by candlelight and that apparently the candle went out at this moment. It seems that the hon. Gentleman had to find another candle in order to get through the rest of the Bill because he has put many other Amendments down. I presume that he, being a solicitor, was able to understand the full implications of the Clause, but that notwithstanding his training in and knowledge of these matters he found great difficulty in marrying subsection (1) with subsection (2).<br><br>
I appeal to my hon. Friend not to get bogged down by the practices of the past. We should try to simplify Bills so that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
ordinary people—and it is ordinary people who sit on river purification boards—can understand the implications of them without having to refer to other Acts. This practice is getting out of hand. It would be wiser if my right hon. and hon. Friends put the full meaning and implications of their intent into the Bill. I do not wish to pursue the matter on this aspect of this Bill, but I counsel my right hon. and hon. Friends to be a little more explicit in future Bills and to make them much more easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State referred to subsection (2), but, as I understand it, that is not under discussion now. We pass to discussion of subsection (2) later. Having said that, let me return to the Amendment. I admit that my candle must have gone out while I was considering subsection (1), because I did not notice the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the provisions of the next following subsection".</p></blockquote>
However, I still think that the Amendment, together with another Amendment to take out those words, would improve the Bill enormously and strengthen the Secretary of State's hand. I do not pursue the matter because my Amendment is not complete, but I ask the Under-Secretary of State to give further thought to this matter between now and Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I came to subsection (2), I lit a new candle. In fact, I had to light two and even three candles to assist me in trying to make out what this subsection meant. I read it, and read it, and read it. I got more muddled the more I read it. It seemed to me a masterpiece of obscurity. Not only have we legislation by reference to a previous Act, to which one must refer if one is to understand this—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is expressing a view about the whole of subsection (2). Is it his wish that we should take the Amendment in page 5, line 1—leave out subsection (2) and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) The proviso to subsection (4) of section 18 of the principal Act shall not apply to any directions given under that subsection so far
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
as they require particulars prescribed by such regulations—</p></blockquote>
with the one in page 4, line 46?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Steele. I am addressing myself to the Amendment in page 5, line 1. I had forgotten the Amendment in page 4, line 46. I take back what I said.<br><br>
I beg to move, in page 4, line 46, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Before making any statutory instrument under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult with such local authorities and other persons or associations of persons as appear to him to be substantially concerned; and any such statutory instrument shall not have effect unless approved by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1) confers fairly considerable powers on the Secretary of State to make regulations. Although I admit that the Secretary of State—even the present Secretary of State—might act reasonably, it is possible that any Secretary of State, whether the present one or one drawn from the party to which I belong, might benefit from representations made to him. If he is to make these regulations, there should be provision in the Bill for making them in the ordinary way.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State makes regulations by Statutory Instrument it is customary for the order to be placed before both Houses of Parliament so that Members, who, after all, are the representatives of the various interests involved—industrial, agricultural, and so on—can make representations about the regulations. I am asking the Secretary of State—I hope that he is not taking dictatorial powers because of the change of Government—to adopt the usual custom, namely, to place the regulations before both Houses and to allow Members to make known their views on the proposed regulations.<br><br>
Far be it from me to discourse at great length, as the Minister of State has so often done in the past, about the difference between the positive procedure and the negative procedure. The hon. Gentleman has frequently made the plea that regulations should be made the subject of a positive resolution of both Houses. That gives Members of Parliament a much more convenient opportunity of making their views known instead of the regulations coming up for discussion in the middle of the night—possibly a Thursday night, when there are no Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
Members in the House—[HON. MEMBERS: "One."]—or comparatively few. It would be convenient to hon. Members when dealing with a matter of this sort if the positive procedure were adopted and the Statutory Instrument required approval by means of a positive resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State, in making these regulations, would not rely on his own views. He would not be taking dictatorial powers. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) said, the Secretary of State has had not only great experience of industry and agriculture, but a distinguished military record and is an outstanding authority on education, apart from having a well rounded experience in other fields, including, no doubt, the countryside, and the pollution of rivers, of which he has been a strong opponent for many years. One has only to look at Ayrshire to realise that.<br><br>
However, despite that experience and the experience of the Minister of State and his colleagues, the Scottish Office would not rely on the personal experience of Ministers in bringing in these regulations. These regulations would stem from the river authorities and river purification boards, which are made up of members of local authorities as well as representatives of the other interests concerned. Obviously there would be the maximum consultation with the local authorities and with all those actively concerned with the work of the river purification boards, as well as close consultation with those in industry and agriculture. Then there is the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee, which would be able to make a final assessment of the draft regulations. Only then would the Scottish Office be brought into the picture and the Secretary of State consulted before issuing the regulations.<br><br>
In our view, it is unnecessary to make this Amendment to the Clause. Certainly in relation to the affirmative procedure this would be carrying matters too far in view of the great burden which Parliament has to carry. I concede the value of the affirmative procedure in Parliament. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has successfully, and unsuccessfully, argued many times in Committee that there are occasions when it is right and other occasions when it is not applicable.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
It would be wearying Parliament to impose on it an obligation to review all these regulations, which are highly technical and whose genesis, in some cases, may be in local authorities, industry and agriculture. Therefore, the Government cannot accede to the request of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) that we should incorporate the Amendment in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make only one small point in order to get the record straight. Inadvertently, I think, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said that before the Secretary of State brought in regulations there would be the fullest consultation. He said that local authority representatives would be on the river purification boards and that the local authorities would be consulted. I am sure that my hon. Friend understands the position, but I want him to make it clear to the Committee that this would not be so. There would be consultation with the local authority representatives on the river purification board, but not with the local authorities as such. They do not report back. They are there in their own right and make their own decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The constitutional point which my hon. Friend raises is valid, but, toy virtue of their local authority experience, the local authority representatives on the board would be able to evaluate any proposed draft regulations. In the normal way, the Secretary of State would also, consult the local authority associations. This is the only proper way to frame regulations in Scotland when they abut on so much local authority interest and concern. I admit that the point made is sound but, as I say, there is a provision that we should consult the local authority associations, too.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am horrified by the answer. Time after time in Scottish Standing Committee and Scottish Grand Committee we have had the argument put at great length by no less a person than the Minister himself that the Secretary of State was taking unto himself dictatorial powers. Here we have a proposal for great powers for this secret Secretary of State, whom we never see in the Committee. Where is he? I do not know. We never see him in Committee. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
never hear him answering Scottish Questions. I do not think that we have had a single speech from him on Scottish affairs. He is probably sitting in the Scottish Office exercising dictatorial powers. He takes unto himself the power to make regulations. He says that he will consult local authorities, the river purification board and everybody else, except the elected representatives of the people, the Scottish Members of Parliament. I am deeply and utterly shocked.<br><br>
I will not argue the difference between the affirmative and the negative Resolution procedure. I care not which of these is adopted, but it is vital, to the constitution that regulations of this sort should come before Parliament. We have been told that the regulations may be technical. That may well be so. The Secretary of State may well consult the river purification boards. I have no doubt that he consulted the boards before introducing the Bill. Even so, many Amendments have been put down—and they are not frivolous Amendments. There might well be just as many Amendments to the regulations and they, too, would not be frivolous.</span></p>

At the risk of being repetitious I must remind the Committee of what I said. It took me three candles to read the Clause and to try to understand what it meant. It is an example of the very worst type of legislation by reference. Not only does it legislate by reference in such a way that to understand it one must turn back to Section 18 of the 1951 Act but one must also read all through the second part of the subsection, which</span></p>

<p>It is an impertinence on the part of this absentee Secretary of State to propose to take unto himself this power and to deny Parliament the right to amend the regulations. In those circumstances, no matter how much I am prepared to assist the Under-Secretary of State, I cannot withdraw -the Amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the new definition, and speaking with great medical experience, I accept that my hon. Friend has not moved a frivolous Amendment and that in the past the Committee has often had long, tedious and occasionally repetitious argument of this sort. But without any doubt, better cases will occur in future legislation for this point to be made. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment on this occasion, because we want to get on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider this matter to be of the very highest constitutional importance and I cannot withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That those words be there inserted:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 14.</p>
<p>quite gratuitously explains what the reference is all about. It refers to Section 18(4) of the principal Act. It does not give any indication of what that means, but there is a proviso and gratuitously it explains what the proviso means. All this could be said in about half the length. I have tried to help the Minister by redrafting the subsection in an intellible form. I admit that it still contains a reference to Section 18(4), but one has to turn to that Section anyway. The reference might as well be in the simplest possible terms and, with the greatest respect, I suggest to him that my drafting is better than his.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the Amendment would be to remove the first leg
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
of subsection (2) of the Clause, which provides that any particulars prescribed by regulation under subsection (1) may be included in directions given by a river purification authority. I am sure that it is not the hon. Member's intention to do this. His intention is to make the whole thing clearer, but in his effort to be helpful he would rob us of that leg, which is essential for the operation of the Clause.<br><br>
Section 18(4) authorises a river purification authority to give directions requiring any persons discharging effluent into any stream in their area to give such information as to the discharge at such times and in such form as may be specified in the directions. The proviso provides that directions are appealable to the Secretary of State. The Clause would authorise the river authority to include in directions particulars prescribed by regulation under Clause 3, and it follows that there ought not to be an appeal against such particulars as required by regulations made by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I know that in this and in the next Amendment the hon. Member is trying to rescramble this, but, with great respect to him, this is not the way to do it. Probably in the Labour Government of 1970 we shall be able to bring in consolidation legislation affecting not only the Bill and the Act but perhaps even the Hill Watson Report and a sewage code—and even land drainage. I cannot anticipate the programme of the Labour Government of 1970, but this type of point, which is not an invalid point, could be looked at more closely then. But in this context it would be wrong to accept the hon. Member's Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to weary the Committee by repeating what I said about the need for simplification, but I emphasise the need to put even subsections or Sections of other Acts into a Bill such as this when we are talking about the original Act. As far as I understand the position, at present there is no scarcity of paper. There is no reason in the wide world why the Section in the previous Act should not be contained in the Bill to make it more intelligible for those who seek to understand what is meant. There is no reason why time and energy should be wasted

by the legal profession or by laymen such as ourselves turning to previous Acts of Parliament to obtain a full interpretation of what is required.<br><br>
If we accept the contents of the subsection, will my hon. Friend tell me his interpretation of it, because I find great difficulty in reaching a proper interpretation of the complicated terms contained?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an example of the difficulty in which the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Baxter) finds himself. The difficulty which I have found as a trained lawyer was almost as great. The Under-Secretary of State said that there might be a Labour Government in 1970. I hope not. I would remind him that he is in power at present. Will he look into this matter between now and Report? I do not agree with the hon. Member's interpretation, for I think that the provisions for these directions are already sufficiently wide, but I accept that my drafting may not be perfect. Between now and Report, will he give some thought to clarifying this subsection even if it is only to the extent of leaving out from (4) the second time it occurs to "shall"? That would be an improvement. It is not beyond his wit between now and Report to improve this completely unintelligible subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think about everything that the Committee says but I do not want to make any definite promise here. I shall honour every promise which I make. I do not want to make a definite promise in this case because I might consider that I cannot go any further than I have already gone.</span></p>

This is a probing Amendment. In the 1951 Act power is given to river pollution authorities to make byelaws and it seems to me that that was essentially a very good decision. I do not know whether any river pollution authority has exercised the power to make byelaws. I see the Under-Secretary of State shaking his head. It is worth while retaining<br><br>
