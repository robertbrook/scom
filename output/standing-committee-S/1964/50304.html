	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [2nd March],</i> In page 6, line 5, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"have his name removed from the register"</p></blockquote>
and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"disciplinary action under subsection (1) of the next following section".—	<i>[Mr. Hendry.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying when we adjourned on Tuesday, the Wheatley Committee, in making its Report, described the disciplinary rules which were applicable to the solicitors' branch of the legal profession but made no comment, adverse or favourable, about them. I was going on to point out that in paragraph 142 of the Report Lord Wheatley explained that under the present procedure there was no practice of punishing a teacher for any professional misconduct, but that any disciplinary action taken by the Secretary of State was taken solely with the object of protecting the children. That is what the Under-Secretary said in her reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Lady that if a teacher is deprived of his livelihood by being struck off the register it is a very great punishment, whether or not punishment of the teacher is intended. Whether or not the striking off is permanent or temporary it is a very serious penalty. I have suggested that we ought to make provision for a lesser penalty to mark the displeasure of the professional body at the professional misconduct of a teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been asked what is in-famous conduct in a professional respect. It is incapable of definition. It reminds me of the old conundrum, what is the difference between an elephant and a lamp post? It is impossible to define it, although everybody knows. In the medical profession there has grown up a code of practice by which is well
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
understood what infamous conduct is, and I am certain that the same sort of code of practice would grow up in the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) raised the question of the competence of any professional body to impose fines. He suggested that this should be a matter for the courts. You know from your outside experience, Mr. Brewis, that it is not unusual for statutory bodies other than courts to impose fines. The Potato Marketing Board regularly imposes fines, subject to an appeal to the courts. In this case it is open to any teacher who feels himself aggrieved by the action of his professional body to appeal to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with all the points that have been raised. I have paid special attention to the views expressed by the hon. Lady. I agree that there may be imperfections in the second Amendment as drafted, but I suggest that there is a good deal of substance in the Amendment which I have moved, which provides for disciplinary action other than striking off the register. I suggest that, after reconsideration of the matter, the hon. Lady might accept this Amendment, at least in principle, and give a good deal of thought to the second Amendment, which she may wish to alter to suit herself. If she does not go the whole length of accepting the principle of the Amendment she might accept it to the extent of providing for a formal censure as well as an informal warning, which is not mentioned in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having appealed to the hon. Lady to-give further consideration to this point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if, with the next Amendment, No. 76, we take at the same time the following Amendments: Amendment No. 80, in Clause 11, page 7, line 16, leave out "a criminal offence" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an offence which in Scotland is an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months".</p></blockquote>
and Amendment No. 81, in line 16, leave out from "offence" to end of line 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that would be convenient, Mr. Brewis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move, in page 6, line 9, to leave out from "of" to the end of line 10 and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an offence (whether in Scotland or elsewhere) which in Scotland is an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months".</p></blockquote>
This Clause provides that the Investigating Committee shall be charged with the duty of conducting the preliminary investigation into any case where it is alleged, among other things,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a person who has been duly recommended for registration, and has applied to be registered, has been convicted of a serious offence …"</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the phrase "a serious offence" is very ambiguous, and capable of a very wide interpretation. In many cases it might give rise to frivolous complaints against teachers. Opinions as to what constitutes a serious offence vary widely according to individual ideas of the relative seriousness of different actions, and I have attempted—possibly not very successfully—to define what a serious offence might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person is convicted of a crime which involves moral turpitude it is obviously a serious matter, but there can be more doubtful cases of offences which do not involve any moral turpitude. To take a ridiculous extreme, there is the case of the teacher who allows his chimney to go on fire. Nobody would suggest that that is a serious offence. It therefore seems necessary to draw a line somewhere. If a person were convicted of drunkenness, without being involved in the driving of a car, some people would take a much more serious view of it than would others. There are occasions, however, when the best of people forget themselves, and the circumstances of the case might not be serious at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the non-legal Members of the Committee, will the hon. Member explain what is an indictable offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point. It is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have attempted to produce some sort of definition of a serious offence. When my right hon. and learned Friends and I were considering the matter we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
had under review another Bill which is at present before Parliament, in which the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"An indictable offence shall be an offence punishable by summary conviction or imprisonment for six months"</p></blockquote>
were used. That Bill was written in English terms, and although the meaning was quite clear we have come to the conclusion that those words are not particularly applicable to Scotland, because in the law of Scotland there is nothing which is technically known as an indictable offence. In Scotland offences may be tried either by what is called solemn procedure or summary procedure. An offence which is being tried by solemn procedure is one which is capable of being tried by a jury, either in the High Court or in a sheriff court. That very serious and solemn procedure is not used for minor offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely there are cases in Scotland which can be tried by a jury but which involve nothing more than a question of compensation. By the hon. Member's definition it would be thought that such cases were serious ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Member's point. I was trying to explain that there are two types of case in Scotland. There are civil cases and criminal cases. Civil cases concern persons who seek compensation for a wrong, or try to recover a debt, or something of that sort. They are private disputes or disagreements between citizens, and there is nothing criminal about them. Such cases may be tried by a judge sitting alone, or by a judge and jury. We must forget about such cases when considering the Bill, because the Bill is concerned with criminal jurisdiction, and with persons who are accused of some sort of crime or offence against the State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has referred to a Bill which was discussed in the House on Tuesday night. On that occasion he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Someone must have told the Secretary of State for Scotland that there is no such thing in the law of Scotland as an indictable offence."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd March, 1965; Vol. 707, c. 1204.]</p></blockquote>
As I understand the hon. Member he is now admitting that there are such things as indictable offences. Either his statement on Tuesday is true or what he has just said is true. Am I not right in saying that all Common Law offences and many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
statutory offences are, at least theoretically, indictable in Scotland? My hon. Friend has legal advice at her disposal to assist her, and I shall be grateful if she will confirm what I have said. If I am right, what is the point of asking for penalties of up to six months' imprisonment to be inflicted on people who commit slight offences of the sort that the hon. Member has mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member were patient he would allow me to come to that point. I was about to explain it when an intervention was made by his hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), who asked for an explanation of the different types of case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I asked for an explanation of an indictable offence. I am still waiting for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is about to get it. As I have explained, there are civil cases and criminal cases. The Bill does not deal with civil cases. It deals with the criminal jurisdiction of the courts. It has nothing to do with compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two methods of dealing with these cases. There is the solemn procedure, with a jury, and the summary procedure, in which a judge, who may be a judge of the High Court or an ordinary burgh magistrate, usually sits by himself. If the case is being dealt with by a jury the proceedings are started by a document known as an indictment. This document is not used in summary cases. There are, therefore, two distinctions between these procedures before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) says, all Common Law offences can be tried on indictment. On the other hand, many offences which are not Common Law offences but are created by Statute can be tried by indictment, although others cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admitted at the outset that my Amendment is, to some extent, defective in that I have not defined what an indictable offence is. Nevertheless, I trust that the Under-Secretary will explain the position. I will probably be prepared later to withdraw the Amendment, but I would prefer not to do so at this stage, even though I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
admit that it is defective, because the Committee requires an explanation on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain offences are, in their nature, of a criminal type; that is, they involve moral turpitude. On the other hand, statutory offences which are not tryable on indictment are, in my view, the type which do not involve any moral turpitude, and if they are of such a minor nature that they are not eligible for punishment of at least six months' imprisonment they should not be regarded as offences for this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in moving the Amendment, has shown how defective it is. He is becoming more uncertain the longer he speaks about the purpose of his Amendment and what it would achieve. Would it, as drafted, include all Common Law offences and all statutory offences, other than those which could be the subject of a summary prosecution? Is that the effect of his Amendment? I can hardly think that it is, but, if it is, I suggest that he seeks the permission of the Committee to withdraw the Amendment forthwith so that we may get on with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not asking for permission to withdraw it at this stage. I have been trying to explain its effects, which would be to treat as offences for this purpose all Common Law offences because, as has been pointed out, every Common Law offence is capable of being tried on indictment. Thus, in that respect an indictable offence would include every Common Law offence known to the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Committee will think that my definition in the Amendment is too wide. If so I will be prepared to consider the matter further and, perhaps, withdraw it altogether later, but first we should have the views of the Under-Secretary about this matter. In this connection, the other effect of the Amendment would be to include, for the purposes of the Clause, all statutory offences for which a Statute provides sentences exceeding six months. Thus, if a Statute created an offence for which the maximum penalty was, say, three months, that would not be an offence for the purposes of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
My whole purpose is to get a better definition of the offences covered by the Bill. "Serious offence" is an extremely wide expression and it would depend on the discretion of the person who is trying to apply the Clause, whereas the Amendment at least defines the expression to include a Common Law offence and a statutory offence for which a sentence of over six months is permissible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman states that he wishes to simplify the Clause, but I suggest that all he is doing is making it more complicated. Does it not boil down to the fact that it is a Common Law offence to steal an apple while it is a statutory offence to be in charge of a vehicle while intoxicated and then to kill somebody? Your suggestion—[HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Member's"]—I apologise. I should refer to the hon. Gentleman and not "you". His suggestion is that it is a very serious offence to steal an apple but a moderate one to drive a vehicle and kill somebody. If he is suggesting that this is simplifying the Clause, I suggest that he thinks about the matter again. Indeed, his Amendment is absolute nonsense because it is much more sensible to refer to a "serious offence" because everybody knows that it is not a serious offence to steal an apple whereas everybody equally knows that it is a serious offence to drive a vehicle while intoxicated. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the Amendment before we go any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all a matter of opinion. We are deliberating in this Committee for the precise reason that we wish to improve the Bill. If we can find a better definition of "serious offence" we should do so. As it is, what is a serious offence is something for the individual to decide. Indeed, it is a matter of opinion as to how serious an offence stealing an apple is. In the eyes of the law stealing an apple or anything else involves criminal intent. It is a moral wrong. On the other hand, driving a motor car at 40 m.p.h. in a built up area when the speed limit there is 30 m.p.h. involves no criminal intent at all. In the other case, where a person is drunk in charge of a vehicle and kills a person, that is a very serious matter indeed, and would be chargeable as an indictable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
offence because, in that case, the person could be charged with culpable homicide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit, once again, that my suggested definition in the Amendment may not be perfect. It is an honest attempt to achieve something better than we have in the Bill now, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will give due consideration to the matter, as a result of which I hope that a better definition than that which exists may be found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have ever heard an Amendment moved more ingenuously. The hon. Gentleman stated that he did not like the Clause as drafted, so he had tried to think of a way to improve it. Having tried to do that, he has suggested something which would make it worse. But he is still not happy with the Bill as drafted. I am certain that he would not wish me to spend unduly long discussing what he himself admits is a rather defective and faulty Amendment. However, I will explain the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is thought that the Bill should not be more precise than it is in attempting to define a "serious offence" or "serious misconduct" because, first, it follows the Wheatley Report which, in paragraph 147, put forward the argument for a generalised formula similar to that in the Medical Act, 1956, rather than to be very precise. For offences which are serious offences or serious misconduct the Investigating Committee will have the duty to decide what is relevant to teaching, and this is the purpose of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment would, had it been framed in a more satisfactory way, have been to bring a greater degree of precision into the criteria on which the Investigating Committee should inquire into any matter. It would, first, exclude the possibility of a reference to the Disciplinary Committee of a case of serious misconduct which did not amount to or which was dissociated from a criminal offence. There might be examples of this, but it would be undesirable that a loophole should be permitted, because there might be the possibility of misbehaviour in relation to pupils. It is essential, secondly, that the Investigating Committee should not be precluded from having regard to any matter which is brought before it. It is impor-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
tant to remember that there is a distinction between the gravity of the offence from the criminal point of view and from what might be called the professional point of view, and there might be different considerations involved in particular cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman himself explained the difficulty of using precise words in his Amendment. He also explained, when questioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Mary-hill (Mr. Hannan) that in Scotland all Common Law offences and many statutory offences are, at least theoretically, indictable. Thus, the Amendment would not be satisfactory as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to remember that the Investigating Committee merely has to decide whether there is a 	<i>prima facie</i> case to go before the Disciplinary Committee. It has no other function, and the wording used in the Clause is a sufficient guide to the committee in exercising its discretion as to whether or not it should refer a case to the Disciplinary Committee. The decision to refuse registration lies with the Disciplinary Committee, subject to appeal. This seems to be a fair enough protection against any frivolous complaints being referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, therefore, not be of real help to the Investigating Committee or the Disciplinary Committee to seek to adopt a more precise definition, whether in the form of the Amendment or in any other form. Indeed, for the reasons I have explained, to seek to be more precise—to attempt in any other form to specify offences—would be to hamper the Committees in their functions which are laid on them in the Bill. It would also make it more difficult for the Investigating Committee and the Disciplinary Committee to reach their decisions on the basis of what is relevant to teaching. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 83, in page 6, line 32, to leave out from "committees" to "that" in line 34 and to insert:

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be convenient for the Committee to discuss, at the same time the next Amendment, standing in the name of the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest, Mr. Brewis, that it would not be convenient for the Committee to take that Amendment with the one being moved by my hon. Friend. It is not quite on the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case we will deal now only with Amendment No. 83.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We revert again to what has been the general theme of most of my Amendments—that the teaching profession should be in the control of its own professional affairs. We are proposing to set up two Committees, one for the purpose of investigating professional complaints against teachers and the other to take disciplinary action against teachers. These are purely professional matters and the Under-Secretary has already made it perfectly clear that in certain circumstances it will be for the employing authority to deal with the teacher if it is a matter of, say, conditions of service. However, these are purely professional matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with infamous conduct or serious offences committed by teachers and all this has professional connotations. Even though action taken against a teacher may be for the benefit of the pupils, in a case of that sort the members of the teaching profession should themselves be able to deal with their weaker brethren who have got into professional trouble. As drafted, it would be possible for members of bodies outside the profession—members of local authorities or, as I have suggested, a retired policeman who might be brought in for the purpose of making investigations on behalf of the local council—to be represented on these Committees. That is completely undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are setting up a responsible body to regulate the professional matters affecting the profession. The only body of persons really interested in these professional matters are the members of the profession themselves. These Committees, which will have such drastic powers to make investigations into faults on the

part of teachers, are to apply discipline to teachers in a professional respect, and we should leave this entirely in the hands of members of the profession themselves, and no outsiders ought to be members of either of these Committees. That is the gist of the Amendment. I hope that my suggestions will commend themselves to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is again suggesting that we should get down to the details of what the Council will do. He wants to tell the Council in advance that everyone on committees appointed by the Council must be teachers. Yet the Council itself is composed predominantly of teachers. Therefore, if the Council wants to have all teachers on it for professional reasons, there is nothing to stop the Council from doing so. The hon. Gentleman suggests that, if the Council, composed mainly of teachers, wants to have some non-teachers on its Investigating Committee, it should be prohibited from doing so. This is the essence of the Amendment. It is farcical. Why should we tie the hands of the Council in this way? If it is supposed to be in the teachers' interests, the Council, which is composed almost entirely of teachers—I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) disagrees with me on this, but if he studies the constitution he will find that what I am saying is absolutely true—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really must insist on this, that there are 10 practising teachers. There is a majority of people who have been certificated as teachers, as indeed I have been, but it would be wrong to say that I am a teacher. For my sins, I am a Member of Parliament. There are only 10 practising teachers on the Council. We are under a big misapprehension as to the nature of the Council if we treat it as having a majority of teachers. They are people who have been trained as teachers, but many of them are now working in other capacities, such as directors of education concerned with administration, and principals of training colleges concerned with training; but they are not teachers. We misunderstand the nature of the Council if we continue to delude ourselves in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that, I ask the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West if this is what he means by his Amendment. Does he mean that directors of education and all these other ex-teachers are to be forbidden to serve on these Committees? Must it be only serving teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intention is perfectly implicit from the words of the Amendment, that those who serve on these Committees must be registered teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Registered teachers? I take it that a director of education is a registered teacher. Can somebody help me on this? I am not a lawyer. I have the utmost difficulty in following the legal mind. In fact, legal men do not seem to be able to follow one another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is perfectly clear. A director of education may or may not be a registered teacher. There is nothing in the Bill or any other to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West may or may not be valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it was truthful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying in the meantime that it was not valid. I have heard the old saying in Scottish local authorities, "A baillie is a baillie for the rest of his life". I would think that a teacher is a teacher for the rest of his or her life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To get down to the actual details of how this will work in practice, the only time non-teachers will be on the Committees is when a majority of teachers want them to be. The implication of the Amendment is that, when a majority of teachers want non-teachers to be on the Committees, we in advance tell them that they cannot have them. If this is so, it is not worth any consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is pursuing here a line of thought he has had all the way through the Bill. It is perfectly understandable, but I must disagree with it. He would like the Bill to follow in a number of respects the course which is followed in the case of

solicitors. The Solicitors Discipline (Scotland) Committee is composed entirely of solicitors, with no lay members on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing one must say to the hon. Gentleman is that there must be a very sharp distinction between solicitors and teachers or members of the Teaching Council. One particular aspect, which is relevant here, of the difference between them is that any offences which a solicitor might commit would be probably of a somewhat complex nature involving intricate matters of law and legal procedure and lay members would simply not be able to understand either the nature of the offence or what should be done about it. It would be entirely a question for lawyers to have their own battle about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, in relation to teachers, we are concerned with something which everybody agrees involves the public interest, as, indeed, the Wheatley Report stresses in paragraph 47, when it discusses the difference between the concept of the Teaching Council and the concept of the councils controlling other professions. Teaching is essentially a personal matter, and the problems which may arise in disciplinary cases may well involve the public interest. It is, therefore, appropriate that there should not be the total exclusion of any members of the Teaching Council who may not themselves be registered teachers but who nevertheless have a profound interest in the public aspect of education. The Clause as it stands, unamended, would clearly meet the desires of teachers to ensure that nobody outside their profession is able to control them in these matters, because it prescribes that there shall be a majority of registered teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendment would be to exclude the public interest from any consideration of disciplinary or investigating matters of this kind. On that ground, I think that the Amendment must be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that I am trying to exclude the public interest, because we are dealing with an entirely professional matter.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
Secretary, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 34, to leave out from "person" to "who" in line 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will observe that subsection (4,	<i>a</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the membership of each of the said committees"</p></blockquote>
shall be such that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be a majority of registered teachers".</p></blockquote>
We have discussed that. It then says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"no person (other than the chairman of the Council) who has acted as a member of the Investigating Committee with respect to any case shall act as a member of the Disciplinary Committee with respect to that case".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Amendment is to exclude the words "other than the chairman of the Council". In other words, we want to ensure that, even though he is Chairman, the Chairman does not have a right to sit upon both the Investigating Committee and the Disciplinary Committee. It is true that the Chairman is considered to be in an independent position. On the other hand, in nearly all cases it is assumed that the Chairman has a casting vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know the exact procedure which will be followed, because paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Council shall make rules as to the procedure to be followed".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we do not know whether the Chairman will have a casting vote. However, as it is nearly always necessary that he should have one, one must presume that it will be so. If any precedent is to be observed, it is clearly in Part II of Schedule I, paragraph 9(2), concerning the Chairman of the Council:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The chairman, or in his absence the person acting as chairman, of the Council shall have a casting vote in the proceedings of the Council."</p></blockquote>
We feel that the principle which has already been embodied in subsection (4,	<i>a</i>) is wise, that members shall not serve on both the Investigating and the Disciplinary Committees. The purpose of the Amendment is to extend this provision also to the Chairman of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand very well what has prompted the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
Tweedsmuir) to move the Amendment and to say what she has said. It is an unnecessary Amendment from this point of view: the Investigating Committee will not go into a case beyond the point at which it decides that there is a case to answer. There is no question that it will then go on to establish whether the case is proved; only whether there is a case to answer. There is clear advantage in having some continuity in the proceedings so that the Chairman of the Council may be a member of each Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strongest argument I can put to the noble Lady is this. When this whole point was looked at before in relation to other professional bodies establishing their own investigating and disciplinary procedure—for example, in the Medical Act, 1956, and again in the Opticians Act, 1958—similar provisions were incorporated. The president of the council, under the Medical Act, is permitted to serve on both the Penal Cases Committee, which corresponds to the Investigating Committee under the Bill, and on the Disciplinary Committee. The same is true under the Opticians Act. This provides continuity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not threaten in any way the person who is coming before the Investigating Committee, because the Investigating Committee takes matters only up to the point at which it decides that there is a case to answer. All further proceedings, examination of the case in greater detail, and examination of possible disciplinary measures which should be taken if the case is proved, are for the Disciplinary Committee. Therefore, I do not think that we need worry about providing the same continuity as is accepted by other professional bodies as being necessary. Therefore, we can regard the Clause as it stands as being perfectly satisfactory for our needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Among other professional bodies, one or two of which the Under-Secretary has mentioned to the Committee, is there a provision such as is laid down in subsection (4), which clearly states that members of the Investigating Committee shall not serve on the Disciplinary Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. The whole point is that the continuity under both those Acts applies only to the president
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
of the council. In other words, it is exactly the same procedure as we have here in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say very much, except that it may be helpful to the Committee to know that in the Law Society Council in Scotland difficulty has been experienced on this very point. It has been found very desirable to separate the Disciplinary Committee completely from the Council, even to the extent of having a separate clerk. I support my noble Friend in her contention that there should be complete and utter separation of the two Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I omitted to restate another question which I put when moving the Amendment. When the Disciplinary Committee makes its own rules, as it is entitled to do under Schedule 3, will the chairman have a casting vote? Although I recognise the hon. Lady's point about continuity, it means that the Chairman is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the noble Lady to answer her own point during the course of her speech by referring to the power of the Council to make its own rules. This means that I cannot possibly answer the question. I can merely make the same sort of assumptions as the noble Lady has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are deciding in which two separate directions we go. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) and the noble Lady on this Amendment are anxious to move the Bill in the direction in which solicitors run their affairs, where there is complete separation. We have examined the precedents in professional bodies other than that of solicitors because of the public interest which is involved, because of the different type of investigation that is required; that is, not investigation into the complex legal matters which are those of solicitors, but into those involving a public interest, as with doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can give the noble Lady a more specific answer to the point she put to me. I gave her the general assurance, but perhaps I can now say what is contained in the Medical Act. The Act secures that a person other than the president of the council who has acted in relation to any matter concerning discipline as a member of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
Committee constituted shall not act in relation to the matter as a member of the Disciplinary Committee—in other words, exactly the same as here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have to decide, as we did in framing the Bill, that on these matters, as Wheatley suggested, we should follow the precedents of the medical profession rather than those of the legal profession. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West and the noble Lady on this occasion would have it otherwise, but we beg to differ. We think our way more successfully embodies the element of public interest which is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Under-Secretary has made out her case. It is entirely a question of opinion or judgment. In view of the examples the hon. Lady has quoted, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 43, at the end to add:
	<br><blockquote><p>(6) The making of an allegation to the said committees or the giving of any information in connection therewith shall confer qualified privilege.</p></blockquote>
We think that where a person is asked to give information, either to the Investigating Committee or to the Disciplinary Committee, he or she might be very hesitant about doing so if there were any fear of an action for slander or libel following upon it. The purpose of the Amendment is to make it clear to all concerned that they are completely protected in giving information, whether voluntarily or after being called on to do so, unless they do it as a result of malice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, in the law of Scotland, a difference between absolute privilege and qualified privilege. Absolute privilege is a privilege which we have as Members of Parliament speaking in Parliament, where no action can be taken against us. In certain other respects there is a qualified privilege, qualified to the extent that privilege is not granted where the wrong statement is made as a result of malice. It would be helpful to people who are in the unpleasant position of having to give a statement or evidence to the Committees if they were clear that they were not liable to proceedings
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
for slander or libel unless they were acting maliciously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the hon. Gentleman as briefly. This matter requires a great deal of legal background. I have consulted the legal experts at my disposal very fully and I am assured of the position. The Amendment is unnecessary. The making of an allegation or the giving of information to either Committee would be protected by the doctrine of qualified privilege without need of this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Qualified privilege exists where a statement is made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his affairs in matters where his interest is concerned. The indication or statement he makes must be to some person legitimately interested in the matter, as will be the case if he makes it to either of these Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an explicit provision, in the sense of the Amendment, in the Solicitor's (Scotland) Act, and again the hon. Gentleman is following that Act as a model; but again, the precedents in the profession to which we have been looking do not include this provision because of the doctrine of qualified privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has again had to refer to the fact that most of these Amendments are based' on the Solicitors Act. Does this mean that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) is trying to turn this Council into a town council and run it in the same way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has been trying to do is to hold up the solicitors as a shining example of how professions should run their affairs. One can see how far this is the line of thought he has followed. There are numerous precedents for not including the provision contained in the Amendment. These are to be found in other professions concerned, like dentistry and medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that assurance I hope that the hon. Member will agree that the Clause as it stands is satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the hon. Lady to have another look at this because I am not certain that what she says is correct in every case. Qualified

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
privilege is a very dicey subject and it is not at all certain how the courts will interpret it at any one time. It would be advisable to write this into the Bill so that people concerned would be covered beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Slightly sneering remarks were made about my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) trying to make this Bill like the Solicitors Act. I see nothing wrong in that. It is a particularly good Act which has worked well. What my hon. Friend is trying to do would give the teachers a great deal more power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this point, however, I should like a great deal more assurance from the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked at this very carefully and have taken legal advice. I can refer the hon. Gentleman to the judgments that have been made in the Scottish courts on unqualified privilege. Lord Craigie Aitchison's judgment gave a complete understanding to me as to why the Amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Qualified privilege, according to that judgment, would protect anyone making a legitimate complaint based on their own public concern and interest in matters relating to their own affairs to bodies of this kind, and there would be no need for a special protection to be written in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the legislation governing the medical professions, no specific provision of this kind exists and no case of difficulty has arisen, to my knowledge as far as the General Medical Council is concerned. If any hon. Member can say that there have been cases where difficulties like this have arisen and where it has been necessary to go to the courts, it might be necessary to look at this again, but all the precedents I can find indicate that, such is the acceptance of the nature of qualified privilege, and such have been the court judgments, that there can be no question of any need to write in this provision. I do not say this merely on the basis of discussion here. I have looked into the question in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do not doubt the hon. Lady's good faith at all, or that she has looked into this with great skill and ardour, but I am still not satisfied. Why did the solicitors put it in?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
They are lawyers and know what they are about. They thought it necessary, and surely it would be necessary in this case. Were all these cases she mentioned in the Scottish courts and were there appeals to the House of Lords, and did the House of Lords take a different view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about appeals to the House of Lords. These were judgments in the Scottish courts. The matter does not seem to have proved the kind of issue in which appeal to the House of Lords became necessary. There seems to have been no doubt in the minds of the judges about the position. This has not been one of those elaborate and tenuous processes in which doubt has arisen. The Lord Craigie Aitchison judgment was quite clear:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The basis of every action of slander is that the slander complained of is untrue in fact. The privilege arises, not from the truth of the words complained of or the knowledge of their truth, but from the relationship in which the party making the allegation stands to the party to whom the allegation is made, and from the whole circumstances in which the allegation comes to be made. If the communication relates to a matter which the person making it would be justified in communicating, if it were true, to the person to whom the communication is made, in virtue either of an interest or of a duty, legal or moral, the occasion is deemed to be privileged, and the privilege is not displaced by an averment that the communication was in fact untrue and known to be untrue. If the untruth of the allegation should be established at the trial, and if it should turn out that the accusation was made in the knowledge that it was untrue, or recklessly without any consideration as to whether the defamatory words were true or not, it will be for the jury to say whether the proper inference to draw is not an inference of malice."</p></blockquote>
It is clear that where there is legal or moral duty there is qualified privilege. That is the protection of the law at present and why the Amendment is unnecessary and would be rejecting the precedents of other Acts dealing with similar circumstances. It would introduce a precedent in the absence of any kind of suggestion that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), having made unnecessary and offensive remarks about me, has not had the courtesy to remain for my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has suggested that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and I have slavishly followed the Solicitors

(Scotland) Act. That is not so. We considered this Bill quite independently of anything in the Act, because the law of qualified privilege is a very doubtful business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the hon. Lady to give us the law at second hand. My hon. and learned Friend is one of Her Majesty's counsel learned in the law. Although I do not come into that category I have had a great deal of experience of practice of the law. I am extremely disappointed that the Law Officers are not here to answer for themselves, and it would be highly improper and discourteous of me to cross-examine the hon. Lady in a subject in which she is imperfectly qualified. I say that with respect to her. This is a difficult question of the law.

There comes the question of what is a legal or moral duty. There may be grave doubt in the mind of a person as to whether he has a legal or moral duty. I can envisage many cases where a person would be hesitant about giving evidence because of the danger he would be running. Even if this Amendment is really unnecessary there would be no harm in including these words to avoid doubt. Hundreds of Acts include words which are probably unnecessary but which nevertheless are there in order to avoid doubt. This provision is extremely desirable, and for the purpose of the record I must tell the Committee that I cannot withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 11.—(DECISIONS OF DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 7, line 45, after "include", to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a conviction, particulars of the conviction and sentence, and in the case of infamous conduct in any professional respect, the facts proved and".</p></blockquote>
This is a practical Amendment which I hope will at least commend itself to the hon. Lady. She gave us some hope on Tuesday that she would be rather more forthcoming later but our patience has to continue. If the Disciplinary Committee has considered a case it is open to the person, if registration is refused,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
or if his name is ordered to be struck off, to appeal to the Court of Session. That is provided for in Clause 12. As a practical matter, if appeal is made to the Court it is necessary for the Court to have before it certain facts. For that reason my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) and I have sought to include certain further information than is provided for in Clause 11, which simply states that the Disciplinary Committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include a statement of the reasons for the direction".</p></blockquote>
We think it essential, if the Court is to deal with this logically and sensibly, that there should be set forth precisely, in accordance with the usual legal procedure, the facts which have been proved before the Disciplinary Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an order is made because of infamous conduct in a professional respect, or if it is made on account of a conviction, it is not sufficient, from the point of view of the Court considering the appeal, to set forth reasons, but that there should be set forth particulars of the conviction and sentence which constitute relevant information for the consideration of the Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being a little ungenerous. Last Thursday I gave way on something and said that I would be prepared to look at something else. On Tuesday I did the same. His patience is by no means strained. He has had a fortunate time in some of the considerations I have promised to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seeks to bring more precision in this point. It is clear that the person in whose case a direction has been made knows in specific terms the ground on which that direction has been made and can, therefore, consider his position effectively and decide what he wants to do in relation to any appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not point out, however, that under the rules to be made under paragraph 2(1,	<i>a</i>) of Schedule 3, the notice given by the Disciplinary Committee to anyone who comes before it
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include a statement of the alleged facts and circumstances on which the proceedings are to be based".</p></blockquote>
It is clear that the Bill intends that a full account of the position shall be given. The statement of reasons to be included

Lady said it would be more suitable to discuss it on Clause 11. We had a considerable debate on Clause 6(1) as to the particulars which should be prescribed on the register and which should be available to the public. One of the questions asked of her was whether, when a person has been removed from the register for infamous conduct and has been restored, the particulars of his past conviction or whatever it was attending the removal of his name from the register will be available either to the public or, as is said in Clause 6, shall also be part of an issue of a certified extract from the register. This is an important point which raises the question whether a person having recovered from whatever the offence was, and having been restored to the register, should have this, so to speak, held over his head always.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs, Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I did not give my reply earlier. I thought that I had dealt with it, but perhaps I omitted to do so amongst all the other points. The answer is that the extract from the register will not include any reference to the subject of disciplinary proceedings but will simply give the name, address and qualifications, etcetera, as we discussed them earlier, without any extra information about the person's background or what had happened to him. The extract will replace the parchment and contain particulars of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts of removal from the register and the reason for it will be known, of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
course, because this will be a public matter but there will be nothing in the register itself. The person's name will be added to the register, taken off and then, if he is restored, put back again. Nothing will be written in the register which indicates any reference to proceedings which might have taken place. There is no intention that the particulars to be prescribed under the rules for the keeping of the register will involve the information we are considering in Clause 11. They are purely the details which at the moment are necessary for certification and no doubt will be necessary for registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend consider a different form of words rather than this phrase "an extract from the register" which may replace the parchment? Could she give some indication of which other individuals could apply for an extract? Could a member of the public do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be out of order If I attempted to answer that question on this Clause. It was my impression that I had answered some of these points in earlier discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I think, Mr. Brewis, that you are about to rise to call me to order. I think you would have been quite justified in doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause provides for a 28-day period for appeal. My knowledge of the law is pretty rotten now, but surely 28 days is a very short period, and much less than is allowed under the normal processes of criminal law? Would it not be more just to extend the period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No appeal shall lie from a decision of the Court of Session on an appeal under this section."</p></blockquote>
Why not? Suppose a point of law arises: should there not be an appeal to the House of Lords?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 28-day period is very much a standard period in the other professional codes. In effect, the hon. Member is asking whether 28 days is ever right as the period to be laid down in any similar field. We have no reason to suppose that 28 days would not be long enough. No difficulty seems to have arisen about it. This might be one of the matters which would arise in another Standing Committee sitting at the moment. But, on precedent and present procedure, 28 days seems to be enough, and we have no reason to suppose that it should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member's second question concerned an appeal from the decision of the Court of Session. One can best apply the knowledge and accumulated wisdom which is gained as a result of the experience of other Acts of Parliament in similar fields. This provision follows very closely the provisions made in other Acts concerned with other professions. There seems to have been no particular difficulty and no anxiety that the provisions should be changed. The hon. Member is therefore asking me to create a new precedent in relation to all legislation dealing with professional bodies if he asks that a further appeal should be granted under this Clause. I hope that that answers his questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It answers the questions, but I thought that we had a dynamic Government who were prepared to strike out on their own. Here is a good chance for them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Referring to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) on the last Clause, may I put a question to the hon. Lady? If a document authorised under this Bill does not reach the person by registered or recorded delivery post within 28 days, what happens? Suppose he is abroad and does not get the document? Does he have time in which he can make representations, if he has not received it, that he should have further time to make an appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase in the Clause is "required to be served". Any notice or document has to be served. My understanding of that is that it is not enough to drop it through the door. One must satisfy oneself that it has been served. There is a difference between the provisions in the Clause and the reference in one of the Schedules to registered or recorded delivery post for other purposes. Here we are concerned with serving documents in the legal sense, and in this sense no difficulty should arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is stated clearly that it has to be served within 28 days. What happens if it cannot be served within that time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it has not reached the person on whom it is being served, it has not been served.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had grasped that, but the point is that it is clearly said that it has to be served within 28 days. If, for one reason or another, the person cannot be found, does he have another period of grace, so to speak, in which he can have it served upon him and lodge his appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point. The hon Lady is addressing herself back to Clause 12. I should have to take advice about this, and if the hon. Lady raises the question on Report, I will give her a clear answer. As we are concerned with appeal to the Court of Session, I should have thought that any failure to make an appeal within time which was not due to the fault of the individual but was due to some extraordinary difficulties could itself be the subject of an appeal to make an appeal out of time. This happens in other matters when the courts give permission to make an appeal out of time, and I think that it would apply here, but I do not want to give an answer off the cuff and I will take advice on the point. That is my impression, and I will confirm it between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here concerned with orders which are to be made by statutory instrument. We are not concerned so much with regulations as with orders. The Clause confers the power to make an order or to vary or to revoke it. It also provides that any such order made by statutory instrument shall be subject to annulment on the basis of the negative procedure. The single exception to that is the order referred to in subsection (2) made under Clause 18(3), which appoints the days for bringing in the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders which may be made under this Clause are, first of all, bringing the Act into operation; secondly, the order under paragraph 1(8) of Schedule 1 which would approve a scheme of the Council for the election of elected members other than members of colleges of education—that is, members representing the teaching profession generally; and, thirdly, an order by the Secretary of State under paragraph 6(1) pf that Schedule 1 which would amend the provisions of the Schedule in regard to the composition of the Council. These are the orders which would be involved.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel rather more strongly about the point I am going to make than I did about the earlier ones. I would ask the hon. Lady to look at it. I considered putting down Amendments to include all the interpretations mentioned in the 1962 Act, but it would have been a very long series of Amendments, which would have confused everybody, and I did not think it worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Sections in the 1962 Act deal with interpretation in Parts III and IV, and then there are some more at the end. The point I wish to submit is that it is very wrong for Parliament not to produce tidy Measures which are easily understood and getatable by those who have to handle them. I know that this is an opinion shared by the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) and many Members on both sides of the Committee. I therefore suggest that the interpretation Clause should include all interpretations, including the 1962 ones to which reference is made. If that were done, practising lawyers would not have to search their bookshelves and all over the place. We would be doing a good job, 	<i>per se,</i> and making a decent Bill for the teachers. Will the hon. Lady please look into the matter and consider including all interpretations which apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to consider the general point. I have been studying some of the interpretations in the 1962 Act. I should like to look at

them all now. I told the hon. Member earlier that I might be able to bring one of the Schedules into the Bill, but what he suggests would require the inclusion of a much greater amount of detail. I shall consider the point, because I tend to agree with him in general. It also seems to me that if we are about to undertake law reform we might as well do the best we can in Bills we are now bringing forward. I have not studied carefully what would be the precise effect of the suggestion; it might make some of the Clauses rather unmanageable. I will, however, study the position closely, and if it is at all possible to make it unnecessary for the 1962 Act to be continually referred to I shall do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What are the different provisions mentioned in the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has really had her answer on this question. In introducing the Bill my right hon. Friend outlined what he expected the timetable would be. He said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the timetable, as I see it, is that we shall get the Bill through by the summer, we shall be able to set up the Council by September, it should be in a position to start exercising its authority in January, 1966, and take over my responsibilities thereafter."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 2nd February, 1965, c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
He would then propose in about April, next year, to hand over those of his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
responsibilities which he was allowing to lapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the noble Lady's second point, the different provisions are laid down in different parts of the Bill. She will not expect me to go back through the whole Bill. There is the question of the election of the Council, the rules, and all sorts of things. To answer her point fully I would have to refer to every Clause, and she would not expect that. The different days to be appointed will follow a logical sequence as the Council moves into being and gradually takes over the functions of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the clearest answer that I can give. She will not expect me to name dates. Given the framework of the timetable which my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting thing about the Clause is that certain Members have expressed surprise that it was not already in the Bill. Throughout our discussion there has been the assumption that this meaning was inherent in the Bill. It is, in fact, the sense of the Bill. A register is to be created of which all teachers who are entitled to teach will be members, and this will be the teaching body. That is the spirit of the Bill. Otherwise it is difficult to see the formal difference between this and the existing position with respect to certification.

It was not recommended by the Wheatley Committee. In paragraph 128 of its Report it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not, however, proposing that the need for registration should extend beyond the present scope of certification. We cannot recommend in present circumstances that it should be an offence for an unregistered person to be employed in teaching; but we do recommend that it should be made an offence for an unregistered person to pretend … to be a registered teacher."</p></blockquote>
The Committee did not recommend it, but it was not in its remit to suggest what would happen to people who were not registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the attitude expressed by hon. Members about the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry). I think that he has been making genuine attempts to impose safeguards so as to gain the confidence of the teachers. His Amendments have sought to strengthen the position of the teachers relative to the Council—and one of the functions of the register is to gain the confidence of the teachers whilst also safeguarding the standards of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause tries to introduce teeth—fairly dull ones, and not very sharp—which provide that in four years' time all people must be registered, or shall not be allowed to teach. Admittedly the Bill will come into operation only in or about April, 1966, but if the Clause is accepted it will be known from now on that four years will be given to those who have sufficient qualifications to become registered teachers to do so, and for others to begin to acquire the necessary qualifications for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some hon. Members on both sides feel some anxieties about the position, and that there is a feeling among certain members of the community that we are somehow against uncertificated teachers as people. I would point out that they are being given four years in which to become registered. If they have certain of the necessary qualifications they have four years in which to obtain the remaining qualifications and become registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
, It is not a question of creating a closed shop, because a closed shop refers to a trade union organisation. This is a question of safeguarding the qualifications of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
those who are teaching. If the Clause is accepted and, through it, we are able to obtain the co-operation of the colleges, it should be easy during the period of four years to establish the right kind of course for those who are at present uncertificated, so that they can become certificated and eligible for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause does not refer to those who are already qualified; it refers to those who are not qualified or who have not entered a course of study to acquire the necessary qualifications. That means that in some cases seven years will be allowed. It cannot be said that the Clause has sharp teeth. It expresses the whole spirit and feeling of the Bill. Without this there will be a tendency for us not to achieve what we are trying to achieve, namely to enchance the status of the profession in order to improve recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Clause the Council will be able to lay down qualifications for entry to the profession, and will then be able to consider individual cases. That will not happen under the Bill at present. The Council will be able to look at case A, where the teacher has strange or unusual qualifications, and say, "Yes, we can accept him". In case B, it can say, "No, we cannot accept him unless he takes a three-months', six-months', or one-year's course." It can begin discussing the problem properly and create the correct kind of entry qualification, based upon an assessment of individual cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend suggest that colleges of education do not enter into that type of consideration at present, concerning individual cases—and consider whether there should be a three-months', six-months' or one-year's course?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that they do not do so sufficiently, because the ' problem is not properly known. If people applied to the Council and it adopted this procedure, the problem would become known. The Council might receive many applications from the same kind of uncertificated teacher, who would not be formally accepted for entrance, and perhaps those 20 or 30 people, who were all shown to have the same kind of qualifications, could be told, "If a course were started within three months or six
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
months you might become fully qualified." At the moment that procedure is not carried out, and the problem remains unknown. That means that the kind of courses needed also remains unknown. Does my hon. Friend see the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the necessity to achieve registration would mean that people would have to apply for registration. Having applied for it, the Council would see the nature of the qualifications of such people and the Council would then know the number with similar qualifications; in other words, while a certain number would not at that moment be entitled to registration, courses could be arranged for them so that, in groups, they could achieve the necessary qualifications which would lead to registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be more convenient if the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
M. Galpern)—I now appear to have the HANSARD reporter breathing in the same direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the rôle and behaviour of local education authorities does not enter into our discussion at present. The point is that having established the necessity for registration, the Teaching Council will be able to deal with all those people who are at present largely neglected because they can exist just now as uncertificated teachers—but when they wish to improve their qualifications they may do so, although there is no liaison, certainly none of the right kind, between the uncertificated teachers and the organisations running courses for them. I suggest that the necessity for registration would force the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we would get greater co-operation, and the new Clause might help to solve some of the problems we are facing, for individual cases would be able to be discussed and it would be possible to accept person A who at present would be automatically uncertificated. I do not see why we need to be worried about the effects of the new Clause because if the qualifications are so low that the Council could not accept a person as a registered teacher—or if the qualifications were so low he could not be accepted under any conditions, even in four years' time—such a person would not be able to enter a course leading to registrator Such a person should not be a teacher in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to extend courses to draw in as many people as possible, particularly those already in teaching who are uncertificated. I want those people to get the full training leading to certification. That is why I suggest that we might force the position, knock aside some of the nonsense that is spoken about this issue and gain the confidence of teachers. Acceptance of the Clause would express the spirit, purpose and meaning of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a very large concession to ask the Under-Secretary to make—giving us four years in which to deal with the problem—and it would leave unregistered a very small number of people. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider the matter most carefully and, if possible, accept the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is because we all share this desire that we have been spending all these mornings discussing the status of the teaching profession and the establishment of the Teaching Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is how to achieve that aim. It is on this question that I differ fundamentally from my hon. Friend, who suggested that without the new Clause we should not be able to achieve the desirable objects he has in mind. I disagree. After all, one of the main purposes of Clause 3 is the duty laid on the Council to consider and make to the Secretary of State recommendations on the question of the supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause would appear to cut right across that instruction. There are practical aspects and implications involved in placing a time limit—a period after which no individual, no matter how good his qualifications; and there are many extremely good so-called uncertificated teachers in our service—on a provision of this sort, saying that after, say, 1969 unless a teacher has made good he will not be entitled to be employed by a local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As chairman of an education committee I can assure hon. Members that on many occasions at meetings with members of local associations of educational organisations in Scotland, we have raised questions similar to those discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West. Those meetings have always ended in complete deadlock when we have put point blank to them the practical problems which we face as an education authority in discharging our duties under the Education Acts, to ensure that every child has the right to education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have asked how we would take proceedings to ensure—even with the present shortage of teachers in Scotland—that the present position would be maintained, let alone improved, by the dismissal of people who are labelled as uncertificated teachers, I have yet to get a practical and reasonable answer. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
have been told, "You take the action, discharge them, and we will face the responsibilities". That is not a reasonable, sensible or practical way of facing a situation. Indeed, in Glasgow we have more than 300 uncertificated teachers. We could not take the chance of dismissing them immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what all this means. Nobody is suggesting that any authority should dismiss its teachers immediately. The suggestion is that those uncertificated teachers should have four years in which to become registered. The 300 teachers mentioned by my hon. Friend would remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the point is that we are asked so often to dismiss them forthwith. My hon. Friend suggests that that should not happen until 1969, but I seem to recall that Lanarkshire Education Authority passed a resolution along these lines; to dismiss them either next year or the year after. I may be wrong. But these problems must be faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This all ties up with the question of who is going to guarantee that, as a result of the efforts of the Teaching Council to meet the requirements of Clause 3 of the Bill, there will be an adequate number of teachers available by 1969. We are setting up this Council and conferring on it the duty to ensure that there is an adequate supply of teachers. If my hon. Friend can guarantee such an adequate supply will be achieved, I will withdraw my objection to the new Clause. But he cannot guarantee that. Nobody can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thing revolves around the question of what will be the supply of teachers by 1969. Who knows? It may be worse than at present. Would it be wise, in these circumstances, to insert a date like 1969 in the way my hon. Friend has done? Would it be wise, when local education authorities may be faced with a continuing shortage of teachers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend must accept that by his new Clause we would be giving uncertificated teachers four years in which to qualify. He should remember that there may be many reasons why people will be unable to avail themselves of the training available to them. People with first-class honours may, for one reason
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>289</span>
or another—I do not know why—not be willing to do this training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are faced with a deteriorating supply of teachers by 1969 we would be in an extremely difficult position if the new Clause became law. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that it would be unreasonable and unwarrantable to dismiss teachers who are not registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also disagree with my hon. Friend about the qualifications possessed by those who will be on the Teaching Council. Of its membership, 25 will be registered teachers, employed as teachers. Schedule I will ensure this. The Schedule states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"() The elected members shall comprise:—
	<ol>
	<li>5 registered teachers employed in colleges of education, including 4 (but not more than 4) principals;</li>
	<li>2 registered teachers employed in further education centres, including 1 (but not more than 1) principal;</li>
	<li>9 registered teachers employed in secondary schools, including 5 (but not more than 5) head teachers;</li>
	<li>9 registered teachers employed in primary schools, including 5 (but not more than 5) head teachers."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
They must all be employed. How can 25 out of 44 not be a good majority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Council will have a majority of registered teachers who are employed in the teaching profession and who are charged with the duty of looking after the supply of teachers. Is it unreasonable to expect that as a result of the establishment of the Council there will be a sudden rush into the teaching profession, so that it would be practicable for the Council to decide by 1969 that the supply of teachers is so adequate that we no longer need to employ uncertificated teachers? Would it be fair to tell the Council, "After this time uncertificated teachers must be dismissed"? No one can guarantee what will be the position regarding the supply of teachers by 1969, 1968 or any other time, but it might be adequate before 1969. The whole question of the dismissal of uncertificated teachers revolves around this problem. If by 1969 there is still no appreciable increase in the number of teachers available we would not be justified in saying that anyone who has not taken the opportunity to become registered should automatically be dismissed. Unfortunately, that is what the new Clause in effect states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
I am therefore, prepared to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the members of the Teaching Council, the majority of whom will be engaged in teaching and will be charged with the duty of looking after the supply of teachers. They in their wisdom will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State in due course on how they feel about the uncertificated teachers presently employed by education authorities. If they decide that the time has arrived, by a given date, when such people should no longer be eligible to be employed in the teaching profession, that will be a different matter. However, it would be quite wrong, at this early stage of establishing the Council, to lay down a time limit in the sort of way one is laid down in the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with the very greatest interest to the speeches made by the hon. Members for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) and Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern). I hope that neither the hon. Lady the Under-Secretary nor the Committee as a whole will wish to accept the Clause. There are various reasons why I say this. The first is the reason adduced by the hon. Member for Renfrew, West. He is entitled to ask that the Committee should go further than the Wheatley Report, but on this question, the Wheatley Report was very realistic. It said this in paragraph 128:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not, however, proposing that the need for registration should extend beyond the present scope of certification. We cannot recommend in present circumstances that it should be an offence for an unregistered person to be employed in teaching".</p></blockquote>
The Bill does not anywhere say that a person who is not registered is still entitled to teach. I hope that the hon. Lady will confirm that that still will be so as recommended by Wheatley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why I hope that the Clause will not commend itself to hon. Members is that we have spent a good deal of time considering the provisions whereby the Council shall have the opportunity to make recommendations to the Secretary of State on what should be done on the supply of teachers. In the circumstances of approaching the raising of the leaving age in 1970, those within the profession may well in time, and perhaps quite soon, consider again the question, for example, whether non-graduate men should be qualified to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>291</span>
teach in Scottish schools. I personally believe that this question will come before the Council and that different attitudes will prevail from those which have prevailed hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West allows four years in which the uncertificated teacher may equip himself to be certified. I still think that this is unrealistic, because of figures which I quoted in a debate on the Floor of the House on 2nd July last. We then had a general debate on education in Scotland. I do not expect that the figures will be so very different now, but perhaps the Under-Secretary will bring us up to date. The figures I then quoted of uncertificated teachers referred to October, 1963. There were then 2,425 uncertificated teachers in full-time employment. Almost 2,000 of these had some qualification or experience which fitted them for the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the type of uncertificated teacher who the hon. Member for Renfrew, West would like to see take a course or generally equip himself for registration. I said then:
	<br><blockquote><p>"About 1,050 of the 2,000 were mainly engaged in teaching subjects like music, homecraft, and technical and commercial subjects, and they were skilled practitioners of the subject or craft which they were teaching.… Over 300, although untrained and not graduates, had achieved the standard of general education testified by the possession of one or more degree passes or the equivalent.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Over 200 were graduates who had not had professional training, but many of these were experienced teachers. Some were from England and Wales, where graduates may be recognised as qualified teachers without training. Finally, there were some 350 trained teachers, although they had not obtained or were ineligible for a Scottish certificate. These included some who had recently arrived in Scotland and who had applied for but had not received certification. Some were young teachers from the Commonwealth who intended to spend only a year or so in Scotland."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd July, 1965; Vol. 697, c. 1676.]</p></blockquote>
I am not dealing with the roughly 400 uncertificated teachers who did not have qualifications of some kind or another. The new Clause addresses itself to all uncertificated teachers. It is therefore important for the hon. Member for Renfrew, West to consider whether it would be realistic for so many to be asked to qualify within four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every category to which the hon. Lady referred would be favour-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
ably considered and would be very likely to achieve registration. Thus, the uncertificated position would be totally changed. Those possessing English qualifications would be considered by the Council. Since teachers would have a guarantee both of involvement on the Council and of an end period to registration of uncertificated people, there would be an almost 100 per cent. possibility of teachers' acceptance of these for registration. It would dramatically reduce the figure of 2,425 uncertificated teachers to about 400. The noble Lady pointed out that many of those who were uncertificated were specialists. I accepted those as amongst those who should be accepted straight away—for example, teachers of music—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must make his intervention short, because in Committee he can always speak again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just defeated his own argument for the new Clause. The whole purpose of the Council is to consider whether people possessing different kinds of qualifications should not be suitable and eligible for certification. Therefore, it is not necessary for the hon. Gentleman to lay down in the Clause that everybody should enter
	<br><blockquote><p>"a course of study to acquire the qualifications necessary for registration".</p></blockquote>
What is needed is for the Council to address itself to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston has very great practical experience of this matter in Glasgow, which has the greatest teaching shortage and the greatest difficulties anywhere in Scotland. He spoke from that experience, which always commends itself to hon. Members. The hon. Gentleman addressed himself, rightly, to what will happen in the intervening years before the leaving age is raised in 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on 2nd July last we worked out that, at the time of the raising of the leaving age in 1970–71, on the present rate of recruitment, which is still a record, there will be a shortage of about 4,000 teachers. It is, therefore, unrealistic to adopt the view that advantage should not be taken of many of those who have qualifications of one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
kind or another and who contribute a very great deal to Scotland's educational system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no guarantee that, despite the high rate of recruitment, we shall not still have a slightly worsening situation rather than a better one. I refuse to use the term "wastage" in referring to marriage, for that is an extraordinary expression, but the fact that so many women teachers get married after three or four years and that the average time they are away from teaching is at least nine years means that we are facing real difficulty. It is for the Teaching Council to consider this question and, above all, not for us to accept the new Clause but to accept the recommendation of the Wheatley Report as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this seems to be an appropriate moment, perhaps the hon. Lady will tell us the new methods or new ways in Which the Secretary of State is now thinking of recruiting teachers, because once again I remind her that on 2nd February the Secretary of State used up four columns of the OFFICIAL REPORT dealing with the supply of teachers. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have to consider very carefully whether we can find new sources of recruitment … there are proposals now under discussion … We have not reached the point of decision, but, remembering the time scale, we must realise that this is not something that can be just put off, with the idea that we can let the Teaching Council deal with it. We cannot afford to waste … a month if we are to be in a position realistically to deal with the situation in 1970."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 2nd February, 1965; c 13.]</p></blockquote>
That speech was delivered on 2nd February and it is now 4th March. The right hon. Gentleman's month is up, but we have not yet heard any evidence of new methods of recruitment. For the benefit of the Committee, discussing this most vital question of supply of teachers, perhaps the hon. Lady will give an indication of Government thinking on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) has cogently argued a point of view that many teachers hold. No doubt they would be delighted if the Clause were to be included in the Bill. But while I sympathise very much, as he knows with that point of view, almost to the point of identifying myself with many of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
the considerations which led some teachers to it, nevertheless, in terms of how one achieves our mutually agreed objectives, I must tell him that the Clause is not the best way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of how the situation would arise in which uncertificated or unregistered teachers would no longer be employed. It would be provided for under the 1962 Act, Which makes provision for regulations to be made by the Secretary of State in relation to the kind of requirements which education authorities must conform to in discharging their duties of providing education. It is under the 1962 Act, together with the 1956 Schools Code and the Further Education Regulations, 1959, that the Secretary of State is empowered to approve the appropriate qualifications of a teacher. So if it were necessary to decide, at any point from the coming into being of the new Teaching Council, that unregistered teachers should not be employed or certain conditions should be imposed on the employment of unregistered teachers, it would not be necessary to change legislation. It could be done under the 1962 Act whereby certain additional requirements could be imposed by my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not think that, by refraining from including the new Clause we thereby lay down for all time that there will be no change in this respect. It is perfectly possible to make this change at any point thought to be appropriate by the Council, acting responsibly in relation to its duty to consider teacher supply, along with the Secretary of State. This is not a once and for all thing that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accepting that we all want to avoid a situation in which some authorities are feeling that they have to use uncertificated teachers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is rather a strong word, but accepting that we all want to avoid a situation in which some authorities feel that they are forced to use untrained teachers, what is the best way to change the situation? What my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) has said is of the utmost relevance. It is a question of increasing the supply of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
There is always the danger as soon as we consider teacher supply of being platitudinous. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) accused me of using platitudes in a recent debate on this subject. But so frequently has supply been discussed, and so many have been the propositions put forward, that the question that is important now is not saying over and over again the platitudes of what one's aims are but taking effective action to achieve some of the mutually agreed aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The E.I.S. has presented its views to all of us on how it thinks recruitment should be improved. I tried to explain, when we discussed in the House the supply of teachers—I remember my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston raised the question of employment of uncertificated teachers—the extent to which the Government were proposing to take more effective action than had hitherto been taken on many of these mutually agreed methods of recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that a month had now gone by since my right hon. Friend's Second Reading speech. It would be quite inappropriate for me to refer to the discussions going on within the Scottish Council for the Training of Teachers, but I assure her that the discussions have been proceeding and that, as soon as it is appropriate for the general conclusion of that consideration to be conveyed to my right hon. Friend, it will be a question for discussion on possible proposals to be made. It would not be appropriate for me to say more about that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other possible sources of supply—married women, for instance—I hope to make an announcement next week in association with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science. Jointly we shall launch a new campaign which will have certain slightly different aspects in Scotland. I do not want to go into it now, but I shall shortly announce a new campaign for the Special Recruitment Scheme which will have new features and which, I think, will be much more effective in bringing into training many people who perhaps left school too early but have the capacity for higher education and would be glad to come in though an ever-open door if it were provided for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
Perhaps I can convey to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West that, in terms of effective action along the lines which we are agreed with the teachers' organisations, we are hoping to see an increase in supply. But, as on many other questions, there can be no guarantee of this. There is no statistical formula which says that if we do something it will produce so many teachers. We have to see what the result is. In the light of that, it would be unwise if we did not hesitate and give time to see what the new measures will produce before coming to any conclusion such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked if I could bring her own figures of last year up to date and I am glad to do so. The point she made is substantial and one hopes that teachers in general will seriously consider it and, indeed, the whole discussion on uncertificated teachers. I understand their attitude. They have been so afraid of dilution and so resentful of the use of uncertificated teachers that they have tended perhaps to apply a blanket definition, as it were, without distinguishing what kind of people were being discussed. But the people they really mean, and the people the public thinks they mean, are those with totally sub-standard qualifications and no training. These rose, in the year up to October, 1964, from 473 in 1963 to 575 in 1964. Of the others, 354 were trained outside Scotland, of whom 67 were graduates, 220 were graduates without training in teaching and over 1,000 were skilled specialists but untrained for teaching. Then there were 346 who had made some progress in degree courses. It is difficult to define these categories but they had some extent of higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hopes that it will be possible soon to make arrangements for those with a very high standard of education but who have not got precisely the kind of training which, in Scotland, qualifies them for certification, to be provided with the training which would satisfy education standards and make it possible no longer to leave them outside the Bill as uncertificated teachers, as if they are the same kind of people who left school at 17 and have gone straight into the schools to teach. It is nonsense to allow such a situation. We have to think of absolute
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
terms of recruitment of teachers and when we do that we can move forward in the task before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In rejecting the new Clause, I ask my hon. Friend to consider this matter in terms that our opposition to it is not in principal but in terms of what is the next wisest step to take and of whether this new Clause would give an opportunity to do a number of things which would allow us to train and assess more clearly the degree of wisdom of attempting to bring in a suggestion such as this. It is a question of the stages by which one moves and of which is the best first step. That is all that is between us. I hope that, on that consideration, he will find it possible, if not to agree with me, at least to accept that perhaps we do not have to make this once for all decision at this point. I hope that the opportunity will be taken in the next year on the one hand to bring into registration many of the teachers who have high skills and a great deal of higher education but do not technically satisfy the Scottish requirements for certification, and, on the other hand, to stimulate recruitment where we feel effective action can do so. With the Teaching Council there can be real consideration, such as is now going on regarding the training of teachers, of any further steps which may in the view of teachers and the Government be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put to my hon. Friend a point about qualifications obtained by those outside Scotland? Here I think our country has been at its worst—illiberal, unreasonable and narrow minded. The hon. Lady knows of a number of examples. I know of one man whose training was in Poland, who is an admirable teacher and has been for many years, but whose qualifications are not recognised. Perhaps a more questionable case, although I believe that it has right on its side, is that of a man trained with a diploma in agriculture at a university in Belgium who found that he was unable to get the qualifications which, quite genuinely, he thought he had been promised when he came to this country. Anything which can be done to make us a little more rational about accepting other people's qualifications and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
and not being at our worst in this respect would be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, like many other hon. Members, in the early days of October I met a huge meeting of teachers before the General Election. I gave them an undertaking that I believed in setting a time limit along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West (Mr. Buchan) during which those who had not the qualifications should attempt to get the qualifications. I feel that I was right then; I go back on nothing that I said then; I believe that it is right now, and I believe that it will be right in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the question arises as to the best methods of achieving this. I suggest that it is not through my hon. Friend but through the Teaching Council—not by any action of our own but through the Teaching Council. It is no use setting up a Teaching Council and then taking its decisions for it. If we are to set up a Teaching Council, surely it must be a body of substance. If it wishes to establish a reputation as a heavyweight body, what better start could it have than to face up to the question of unqualified teachers? This is a great opportunity to set a pattern and a tradition by tackling this question head on—and there is no question about where my sympathies lie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find some difficulty in the matter. Largely, I agree with those who want to throw out the new Clause, because, looking back, I do not think that I was ever taught by anybody who was a certificated teacher.

I believe that it would be a good idea to look at these training courses and perhaps to cut them down a little. I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) in that many people with good qualifications have been excluded from teaching. I remember the example of an administrative officer for many years in Tanganyika in the Colonial Service. Although he was finally taken on, it was at a lower scale, and it was most unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A teacher must have a reasonable degree of knowledge, he or she must be able to exercise discipline, and he or she must be able to attract the attention of the child. I do not believe that many of these training courses can teach these things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself a little in the position of Satan in 	<i>Paradise Lost</i>—by the very arguments that were produced against him the more he was convinced of the rightness of his own point of view. In my isolated position, too, I feel like him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very many of the arguments which have been adduced here are in fact inherently involved in the passing of the Clause, because by that very fact we can analyse the nature of the problem of uncertificated teachers and can find out what I have for years pointed out to teachers—the problem which arises. I am in an extraordinary situation in being accused of expressing the teachers' point of view, bearing in mind my own disagreement over a very long time with my own teachers' organisation, as the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) will remember.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very large number of people who will be uncertificated teachers in fact have qualifications which might entitle them to registration or are very close to it. I believe that the Clause is in defence of many existing uncertificated teachers rather than against them—or, at any rate, the very large numbers of those who have particular qualifications, and especially qualifications outwith Scotland. An unreal situation is created by the employment of very badly under-qualified teachers, and it is alarming that the number of these has risen from 473 to 575, which is a very big increase of totally unqualified people who, because of their presence, have prevented a solu-

tion and have prevented the drawing in to full certification of those who have very high qualifications. This new Clause is necessary in defence of those highly qualified people. The moment the new Clause is introduced the Council has to look very carefully at existing qualifications and to make recommendations immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) deprecated talk of dismissing such teachers. I have never spoken of it. On the contrary, I see employment as being more properly and fully guaranteed. I am concerned only with those people who are totally incapable of gaining certificates and should not be employed. My conception of those people who can gain certification is very broad. I have spent my whole life in adult education and in training students who have failed the normal school level. We know far too little about human development. I want to broaden the intake into teaching, not to cut it down. This is what my hon. Friend did not realise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one argument of any substance which has been raised is that we cannot guarantee that we shall have sufficiently solved the problem of supply by that time. Where does this lead us? I accept that it is the one serious argument which I have to meet. If we accept it as valid, we have to accept that the only way in which we can solve the problem is by continuing to employ people who we have all agreed are totally unsuitable for teaching. Apparently we must have people who will simply stand as bodies in front of a class and are totally unable to gain any kind of certificate, despite the fact that we will have to provide many courses and spend a great deal of money on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is disagreeing with the hon. Member that the 500 to whom he referred, and who will never be able to obtain qualifications, should be looked at immediately by the Teaching Council. Surely in their wisdom they can examine the lack of qualifications of this category and decide here and now that they shall no longer teach in the schools. I do not object to that, but they are the body that must look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

in the Education Act, 1962, by which the Secretary of State is empowered to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me appropriate to add this new Clause. A local authority may employ or not employ a person as it likes, but I do not want it to employ people who should not be employed. The local authority has power to employ people who should not be employed, and unless the Secretary of State intervenes, this can happen. I want this safeguard written clearly into the Bill. It has been said that it is no use setting up the Council and then taking decisions for it. We are not doing that, because the Council has not the power to decide that someone it does not register shall not be employed. That is our power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By making this suggestion my hon. Friend is proposing to castrate the Teaching Council before it starts. It would be a pity to strangle it at birth by taking from it decisions of substance at the root of the argument of setting it up in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to follow my hon. Friend into that analogy. It is not a question of emasculating—perhaps that is the better word—the Council. The point is that the Council has not the power to deal with this problem. It deals with recommendations and teaching qualifications, but, unless we put it in the Bill, it has no power to say that certain people shall not be employed. It is without this power that the Council is emasculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all this, let me add that the existence of a Council of this nature, and the nature of this argument, will of itself lead to the necessary public understanding and involvement and will make it more difficult for local authorities to employ under-qualified people. As a result of that fact, plus the assurance that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be willing, the moment it is within his power to do so, to use this right to avoid the employment of uncertificated or unsuitably qualified people, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(e)</i> two registered teachers employed in independent schools including 1 (but not more than 1) head teacher.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 47, in page 12, line 5, at end insert:

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to secure separate representation on the Teaching Council for teachers in independent schools. By independent schools I mean not only the schools which are completely independent but schools which are semi-independent; they are ruled by their own governors but have a grant from Government funds. It is essential that we should distinguish the two types of a school in the consideration of these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland there are no fewer than 29 such schools—I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for giving me the information which I should have found difficult to acquire otherwise—of all sorts of description, ranging in size from 37 pupils to over 1,500. There are nearly 20,000 boys and girls educated in these schools. They are in no sense snob schools but are mostly schools which have been set up by endowments. They are widely spread throughout Scotland. There are four in Aberdeen, and they range to the Marr College at Troon. They are in the big cities, and they give education to a wide range of boys and girls drawn from all social classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost invariably they are fee-paying schools, but in addition to taking fee-paying pupils they offer a large number of places in varying proportions to the local education committees. In some cases these schools are the only secondary education available in the area of an education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These schools are of varying kinds. Some of them are Roman Catholic schools with a separate outlook. But they have one thing common to them all—they have individuality. Their own governors are able to lay down policy for the schools and to a large extent

they are able to experiment with education, not only among secondary pupils but among primary pupils, because practically all these schools take children from the age of 5. It is generally agreed by all concerned that schools of this kind have a value in the educational system of the country. The Committee of which Lord Fleming was Chairman in England and Wales stressed the importance of varied education of one

kind and another and said that it would be a pity if these independent schools were swallowed up into the general system because they had an important part to play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
