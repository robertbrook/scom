Clause 4.—(ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF LAND.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Further Amendment proposed [27th April],</i> In page 3, line 3, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State".—[<i>Mr. Noble.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Clause stands, the Board cannot acquire any land, be it by agreement or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary of State. Likewise, as the Clause stands, it cannot dispose of any land without the consent of the Secretary of State. I want to confine my observations for the moment to land acquired by purchase, fue, lease or excambion. As I said on Tuesday, one readily recognises the special position of land which has been the subject of a compulsory purchase order. This is all a question of emphasis.<br><br>
As the whole Bill stands the whole emphasis is placed on the powers of the Secretary of State. The emphasis which we would wish to exert would be on the independence of the Board. For the reasons adduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) on Tuesday, the maximum discretion should be given to the Board in relation to voluntary acquisitions and disposal of land. This does not mean that the Secretary of State is powerless. He has powers under Clause 2 (1) to give general directions. If, for example, he wanted to know in advance what the Board was doing or what it was in tending to do, there would be nothing to prevent him from giving a general direction to the effect that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I draw the hon. and learned Member's attention to the fact that he is discussing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
Amendment No. 89 at this point as well? I understand and appreciate his difficulty, and if he wishes to include Amendments No. 24 and and No. 89 in this discussion I would have no objection, but I would draw his attention to the fact that he is now beginning to discuss Amendment No. 89.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I was not referring to Amendment No. 89. I was referring to Clause 2(1). I was endeavouring to argue that, if the Amendment to delete
<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
with regard to the purchase and disposal of land were accepted, it would not mean that the Secretary of State had no powers. He would have the powers under Clause 2(1). I will go on later, when we reach Amendment No. 89, to adduce reasons for introducing that Amendment, because I accept that there must be a reserve power in the hands of the Secretary of State both with regard to the disposal of land acquired in this way and, in particular, with regard to the disposal of land acquired by compulsory purchase.<br><br>
Leaving Amendment No. 89 out of it altogether, the point I am trying to make at the moment is that, if these Amendments are accepted, it does not mean that the Secretary of State has no say at all in the disposal of land. The emphasis is merely being shifted to the freedom of the Board, with the occasional, where necessary, intervention by the Secretary of State, rather than, as the Bill stands, the constant, frequent, inevitable and statutory intervention by the Secretary of State at every turn.<br><br>
The Minister of State pointed out that it may be that the Secretary of State could deal with the acquisition or disposal of small areas of ground by general directions or general consents or approval under Clause 14(1). This is true. He could give general consent or general approval, subject to such conditions as he may think fit, under that Clause. Again, it is purely permissive. It is up to the Secretary of State to decide whether to do that. We on this side of the Committee want at every turn to try to strengthen the independence of the Board, subject to reserve powers on the part of the Secretary of State. Unless the Minister of State gives an undertaking that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0587">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
the powers under Clause 14(1) would be exercised in this way, it seems to me that the discretion is left entirely to the Secretary of State and that the Board is very much in his hands.<br><br>
For these reasons, I ask the Committee to approve both of these Amendments, although I accept that one ought to have regard also in that connection to later Amendments.<br><br>
With regard to the acquisition of land by compulsory purchase, the Board not only requires the approval of the Secretary of State. The position goes much further than that. The Board requires the authorisation of the Secretary of State under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947, paragraph 4(2) of the First Schedule to which contains detailed provisions which would have to be observed in any case of acquisition of land by compulsory purchase. So these Amendments do not in any way affect the powers of the Secretary of State with regard to the compulsory acquisition of land. I have conceded—I do so again—that with regard to the disposal of land so acquired the Secretary of State ought to have a hand in the matter. He already has power to exercise a control over that by general directions given under Clause 2(1). For these reasons, I recommend to the Committee that both these Amendments should be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The general procedure of the Board will be to frame proposals and present them to the Secretary of State. If the proposals entail the leasing, feuing, or obtaining of land by way of purchase or excambion, the Secretary of State, in approving the proposals, will approve of that. What the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie) is discussing, as I understand it, must be a very much smaller number of possibilities, because I should have thought that, as the Bill is framed at present, this in fact will be the general procedure and the Secretary of State will therefore approve. I should not have thought that that would cause much difficulty, because in the ordinary approving of such a scheme he would approve of the purchase or the feu, or whatever it might be.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
The Board might wish to acquire small portions of land for the purpose of erecting a tourist information bureau, for example. There is nothing to prevent the Secretary of State from dealing with such matters under Clause 14(1) by giving a general consent covering a specific category of acquisitions. He could do that in that way.<br><br>
What we are faced with, then, is what the Board might, if the Amendment were accepted, be able to do. As I understand it, if the Amendment were accepted, the Board could, by way of purchase, feu or lease, acquire quite large areas of land without the permission of the Secretary of State. There are, as we see it, certain difficulties about this. I appreciate the hon. and learned Gentleman's desire to give the Board as much freedom as possible. We rather question whether the Board should be allowed to do this without obtaining the Secretary of State's approval. It might be land that could better be used for other purposes. It might be land that should be used by the local authority, or land which the local authority wants to use for specific purposes it has in mind. It seems to us that we should say that the Board should obtain the approval of the Secretary of State when it does this.<br><br>
The arguments are very much stronger and rather different in connection with the disposal of land. The hon. and learned Gentleman has recognised the validity of most of the arguments which I adduced. We shall discuss this again later. We still feel that we must insist that these words be retained. From the consultations I had with various organisations when I was up north I learned that there was a certain concern about this; certain fears were expressed. We wished to make it clear in the Bill that we had no ulterior motive in giving the Board the powers to acquire land, or to purchase, feu or lease land, and that we were not embarking upon a vast programme of nationalisation in the Highlands by a subterfuge.<br><br>
It is therefore important, so that quite a number of interests which presented these views to us might be satisfied, that we should also include these words in the Bill. This is an additional argument. I do not think that it will create many difficulties, because in the vast number of cases the approval will be given by

<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 6, after "<i>(b),</i>", to insert "in default of agreement".<br><br>
The purpose of this Amendment is to give statutory recognition to what is accepted practice in the field of compulsory purchase. I understand that it is accepted practice that bodies with powers of compulsory purchase do not exercise those powers except in the last resort and in the absence of agreement. This Amendment would create no complications. If the general practice were not as I have described then the Amendment would be even more important because no statutory body should be given powers of this nature which it can exercise in arbitrary fashion without, in the first place, trying to reach agreement in the ordinary, commercial way. This is an Amendment which the Committee ought to accept. It would reassure many interests in the Highlands who, on reading this Clause as it stands, might reach the conclusion that the Board can resort to compulsory purchase without in any way attempting to reach agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what my hon. and learned Friend has said. I go further, because, as I understand it, if the Board wishes to acquire land compulsorily the Secretary of State can give his authority. If the owner of the land does not wish to sell, then the procedure is for an inquiry to be held, and eventually the result of that inquiry is put on the desk of the Secretary of State and he can say "Yes" or "No". Now, the Secretary of State is very much connected with the Board, and has all sorts of powers over it, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
to be left out stand part of the Clause:—</span></p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14, Noes 13.</p>
<p>works in co-operation with it. If this procedure is followed the Secretary of State will be the judge in his own case. I do not like this. I do not believe other hon. Members like it very much, and I suggest to the Minister, would he, in this instance, look at the possibility of altering the procedure and having an appeal to the sheriff, in cases of this sort?</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the face of it, the Amendment appears reasonable and attractive, but we expect that the Board will acquire practically all of its land by agreement. I would direct the attention of the hon. and learned Gentleman to the wording of subsection (1, <i>b</i>):
<br><blockquote><p>"acquire land compulsorily, if so authorised by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Secretary of State has to give authorisation for compulsory purchase; but if an owner were willing to sell the land then, clearly, the Secretary of State would not give permission for compulsory acquisition since there would be no need to do so. The Amendment, therefore, seems unnecessary.<br><br>
Also, it tends to be somewhat restrictive and delaying. If it were accepted, an owner, having no intention of selling, could carry on negotiations over a period of years, so that the question would arise: when does the owner fall within the wording of the Amendment? The Amendment uses the words "in default of agreement". At what point does failure to reach agreement arise? The hon. and learned Gentleman knows well that there are various means by which people owning land can delay the reaching of agreement. If this Amendment were accepted at what point would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0589">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
it become possible for the Board to say, "We cannot reach agreement and must go to the Secretary of State"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not that difficulty arise in any event? If it is the practice to try to reach agreement before resorting to compulsory purchase the Board has at some stage to decide that agreement cannot be reached and that there must be an approach to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We feel that the inclusion of these words in the Clause would weaken the position. Clearly, one enters into negotiations in order to try to reach agreement. Where, after some time, it is seen that it is impossible to reach agreement the matter is placed before the Secretary of State, who gives permission for the compulsory purchase of the land; which then involves all the procedures of compulsory acquisition. These are laid down under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947.<br><br>
I believe the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) will find that we have fairly safeguarded the position of an owner of land. Whilst agreeing with the hon. Gentleman that in any case the Board at some point would have to go to the Secretary of State where agreement was impossible, we believe that by putting these words into the Clause we should be creating an opportunity for a great deal of argument over the meaning of the term "in default of agreement" and when the provision would become applicable. We feel that that is not desirable, and for this reason we consider it would be unwise to incorporate these words into the Bill. We believe that by not doing so there would be no injustice to a landowner. I am afraid, therefore, that I must resist the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I am very far from satisfied with the Minister's reply. I know the procedures laid down in the 1947 Act. I say that in this case that procedure is wrong because the Secretary of State will be the judge in his own case. It is so much better to have an entirely new procedure and go to the sheriff, so that justice can be done and be seen to be done. The connection between the Secretary of State
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
and the Board is so close throughout this Bill that when the results of an inquiry are put on the Secretary of State's desk he will really be judging his own case, and that is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman feels that the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill is the correct Bill in which to change procedures laid down under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947. I should have thought not. I believe that if the time has come for a revision of the procedures which are generally applicable to the great bulk of compulsory purchase and which have been accepted by all Governments since that date, then that should be done by amending the 1947 Act, rather than in this Bill. The position of the Secretary of State has been raised before, but I should not have thought that this is the correct time or place to seek to amend the 1947 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a ludicrous argument. The fact that this procedure applies under other Acts is no reason for saying it should apply under this Bill. What is wrong in other Acts should not be incorporated in this. This is a new Bill. Why cannot the sheriff do it? What is the difficulty? It is extremely wrong to put forward a provision which is unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand my hon. Friend's difficulty. It is one which I expressed at an earlier stage. As the Secretary of State is so closely linked to the Board the procedure under the 1947 Act makes him virtually the judge of his own case, which is one of the reasons why we have tried all along to give the Board independent status so that when appeals arise the Secretary of State would in effect be deciding what would be best in the public interest as between two separate parties to neither of which he himself is linked. The danger to which my hon. Friend refers would be obviated if our Amendments, giving freedom to the Board and loosening the bonds linking it to the Secretary of State, were accepted. I agree that it would not be appropriate to seek to alter here the procedures of the 1947 Act, which has, on the whole, worked satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 11, to leave out "or otherwise deal with".<br><br>
Under this Clause the Board is enabled to acquire, hold and manage land. It is also enabled to dispose of land. Given that the Board has all these functions, we find it difficult to understand what could be meant by the words "or otherwise deal with". We would be grateful to the Minister if he could explain what else the Government have in mind here that the Board could do. If the Board is itself holding and managing land and no longer needs it, then, presumably, the words "dispose of" would cover what the Board would then wish to do. There is a possibility that it would hand the land over to some other Government body or Department. I do not want to anticipate following Amendments, but the Minister has himself referred, in passing, to procedures which exist in relation to the disposal of land. I would have thought that the words "disposed of" would cover any contemplated transfer from the Board to some other body, a Government Department or some official body like the Forestry Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing sinister behind these words. Their intention is no more than to make quite clear that the Board has power to make land available for use by other persons without actual disposal. It is a useful general phrase covering various ways of allowing land to be used. There might be the wish to grant permission for its use as a ski-run, or to grant a licence to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association to use a building as a hostel without purchase. We had that kind of thing in mind in putting these words into the Bill. There is a precedent in the New Towns Act, 1946, and the Town and Country Planning Act, 1945, if not in these precise terms. This was intended as a general provision to cover usage which might not be covered by the other words in the Clause, and there is no deeper principle involved.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everything the Minister has said seems to be already covered by subsection (3) of this Clause and by Clause 5(1,<i>c</i>). Under subsection (3) the Board has power to dispose of land—this is almost a definition of "dispose"—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
by way of sale, feu lease or excambion, which means exchange. I cannot see that the broad definition given to "disposal" leaves much room for the general words, "or otherwise deal with". I do not know in what context those words are used in the earlier legislation to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but I would be surprised if they were followed by what in effect is a broad definition of "dispose". I suppose that a ski tower would be a building and that is dealt with in Clause 5(1,<i>c</i>), by which the Board has power to
<br><blockquote><p>"hold, manage, maintain, hire, let or otherwise dispose of such works …"</p></blockquote>
I suppose that the same difficulty about the words "or otherwise dispose of" would arise in that connection, but there is no Amendment to that provision. Clause 5(1,<i>c</i>) is very wide as regards the disposal of appliances and buildings, and Clause 4 is very wide about what is meant by the disposal of land. I do not think that this is a matter which it is worth losing any sleep over, but I would have thought that the words "or otherwise deal with" were there only because the Parliamentary draftsmen found them in earlier legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have specified what can be done with the land by stating certain specific ways of disposing of it or using it. When one does that, one usually finds that members of the hon. and learned Gentleman's own profession are very apt to find something which is not covered by these specific words. So one has to include a general provision in case the legal profession finds something not covered by the specific words. We constantly have examples of this when we consider legislation. I think that the words "or otherwise deal with" in this paragraph <i>(c)</i> are reflected by the words in subsection (3), lines 18 to 20.<br><br>
I understand that this is a legal interpretation, but I prefer simply to say that this is a generality covering anything which might not be covered by the specific wording of the Clause. Such wording is not uncommon in Bills and we have all had experience of it. I have argued this sort of case at great length myself on occasion when I have been on the other side of the Committee and when hon. Members opposite, then sitting on this side, have made precisely the same
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0591">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
reply as I am now making and which I have always accepted in my usual—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—bland manner. I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will accept it in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is most refreshing to hear the Minister stating this view. As he says, we have memories, still quite fresh, of his deploying arguments, and every facet of the arguments, on questions like this. All I will say after his explanation is that we still do not feel that these words are really necessary, but we understand that for technical drafting reasons they may be thought to be necessary. We would not wish them to be used for the transfer of land without the proper procedures which we shall be shortly discussing.<br><br>
Concerning the examples which the hon. Gentleman gave, I would have thought that with a ski tow the Board would still be holding and managing the land and that that would have been covered by the wording of subsection (3). If a ski tower were arranged and a winter sports board happened to be running it the Board would still be responsible for the land and for holding and managing it. We are not entirely convinced by what the hon. Gentleman has said, but we will not press the matter, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 24, in page 3, line 21, to leave out from "it" to the end of line 25.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient with this to take Amendment No. 89, in line 25, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>(4) The power of the Secretary of State to give directions to the Board shall extend to directions as to the disposal of land notwithstanding that such direction may be of a specific character.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to note what further powers the Secretary of State is given in this provision. In addition to the general control which, under earlier provisions, he already has over the disposal of land, the Clause goes on to say that
<br><blockquote><p>"any power of disposal or otherwise dealing with the land shall be exercised in such manner and subject to such conditions as the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
Board may consider expedient and that Secretary of State may approve."</p></blockquote>
I would be interested to learn what is meant by that. If the Secretary of State already has power to give consent and to give general directions of a very wide nature I would have thought that these words were quite unnecessary. That is my criticism of that part of the Clause, with my earlier criticism that, in the ordinary way, the Board ought to be able to dispose of land which it has acquired without going to the Secretary of State at all.<br><br>
But recognising, particularly in the case of land acquired by compulsory purchase, that some residual power must be given to the Secretary of State in these cases, and that the general powers conferred under Clause 2(1), which relate to general directions, may not altogether suffice, it seems logical and proper that the Secretary of State should have power to give particular directions relating to a particular piece of land if he thinks fit. That is why we have suggested Amendment No. 89. These provisions are pre-cedented in other legislation. I would have thought that the Clause would be improved by the deletion of the last part of subsection (3) and the substitution for that of a new subsection (4) giving these reserve powers to the Secretary of State, but all the time leaving the emphasis on freedom of action by the Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to spend much time on the first Amendment, for I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. We have looked at this carefully and we do not think that these words add to the powers of the Secretary of State. We are, therefore, prepared to accept the first Amendment—I am in a very generous mood this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had better watch this carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the second Amendment, however, the issues are rather different. It would give the Secretary of State power to interfere with the detailed day-to-day work of the Board, and we think that this is not a good thing to do, and that we should leave the Bill as it is in this respect.<br><br>
This in some ways expresses a contradiction which seems to exist in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0592">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
minds of hon. Members opposite. On the one hand, they do not want the Secretary of State to approve of disposals, and on the other hand they put forward an Amendment to say that he should have the right to give detailed instructions about specific pieces of land. Our main opposition, however, to the Amendment is that it is a bad principle to introduce, and has not been generally accepted in legislation so far. The general principle is that we should not involve the Secretary of State in the detailed administration of public bodies of this kind. For that reason we cannot accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a short observation on the apparent inconsistency between Amendment No. 89 and our general line of argument? The Government say that in all cases there must be consent before land can be disposed of. The Amendment merely provides that when the Secretary of State considers it necessary he should come in and give directions. That is what I have described as a reserve power, which, I think, is necessary. However, if the Minister is satisfied that it is not necessary, I would be the last to press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that it was contradictory because it would take the initiative from the Board. The Secretary of State would have the initiative to say that a piece of land should be disposed of, and that is contrary to what hon. Members opposite have been arguing. I do not make this point in any acrimonious manner, but almost in the spirit of great friendship. Hon. Members opposite have been arguing that we should not interfere with the Board, but their Amendment would take the initiative from the Board and place it in the hands of the Secretary of State. We think that that is wrong and that the initiative should remain with the Board to do what it wishes with the land which it has for disposal, subject, of course, to the approval of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment does not do that. It provides a reserve power. It does not say that the Secretary of State will give directions about the disposal of land, but merely provides that he can if he thinks fit—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the initiative would be his.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is true, but in the Government's way he will always have to come in and give consent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, my hon. Friend is perfectly correct. As one who has been impartial this morning I may be able to give a verdict which is not influenced by either side, not even by the side on which I sit. I have been fascinated by the manoeuvres of the Opposition, and when I read the Amendment I thought that they were running in direct conflict with the general case which they have consistently argued. They have been claiming that the Board ought to have greater power than the Bill confers upon it, and yet they are now seeking to do the very thing which they are alleging that we are doing—giving the Secretary of State power over the Board's decisions. This Amendment is a pertinent example, and every Amendment which they have suggested to Clause 4 fortifies what I have said.<br><br>
The words which they now propose to leave out by Amendment 24 exalts the Board over the Secretary of State. The Board may consider something expedient and the Secretary of State may approve; but precedence is given to the Board. That is what the Opposition claim ought to be the position. They then reverse that attitude and say that the Secretary of State should have power to give directions to the Board, so that the Secretary of State is exalted over the Board, when the Bill seeks to do what the Opposition have constantly urged us to do.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The gyrations of hon. Gentlemen opposite are very difficult to follow. They were not prepared to force even the last Amendment to a Division. I welcome their conversion, and I hope that they will maintain this attitude throughout our discussions on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have enough bother following the generosity of the Minister, without trying to worry about the Opposition. Subsection (1)<i>(c)</i> says that the Board may,
<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Secretary of State, and subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, dispose of or otherwise deal with such land."</p></blockquote>
In view of the generous offer made by my hon. Friend, does this mean that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0593">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
Board can dispose of land without the approval of the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then what is the significance of allowing these words to go out now? What kind of disposal will not now be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiilis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that these words are not necessary. This was the case made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), and I accepted the argument that the Clause was not altered by deleting them. Under subsection 1<i>(c)</i> the approval of the Secretary of State will still be required for the disposal of land. I think that that answers the question asked by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also the case that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the subsequent provisions of this section",</p></blockquote>
are a reference to "sale, feu, lease or excambion"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for accepting Amendment No. 24, which was tabled as a result of a study of the Bill and other legislation by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). We have the advantage of his keen legal mind, and he was able to perceive that these words were not necessary.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has missed the point of the earlier Amendments, because the first two were specifically in the opposite direction to that which he suggested. We were asking that the words, "with the approval of the Secretary of State" should be taken out. The last Amendment, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, did not affect that position at all. We were asking for an explanation of some words which we thought were unnecessary. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that although we have made it clear that in general we consider that various parts of the Bill give the Secretary of State far too much power, and we would like to see the Board have more discretion, we are not inflexibly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
tied to doctrine, and, clearly, we must examine each matter on its merits.<br><br>
In this case there is the important question of the disposal of land after the Board has acquired it, and when, presumably, it no longer needs it. Because of a well-known case which arose about ten years ago, the Crichell Down case, there was subsequently arranged—I believe with the approval of Parliament, though I was not in the House at the time—a special procedure, the main point of which was to make sure that, if the Government had acquired land for a particular purpose, and then no longer needed it for that purpose, the original owner of the land, from whom it had been acquired by the Government by compulsion, would be given the first chance of taking it back before it was used for some other purpose by the Government. I think I am right in saying that at the time both sides of the House regarded that as an important matter of principle. It was a matter with which Parliament was much concerned, and, I am sure, still is.<br><br>
That is why—and I address this particularly to the hon. Member for Govan—we felt that in this important question of disposal there should be the chance for the Secretary of State to give a specific instruction if necessary, because this is a new Board, which was not in existence at the time of the Crichell Down case, and it may not be familiar with these procedures.<br><br>
We are not saying in the second Amendment that the Secretary of State shall direct in cases of disposal. We are merely making it clear that the power would extend to the Secretary of State to direct if he thought it necessary to do so, and the kind of occasion on which we foresee the Secretary of State may come in in this way is one when he feels that the rights of the individual, and in fact all the matters dealt with by the Franks Committee concerning the disposal of land, were not fully considered by the new Board in its enthusiasm to do the job which it is to be set up to do. If the Secretary of State thought that, quite unwittingly, the Board was offending against some of those principles, he could come in to guide it, to make sure that it would not steer the wrong course in disposing of land. That is why we tabled the second Amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0594">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
What we would like from the Minister—I realise that it may not be necessary to write this into the Bill as it is an administrative procedure—is an assurance that in any disposal of land under this Clause the procedure under which the original owner has the opportunity of having the first option to get the land back will be followed. That is the main purpose of the second Amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to give us the Government's views on this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the reason why this Amendment was tabled. It follows automatically that it would be necessary to have a subsection such as this if we had accepted the earlier Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue here is how best to do what the hon. Gentleman wants. We recognise the importance of land being disposed of in the correct manner, and of the various principles which we have discussed being followed, but, as the Bill is framed, the Secretary of State can ensure that they will be followed, because he has to approve the disposal. In fact, this is one of the points that I made in connection with the two earlier Amendments.<br><br>
Having rejected the earlier Amendment, there is no need for this subsection from the point of view of ensuring that the Secretary of State has power to see that these principles are followed. For this reason, in addition to the earlier ones, we think that the proposed new subsection should not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must place it on record that I think this is a very bad Clause, and I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has not taken up the question I raised about this matter of an appeal when land is acquired compulsorily. In my view, this is definitely an instance of the Secretary of State being judge in his own case, and I am not prepared to lend my name to an enactment of this sort. So I shall be compelled, as a protest, to vote against this Clause.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell me why, in view of his strong opposition to the Clause, he did not table an Amendment to reject it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister to answer two general points on the Clause, First, during our discussions on one of the Amendments he indicated that some general categories of case which might be decided under Clause 14(1) could overrule the specific approvals which are written into paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(c)</i> of subsection (1). As that was said merely in passing I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would confirm that the references to approval by the Secretary of State in those paragraphs could be neutralised—shall I say—by the directions under Clause 14, which would be for categories? This is an interpretation of the Bill which is possible, and I shall be glad to know the Government's view on the matter.<br><br>
Dealing with the general functions of the Board as they will be under the Clause, one sees that the Board is to be enabled to acquire, hold, manage and dispose of land anywhere in Scotland. In subsequent Clauses we shall find that it can erect buildings and do other things on, land so acquired. There is here, I think, a cause for some anxiety to which the Committee ought to pay attention, because I am sure that people in Scotland will pay attention to it, particularly those who are following closely the establishment of the Board, and its activities later on.<br><br>
My point is that the Board must itself be concerned mainly with the Highland area. I recognise from what the hon. Gentleman said earlier that we must not use the word "designated", so I call it the Highland area. What I mean is the Highland area as it will emerge from Clause 1—the original Highland area and the additions which may be made to it. The Board's duties will be concerned mainly with that area. It will no doubt be producing schemes and making suggestions for what might be done for what it thinks are genuine improvements in the area. In the course of doing that, the Board may feel it necessary to acquire and to hold land.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The part of this acquisition of land with which we are mainly concerned is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0595">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
the compulsory acquisition. There may well be a possible conflict of interests between some scheme which is to be carried out within the area and its effects outwith the area and in other parts of Scotland. The hon. Gentleman indicated that his idea was that the land might be acquired just over the border of the Highland area, but there are possibilities that the effects of a Board's scheme might affect other parts of Scotland some distance from the area, not just on the borders. There may be anxieties about the possible adverse effects of some scheme, proposed within the Highland area, on communities 40 or 50 miles away.<br><br>
In previous discussions we have made clear that we consider that close consultation should take place and the Board should be sensible of its duty to consult local authorities and other bodies outwith the Highland area if their interests appear to be affected, adversely or otherwise. I must make perfectly clear that we should not wish any local authority or body outwith the Highland area to be able to hold up or delay some welcome scheme which would be beneficial to the Highland area, but we wish to make sure that such authority has an opportunity to explain its point of view and that the scheme is carried out in such a way as to resolve any conflict of interests. Perhaps some not so necessary part of a scheme might be dropped.<br><br>
If the Board has this power to acquire land compulsorily outside the area, there is the possibility that, rather than go on arguing, it would be tempted to acquire the land compulsorily, if that happened to be a way to end the discussion. I am not saying that the Board would do so, but there must be anxiety that, because the main functions and duties of the Board are within the Highland area, it might be carried away by enthusiasm for a scheme in that area and not give so much attention to the interests of some area outwith its own area. If it has the power of compulsory acquisition all over Scotland there would be a genuine anxiety that the Board might decide to acquire land and settle the matter in that way. I hope that the Minister will address himself to this question and give us his views upon it. With all respect to the future Board, however well minded its members may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
be, and however efficient, they are bound to be particularly concerned with the schemes of the Board and not so much worried about other parts of Scotland. If it proved an easy way to deal with some decision or doubt outside its area the Board might take the easy course of resorting to compulsory acquisition. That is one of our main worries about the effect of this Clause and we should like to hear the views of the Minister on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of the latter remarks of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) show how wise we were to resist the Amendment designed to delete the need for the approval of the Secretary of State to be obtained. Obviously, one of the safeguards against the unnecessary acquisition of land throughout Scotland by the Board is that acquisition has to be approved by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In order to acquire land compulsorily, the approval of the Secretary of State is required in any case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And even for feuing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it is compulsory purchase about which we are mainly concerned. We suggested that the need for the permission of the Secretary of State to be obtained should be withdrawn in respect of another part of the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have safeguarded the position even in relation to the feuing and leasing of land outside the Highlands, but I will try to deal with points which have been raised.<br><br>
I forget how long the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) has been a Member of the House of Commons. I think that it is—something like 12 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember taking an active part in the by-election in his constituency in an endeavour to keep him out of the House. I think that was in 1953 or 1954–1957. This procedure has operated since then, and, as was pointed out by his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie), there have not been many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0596">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
complaints about the 1947 procedure. The point which was raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has been raised by other people, but there have been few, if any, complaints. However, I should not like to deter the hon. Gentleman from pursuing his crusade. I only remark on the fact that he did not pursue it with much vigour prior to the coming of this Government to office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister what his evidence is for that statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is what I am informed.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands, who has been a Minister, has said this. He has had legal experience which I imagine has brought him into these sorts of cases. He made the same point and there has not been a great deal of dissatisfaction about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered my point. I have always been opposed to this procedure. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to confirm my statement by asking a previous Secretary of State, the previous Member for Renfrew, West.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been a fairly regular attender at Committee meetings in the past—probably too frequent an attender for the happiness of some individuals. I cannot say I have noticed that hon. Members opposite have pursued this matter with great vigour.<br><br>
To return to the question of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn in relation to Clause 14(1) and the general approval that the Secretary of State should give, the Minister can give approval for the acquisition, we might say, of an area of land—say five or six acres—to be used as a car park. That would be possible under the provisions of the Bill. He could give approval for the acquisition of an area of land on which there was to be erected a tourist information bureau, or for the purposes which were suggested by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). All this could be done under Clause 14(1). I have no doubt, too, that if it appeared quite clear that it was desirable to give approval in connection with certain categories of act the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
Secretary of State would do it. I cannot imagine any Secretary of State wishing to be bothered with any more paper work than he gets at present.<br><br>
Regarding the other question which was raised by the hon. Gentleman concerning the acquisition of land, I promised at the last Sitting of the Committee that I would find out the position. At that time I gave my opinion about the acquisition of land in Scotland or elsewhere, but I promised my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) that I would not only inform the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, but the Committee.<br><br>
I was asked whether the Development Board would have power to acquire land compulsorily anywhere in the United Kingdom and whether it would be able to set up a tourist information centre in London. I said, on a quick consideration of Clauses 4 and 18, that I did not think it would be possible for the Board to acquire land compulsorily outside Scotland and also that I had some doubt as to its power to acquire land by agreement, but I promised to look further into this matter. I have done this, and I can now confirm that the Board's power to acquire land by compulsion could not be exercised outside Scotland.<br><br>
On the other hand, I am advised that the Board would not be precluded from acquiring land by agreement outside Scotland. This bears out the view expressed by the hon. and learned Member for Pentlands. Such acquisition must be for the exercise of the Board's functions, and this, in turn, would have to relate to the Highlands and Islands area. The effect of Clause 18(2), which I called in aid at the last meeting of the Committee, is that when the Bill becomes an Act it will affect only the law of Scotland, so that the exercise of powers of compulsory acquisition in England would be an interference with the rights of the proprietor under the law of England for which the Bill provides no warrant. The position is further reinforced by the application in Clause 4(2) of the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act, 1947, which also extends only to Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that there could be any question of compulsory acquisition outwith Scotland. It was the question of acquisition by agreement.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0597">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That could be done, as I have indicated. I should like to finish this statement so that it appears on the record.<br><br>
It follows, however, that any acquisition of land in England by agreement is in no way contrary to the law in England. The Board has by Clause 4(1,<i>a</i>) been given the necessary powers to acquire land, and no further provision is required to enable it to exercise these powers in England, or, for that matter, anywhere else within or outwith the United Kingdom—for instance, at the World Fair in New York—but always within the general confines of Clause 1(2) which states
<br><blockquote><p>"The area … in relation to which the functions of the Board shall be exercised shall be—"</p></blockquote>
the Highlands and Islands, as defined for the purposes of the Bill.<br><br>
I have given that explanation in order for it to be on the record—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wylie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister allow me also to put something on the record? I read with horror in yesterday's <i>Scotsman</i> that I had suggested compulsory purchase powers could be exercised in England. That is, of course, nonsense, and I hope that that will be put right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, and that is why I said the hon. and learned Gentleman did point out that under the provisions of the 1947 Act that would not be possible.<br><br>
As was indicated by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, the Board would be in a position to acquire land compulsorily anywhere in Scotland. The fact that this could be done only with the approval of the Secretary of State, is the first safeguard. I tried to explain what we had in mind. I think the Board has to have these powers, not in order to acquire land necessarily anywhere in Scotland or in neighbouring areas to the Highland area, simply in order to enforce its purpose on a particular area, but in order to meet the perfectly genuine needs it may have for an access road or some service on the borders of the area for which it is responsible. That, to me, seems a perfectly legitimate power to give to the Board if it is to have the necessary powers.<br><br>
During our discussions on Clause 3 I agreed to look at the wording of subsection (1,<i>b</i>) concerning consultations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
with the various local authorities in order that the words could be changed to include the local authorities concerned and not the local authorities in the Highland area alone. I have in mind the specific point made during our discussions that there was a case not for what the words in the Bill said, but for bringing in the local authorities or bodies concerned. Clearly that would include neighbouring local authorities. I hope that by Report stage we may think out a satisfactory form of words which would make it necessary for the Board to consult people or bodies concerned by proposals put to the Secretary of State. I think this would meet what the hon. Gentleman has suggested should be done in relation to this matter and would also provide yet another safeguard to prevent the abuse of the powers which we give to the Board under the provisions of the Clause. I hope that I have answered all the points which have been raised and that we may now get the Clause.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are glad to hear that there is no question of compulsory purchase of land in England and Wales. We had assumed that, but we are glad to have the Minister of State's statement about the acquisition of land outside Scotland in general.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But by voluntary agreement, the hon. Gentleman kens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We are glad to get the statement in general, which indicates that it is possible for the Board to obtain land by agreement in England and Wales. We are grateful to the Minister of State for having taken the trouble to look into this and for giving us this full statement for the record.<br><br>
What he has just said about consultation we see as a rather different matter, though we are glad to hear that he is considering a form of words for Report, as he indicated earlier that he might do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For Clause 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in no doubt, as we made clear earlier, that consultation with the local authorities concerned outwith the Highland area is very important. I must make it clear that we still consider that Clause 4 goes much too far, and quite unnecessarily so, in giving powers of compulsory purchase over the

whole of Scotland. We cannot see why this should be necessary, but we accept that it is appropriate that the Board should have these powers within the area for which it is responsible. We think that this Clause goes much too far in giving the Board these powers all over Scotland. We are not convinced by what the hon. Gentleman has said on this. We do not think that it is necessary, or that the reasons which he has advanced justify it. We would much prefer to see the Clause limited to the Highland area as defined in Clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) has put it on record that he thinks that the Clause goes much too far. I want to put it on record that I think that the Clause does not go far enough. I hope that is clear.<br><br>
In all my years in the House I have always noticed that when anyone speaks on any Clause or any Bill about acquisition and disposal of land the knees of every Tory begin to shake. Scratch any one of them, and out pops a landlord. We on this side are concerned with the people in the Highlands. The Opposition are concerned with owning the land of the Highlands. It is their treasure. Our business is to improve the welfare of those who live on that land. This is one thing that we must make clear. I used to be a member of a Y.M.C.A., a debating club. I always remember a speech—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just an illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Y.M.C.A. is not included in this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but with deference to the Chair, I submit, Mr. Steele, that not only is exposition part of a speech, but illustration is also essential to make the exposition clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So long as it is relevant to the matter under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very relevant, just a slight illustration. I shall quote the whole speech. It illustrates my point. I remember one of the members of that debating club rising to speak. He made a speech. This was his speech: "Landlordism is the curse of Scotland". That was the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
whole speech. He could not have said more than that. It is true. Every one of us knows it to be true. It was the beginning, the middle, the end—"Landlordism is the curse of Scotland". When we in this Committee suggest that the Board should have all the power which is necessary to acquire land, the Tory Party knocks at the knees.<br><br>
I want to see the Board having the power to acquire land, because I have already indicated that the business of the Board must have much wider limits than some hon. Members opposite think that it should have. Industry, in the development of the Highlands, must play a greater part in the future than it has ever played in the past. The debate on Second Reading showed that from the Highlands of Scotland there is a continual drain of people. Thousands of people leave every year. This process has been going on for years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Member must recognise that we have already dealt with certain Amendments dealing with industry and these other matters. This Clause concerns the acquisition and disposal of land by the Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we were acquiring land for the purpose of helping to stop that continual drain from the Highlands. We have emphasised during the discussion on the various Amendments on the Clause those very features of the Clause. That is its intention—to get land, to erect buildings, and to do all these other things which are necessary. I submit that we must make it clear in the Bill—this is one of the stages where we should make it clear—that merely proceeding along the lines of development that have characterised previous attempts to stop this outflow of people will not be sufficient. We must introduce a new approach. I have already said that that new development must be along the new industrial lines which are developing outside the Highlands. There is still the tendency, as has been said this morning, to regard the Highlands as a separate part of Scotland. It is part of Scotland, and must be developed along the lines that apply to the rest of Scotland and to England. It is essential that this should be said, and said at this point on this Clause, which deals with so many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0599">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
specific aspects of this development. That is why I have taken the opportunity of saying it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) has said constitutes an invitation to me to declare an interest. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the interest which I can declare in this is that, however hard he scratches me, he will find only about half an acre on the Moray Firth which constitutes grass and a few flower beds around my house.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not making any personal accusation, although I notice that the largest landowner on the Opposition side has kept out of the road this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have been speaking on the Clause, I would wish the hon. Gentleman to be quite certain what the position is.<br><br>
I would like to add, arising from what the hon. Gentleman has said, that it is</span></p>

Clause 5.—(ERECTION OF BUILDINGS AND PROVISION OF SERVICES ETC.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 98. I suggest that it might be for the convenience of the Committee if, with this Amendment, we discussed the hon. Member's Amendments No. 99, in page 3, line 32, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"assist, promote or undertake the construction or improvement of marine works and provide installations, equipment and services in connection with such works".</p></blockquote>
and No. 97, in line 32, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p><i>(d)</i> assist crofters and others in promoting, developing, maintaining and managing town-ship and regional moorland regeneration schemes.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to suggest that the Committee
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
not simply a matter of compulsory acquisition of land. I do not want to anticipate later Clauses, but we have made it clear on Second Reading that it is the combination of this Clause with, for example, Clause 6, which means that we are half way to taking over businesses and industries and generally deterring private enterprise, which has a place in the development of the Highlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has done nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has contributed. Earlier the Committee was considering the case instanced by myself and by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) of a private enterprise firm which had done much in the Highlands. There are other cases of the same kind.<br><br>
It is the combination of Clause 4 with what is coming later which we consider contributes to making the Clause far too wide.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 14, Noes 11.</p>
<p>might wish to follow that course. I welcome the idea. It slightly widens any opening speech, but I think it possibly cuts down later speeches.</p>
<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 32, at the end to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"assist, promote, or undertake the planting and maintenance of shelter belts".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The significance of these Amendments will not be lost upon Highland Members at all events; nor, I should think, upon Members interested in agriculture in particular, and Members interested in Highland areas, even outside the real Highlands and Islands.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 98 deals with shelter belts. The Amendment asks that the Board be enabled to
<br><blockquote><p>"assist, promote, or undertake"—</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0600">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
<p>that is a slightly controversial word—
<br><blockquote><p>"the planting and maintenance of shelter belts".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The reason for the Amendment arises partly from the disappointing progress which has been made with shelter belt planting, taking it all over the Highlands and Islands. There are—or were—limited certain powers under certain Acts to provide shelter belts, and private individuals are at liberty as landowners and even tenants, to do quite a lot in shelter belt planting. Taking the region as a whole, however, there has been very little shelter belt progress to report over the years. There is no area in Scotland or throughout Britain where this kind of development is more desirable and necessary than the Highlands and Islands.</p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p>There are many aspects involved in this problem, but I will concentrate on only three arguments. One is from the point of view of agricultural shelter—shelter for crops, and even more particularly for livestock. Another is from the point of view of improving amenity as much as possible, having tourism in mind; and the third is from the point of view of enhancing the natural beauty which in certain areas can be considerably furthered by the planting of shelter belts.</p>
<p>I am not thinking here in terms of small scrubby bushes or, at the other extreme, of great commercial timber developments, but of something on a smaller scale, more limited in scope and in particular areas. Among areas which require shelter belts most urgently are the districts most exposed to winds in the groups of Islands; and, therefore, I emphasise those island areas. There has been a certain amount of shelter planting in connection with some of the hill farming schemes through the years, but not nearly enough. Unfortunately, during past years the Forestry Commission, as I said in an earlier speech in Committee on a different occasion, has not been interested in shelter belt plantings o in what are described as the smaller "non-commercial" schemes. For many years the Commission thought in terms of 300 to 400 acres as a minimum and liked even that minimum associated, in turn, with more general planting, regionally, where larger plantations were undertaken.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
<p>It was a matter of great disappointment to all those of us who had for many years advocated smaller plantations from the point of view of shelter and enhancing natural beauty and for other considerations that the Forestry Commission was unable or unwilling to commit itself to shelter belt planting in smaller plantations. Latterly, after the last war, there was some association of shelter belts with hill farming schemes; but it seems a pity that we had, even then, virtually always to produce and organise a new hill farming scheme before we could get such assistance as the Department was able to offer in the planting of shelter belts. Such shelter plantings are often fully justified in themselves, quite apart from the comprehensive and organised hill farming schemes. I hope, therefore that some body will in future have continuing responsibility for the provision of shelter belts and for undertaking planting with the assistance of the specialists and experts at all levels of labour, management and administration. I would like to see that done among the new Board, the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Commission; and certainly local planning authorities should be consulted.</p>
<p>I want to see a conscious, deliberate and sustained campaign of shelter belt development throughout the Islands and Highlands. I am sure that that would be good for agriculture. It would certainly be good for all who are interested in livestock rearing; and it would do a great deal to assist in bringing into permanent pasture those areas which, without shelter, will never become what can legitimately be described as pasture. I will not go beyond that, as a later Amendment will deal also with the extension of moorland pasture; but, even in connection with the local schemes and the regional re-seeding schemes, which I am again proposing, it is desirable, not only from the point of view of drainage and of shelter, but also as a means of consolidation and protection of the schemes.</p>
<p>Again, from the point of view of amenlty and tourism there is no doubt at all about the situation. Ask anyone who goes to my own constituency, the Western Isles, what he most missed, in Natural amenity, and what he would like to have seen and the answer is always: trees. That is one area where even the saying, "A bird in the hand is worth two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0601">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
in the bush" does not apply, because there are plenty of birds but no bushes. It is an area where one notices as an almost dramatic gesture any shelter belt—planting at all, an area where a great expansion of such planting would greatly enhance its appearance.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the protection of crops and livestock it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of such planting in an area like the Western Islands; but this applies in many other parts of the Highlands and Islands with which I am familiar. There are vast exposed areas where a programme of planting on a sufficient scale, greatly speeded up, would prove a great blessing to all who are interested in crops and livestock. I have spoken on this subject for many years, in Committee and in the House. I can remember discussing it with Mr. Tom Johnston and Sir William Jowitt, as he was then, and everybody was enthusiastic about shelter belts. At that time one could almost imagine them in the immediate future sprouting along the Highland coasts and on every coastal fringe of the Western Islands. Both those men have now passed from the Parliamentary scene; but the trees are still waiting to be planted.</p>
<p>Today there is more consciousness of the need for trees and particularly for shelter belts in the Islands than I have ever known. At one time some of us who advocated this felt very lonely in argument and were looked upon almost as cranks; but today crofters' unions and communities in crofting villages are asking why nothing is being done. It is realised and known now that such plantations provide a natural shelter for crops and livestock, and many people are willing to participate actively in schemes of this kind, just as they have participated in re-seeding schemes for the regeneration of moorlands in Lewis and other areas. I am sure that that would prove the case here again if a decision were taken to go ahead with a programme of shelter belt planting. I hope that we may know what it is intended that the Board is to do in association with the Forestry Commission and to some extent with the Department of Agriculture in relation to forestry, and, particularly to shelter belts, which are of such great significance to agriculture as well as to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
other aspects of Highlands and Islands development.</p>
<p>The second Amendment has little to do with afforestation and shelter belts but this question, too, occupies an extremely important place in the consciousness particularly of people in Island areas. One cannot avoid realising that a jetty, pier, or quay is the beginning and end of every road in any Island and every road leading to and from the coast. I need not emphasise the importance to such areas of a suitable shelter, landing place, harbour works and equipment to meet the sea transport needs of these areas. Messrs. MacBrayne's themselves, experienced as they are in Western Islands and Highlands services, have, at times, not been able to provide certain services, they would have been willing enough to provide, just because of the lack of proper quays, piers and equipment. Sometimes such marine works were too expensive for the company to undertake and, even where they might have been willing to undertake them, it was not always possible to persuade the Scottish Office and the Treasury to look at such schemes. An Island area without proper jetties and quays finds its whole economic and community life gravely crippled and feels sharply the absence of proper landing places and handling facilities and equipment for! such purposes as those of the fish industry, for travel and communications, for landing goods brought across the water and for the loading of goods going from the Island.</p>
<p>From every point of view it is essential that every Island should have at least one suitably equipped landing place and harbour. This was a recommendation many years ago by the Highlands and Islands Advisory Panel. The White Paper laid before the House in 1950 which was unanimously accepted by all parties without a whisper of argument, let alone dispute, recommended that every island area should have a suitable and adequate pier or jetty.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a most interesting speech but keeps referring to islands. While I entirely agree that every island should have a safe anchorage and good landing facilities, would he not agree that there is an equally strong case in relation to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
some inaccessible peninsulas, where there is no other landing place within 30 miles, and where the roads are very inadequate? Such places, too, should have suitable piers and jetties. In some areas those which have broken down have not been rebuilt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously my hon. Friend has again spent his holidays in Ardnamurchan. I sympathise, of course, with his point; but, if he listened to the earlier part of my speech I believe he will have heard me say that every road leading to and from the coast, as well as those in the Islands, generally leads, or should, to a jetty or harbour. I agree with what my hon Friend has said and I hope it will be understood that in my remarks I am embracing the Highlands and the Islands.<br><br>
In the 1950 White Paper the recommendations in regard to Highland transport and fishery piers mentioned not only the Islands, but many other places on the Highland mainland. The sad thing is that in many cases these recommendations, going back to 1950, have still not been met. The Island of Barra at its northern end is without any decent pier, jetty or harbour. Correspondence in relation to this has been going on for very many years and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) knows this very well, because it is not long since he himself, as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, was interrupted in the course of correspondence with me and the local councils, in which he was trying to be helpful, as he was in all such cases.<br><br>
Anyone here who is interested in the Isle of Barra will be interested to know that, after all the years of argument about an adequate jetty at its northern end—argument in which everyone from himself to Sir Compton Mackenzie and others have been concerned—the question has now been referred for yet another examination, this time to the Highland Transport Board, which no doubt in due course will put a sentence or two about it in their Report, which will, in turn, be passed to the Highland Development Board. I hope, indeed, that that will be done, and soon, and that it will be possible now to get some assurance on the scope of the functions, responsibilities and duties of the Highland Development
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
Board, in relation to such specific problems, neglected by others.<br><br>
That is my purpose in speaking to this Amendment. I should like to know what are to be the responsibilities, not only powers, of the Board in such problems. It is easy to say that it is a statutory responsibility of the local authority to deal with piers and harbours. In some cases that is true but the owners of some piers, harbours and jetties are private individuals; and, indeed, the ownership of many of them cannot be ascertained at all. That has been one of our difficulties. In some places no one would admit to owning a dilapidated pier. Sometimes where one finally traced an owner there arose at once the question of compensation for demolition of a dilapidated pier before building another from funds which had to be provided by the Department of Agriculture and the County Council. The owners of many piers, however, are still unknown to any authority. Some have obviously been abandoned, and some owners are afraid to admit responsibility for their ownership and maintenance, and some ownerships have passed from living memory. One result of this mystery about ownership is that nothing at all is done.<br><br>
One important populated area of the Outer Islands, in Lewis, used to be an important deep-water fishing centre with a harbour and pier and quite a good protective seawall. Today there is, to all intents and purposes, only the deep water. No one quite knows who owns the pier and so no one wants to take a decision about erecting a new one or restoring the old one. There are many similar examples on the mainland and in the Islands.<br><br>
There is one other aspect on which the Board may be able to help. Under the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act local authorities have power to do many things in connection with running public, time-tabled ferry services, which require some marine works and installations. To make such services effective some basic equipment, at least, is required. The Act could be a good one, if used.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Let us take the instance of the Island of Vatersay—and I hope that it is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
going to be called Battersea again on this occasion by the reporters—in the Outer Hebrides where the Department itself is the owner of the Vatersay estate, the whole Island. Under the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services, Act, the local authority has full power to employ almost any responsible person, or itself, to undertake the running of a regular, time-tabled, public ferry service to and from Castlebay. There is quite generous provision in the way of help under that Act. But although I have tried several times to get the local authority interested and I have put pressure on it through Ministers of the Scottish Office, the county council does not appear to be interested and the owners will not do it. Therefore, apparently, there is to be no ferry service of any kind there and none of the associated marine works necessary for the purpose.<br><br>
In the meantime, in the same little island of Vatersay there had been hatching for years and years proposals and plans for building one decent little jetty for this community of very active lobster fishermen. That community has been dwindling over the years because people will no longer tolerate impossible physical working conditions in their fishing industry. The younger people, and the people of the island generally, are fed up with the hardships associated with the lack of proper landing places, a proper jetty and proper harbour facilities, the lack of which involves climbing over rocks and considerable physical discomfort before they can put out to fish or leave the island.<br><br>
Some official responsibility must surely be taken for such projects by somebody at some time, and preferably a continuing responsibility. If the county council is not prepared to do it, or not able, or not allowed by the Treasury and the Scottish office itself to undertake jobs of this kind, there is surely a gap which has to be filled by somebody, a gap in responsibility and a gap in resources for the purpose.<br><br>
I suggest that the Highlands and Islands Development Board could probably do nothing better in the very early part of its active life than undertake, not only the planning of the big jobs which we have all been talking about in connection with the land and industry and so on, but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
a large number of smaller schemes right around the Islands and Highlands; schemes in themselves small, but to these small and dwindling communities essential and long overdue. The Board could give itself a boost which would be very desirable, for it would start out then with a great measure of prestige if it were seen to be interested in the local difficult jobs, which had long been dodged or delayed, and had the power and finance to undertake them, while planning the bigger schemes which will necessarily take a good deal of time to work out and develop.<br><br>
With all the good will in the world, it has been proclaimed by all Governments that it is their policy to keep population in the Highlands and Islands. That is the proclaimed policy of all parties. Here in this Bill is a token, at least, of the Labour Government's serious intentions and earnestness in carrying out its policy and programme and doing the things in the Highlands and Islands which would enable that policy to succeed.<br><br>
If the Board concentrates only on developments like Fort William and on other central growth points and on the large industries which we all, of course, want to see, there will, nevertheless arise the danger of even more depopulation from the outer islands and the coastal area and the peninsulas in the more inaccessible areas of the mainland, unless conditions and places are made liveable in for the smaller populations who want to live in their own places and not to drift away to Fort William, or Glasgow, or across the seas, as so many thousands of them have done in past years because of economic necessity and poverty and unemployment.<br><br>
If these areas are enabled to retain the populations who want to stay there, I can assure the Committee that the populations will stay there, given employment and the ordinary facilities of civilised living which they rightly demand in the 60s of this century. Very few, including even the young people, would then want to go to the bright lights of the cities. That is my experience and I speak as one of them.<br><br>
It may well be that hon. Members who do not know the Highlands and Islands imagine that simply because so many of the young people have been to the cities and returned home, they will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
want to go to the cities permanently. As long as amenities are denied to the outlying areas, the people there will shout all the more loudly for what they have seen in other places where such amenities have been taken for granted for years. That is natural enough. But that does not mean that these people want to leave their own home areas, but only that they want to enjoy at their home villages the amenities of modern living which they have seen enjoyed in the urban areas. Surely it is not unreasonable that they should ask for them.<br><br>
I want finally to refer to regeneration schemes. This is an important subject from every point of view. Earlier I looked up the Bills definition of "land". For a number of years "land" has been defined as including land covered by water. I do not suggest that we should nationalise the Continental Shelf for the purposes of the Bill, or that we should annex the two States in Ireland; but I cannot imagine that there is a reasonable political or idealogical case against the Board being able to do things which we suggest it ought to have the powers and duty to do under Amendment No. 97, that is to say, to assist crofters and others in promoting, developing, maintaining and managing township and regional moorland regeneration schemes. Each of those words in the Amendment has a significance of its own which hon. Members can argue if they will. They will, however, I feel sure agree that one of the most hopeful developments in the Highlands and particularly in the islands and especially in the Island of Lewis has been the moorland regeneration schemes.<br><br>
In the Island of Lewis there has been going on a great pioneering drive to reclaim hitherto useless bogland and moorland. A dramatic change has overcome the area. Over the last ten years, thousands upon thousands of acres have turned from brown to green, as it were. This is a dramatic change which strikes one visually and which strikes the imagination, and which in every way is a desirable development, which should now be developed on a much larger scale.<br><br>
There have been certain little discouragements in the past two or three years which were not anticipated at the begin-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
ning of this drive to reclaim and regenerate moorland in the Islands and there is now some danger of a setback. The danger arises because grants in aid of regeneration schemes are made payable over only two years. It is almost universally accepted that all these schemes require three years at the minimum and preferably four in order to do the regeneration job and follow up with reasonable consolidation. That is vital, or there is always a certain danger of reversion to bog and moorland—and nothing would be more tragic than that—if aid and enthusiasm wane.<br><br>
In past years, we have seen certain industrial enterprises—the famous, or notorious, Lord Leverhulme case was one—which have become memorials to failure. But the failure was not in the Western Isles, but somewhere many thousands of miles away. In that case of Leverhulme's the failure was in the firm's vast ventures in Africa. In agriculture above all we do not want there to be any sort of failure or memorial to failure, if that can be avoided, and I do not see why it should not be avoided. I could argue this for a long time, but that would not be fair or desirable, at this stage of the morning's sitting. But failure to appreciate the importance of helping to finance consolidation of the reseeding schemes could well involve the loss of much of the value of that money spent on the first stages of the regeneration job.<br><br>
What happens at present is that the crofters get a grant for only two years, working generally in co-operation as communities. They are then suddenly thrown back completely on their own financial resources, often sadly lacking financial resources. From that moment onwards, before the consolidation stage can be actively reached and completed, it would pay the Government Departments concerned to extend the grant for at least a further year in order to hold what has been gained from the barren moorland and bog and to make it into rich pasture land, as regeneration can. I have seen the stock in these island reseeded areas rising in numbers and quite visibly also in quality; and it is a wonderful thing to see this development made possible only by the co-operation of the crofters and whole villagers. But there is discernable here and there some tendency at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0605">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
moment to lose heart after so much hard work on these regeneration schemes, and it is difficult to sustain the enthusiasm these co-operative schemes need to keep them going, when the financial support is suddenly withdrawn after two years and the crofters are thrown back entirely on their own resources if they are to complete the work which has been begun.<br><br>
Continuity of responsibility and of supervision and at certain times of management of these schemes is needed in cases of this kind. Clearly, the crofters themselves cannot always do it, especially if we develop the very large schemes, as we should. For one thing, management involves a certain amount of technical expertise and experience of administration and a trained business sense, which the crofters do not always have and which it is difficult to exercise anyway as a community.<br><br>
I know that it is provided in the Bill that advice, clerical, technical and administrative and so on, is to be made available to enterprises which are set up, but this is something of a rather different character and it calls for long continuity. It calls for direct and continuous contact with the people in these schemes and for assistance beyond the point of reclamation or regeneration alone. It calls for assistance financially and in every practical form right to the point of marketing, which is where the crofters are again at a disadvantage, partly because of lack of transport, adequate or reasonably priced, but partly also because of lack of experience in this respect when they run straight into competition with the buying element, which is far more experienced and far more organised than the crofters, whose actual experience is often limited to the raising of their store cattle and associated work.<br><br>
It is extremely important that some body should be given the duty and responsibility of looking continuously after these schemes—financially, administratively and in the practical work in the field itself. This is extremely important. It is clearly one job which the county councils cannot do. It is a job which the Department and its agencies can do only up to the point of passing on the grants and then, in respect of reseeding, stopping them after the second year. It is a job in which the Crofters Commis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
sion has a very limited function, which could just as well be carried out in many ways by the Department of Agriculture for the so-called Commission grants are merely a transfer to a large extent of the old Departmental "Santa Claus Act" of paying out the subsidies and subventions.<br><br>
The Crofters Commission has a very limited function largely also because it does not have a sufficiently large or adequate or expert field staff. It is endlessly borrowing from the Department and using the Department land officers and so on, with no adequate independent staff of its own in the field. It will never be able to carry out its functions fully, as it would wish to, because its relations with the Department of Agriculture are such that it will always be subject to the overriding policy decisions of the Department and Ministers. I do not think that that is wholly avoidable; but we should seize every chance to change this and get rid of these restrictions.<br><br>
The Minister no doubt knows that the Labour Party's policy in agricultural aid will do a bit of good in the Islands especially because of the increase in the cropping grant and help with hay and so on, and he will get very few complaints from crofters in these areas regarding the Price Review, particularly in the areas where there are regeneration schemes. In other words, the Price Review's policy has helped the progressive crofters in regeneration scheme areas. Their main complaint is about the lack of a little extension—of one year—to assist in the consolidation of their moorland regeneration schemes. Nobody takes responsibility for that cost once the second year grant has been paid. There is, of course, valuable technical advice from the college of agriculture and the Department, if asked. But that is not the only sort of thing which is wanted at this point. We get good advice from many dedicated people; but the trouble is that there is a danger of seeing much of this work of reseeding falling back in time. There is some danger of ultimate reversion to bog land, and I am sure that nobody wants to see that.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Consolidation, therefore, is vitally important; but so also is the extension of this so-called experiment in reseeding.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0606">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
It is no longer an experiment. We know that it can be successfully done. We know that there have been weaknesses in some jobs; and that it has been subject to certain abuses, but, even having regard to all these things, and not minimising any of them, surely now is the time to carry out moorland regeneration on a regional basis?<br><br>
I call in evidence and support what was said by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). Shortly before he became Secretary of State he made an inspired and inspiring speech advocating regional regeneration schemes on the largest possible scale. He said what I and others in the Western Isles had been saying for many years, that what is needed is a great expansion, mechanisation, a sense of permanence, of continuity, and further financial as well as moral support. But he went further. I am not going to quote the right hon. Gentleman's speech because I quoted it in the House shortly after he became Secretary of State. That was too good an opportunity to miss.<br><br>
What prevented the right hon. Gentleman putting into operation what he said was necessary? When he became Secretary of State, he was obviously in favour of the policy that he had advocated, but he must have found that it was impossible to put it into practice with the existing agencies and with the resources and equipment that were available. He may also have been limited by the existing statutory provisions, or lack of such provisions.<br><br>
It is obvious that something important is missing; and we must make every effort to use the Board in the best possible way to encourage and extend greatly something which is more than an experiment, and is now an operating success. This is not an ideological matter. I am sure that 90 per cent. of the Highland landlords would willingly see the more marginal crofting land nationalised. That statement is often made by them in private conversation; but whether it would be made on their behalf in this Committee is another matter.<br><br>
There is no real ideological or party clash here. From the point of view of the availability of land for regeneration purposes, there surely should be no party clash. I consider that everybody should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
support the idea of giving the Board greater powers than has so far been envisaged, to assist it in doing what the right hon. Member for Argyll rightly said should be done, and what I, too, and many others also have said many times needs to be done, regeneration on the grand scale.<br><br>
I think that the time has now come for very large regional regeneration schemes to be carried out, and for somebody to be made responsible for them to see that they are successfully and properly carried out. Somebody should be made responsible also for seeing that the increased number of cattle which will result from these regeneration schemes are efficiently and properly transported and marketed.<br><br>
With a programme of regional regeneration, one would want to see mechanisation and the training of local people to do a full-time skilled job of carrying out that programme. For example, in the Isle of Lewis and Harris, I should like to see a number of local people, even, perhaps, one-fiftieth of the local young male population, employed full time as trained agricultural operators, employed permanently on a regional project, fully mechanised, with area fencing and drainage, under the continuing responsible management of some body charged with the overall task of carrying out the policy and programme we have in mind.<br><br>
It is no use leaving this to haphazard individual development, or even at the stage of co-operative township development, because, owing to the discouragements over the last year or two, steady progress may not be fully maintained. I therefore commend the Amendments to the Committee, and hope that the Board will be charged with the responsibility for the success of these schemes which have proved so successful already, and which could be adopted regionally to the benefit of the whole Highlands and Islands area and population in crofting agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments, like a number of others, call for a closer definition of what the precise activities of the Board are to be. I have no doubt that the Minister will say that all the necessary power is there already. Nevertheless, it is desirable that it should be said that the Board will do good, and we would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
like to hear what kind of good it will do.<br><br>
I have a question to ask on each of the three Amendments which we are discussing. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) argued the case for sheltered planting. If the Board wanted to take over an estate and operate it as an integrated enterprise between forestry and agriculture, it would be able to do so. Who would run it for the Board if it did that? Would the Department of Agriculture be called on to do the job? Would the Board attempt to do it itself, or would it set up an agency to do the job? If, for instance, the Board decided that the Applecross Peninsula could be developed by some sort of joint enterprise involving both forestry and agriculture, how would it set about doing this?<br><br>
My second question concerns Amendment No. 99. Having listened with great admiration and a certain amount of surprise to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And learned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No more learned than anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hen. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—I was not in the least surprised to find in Clause 17 that land means water. If the legal definition of land includes water, does it include land under the sea? I understand that there is no problem with regard to land between the high tide mark and the low tide mark, but what is the position when one wishes to develop a project which extends into the sea? Will the Board have power to build marine works?<br><br>
The hon. Member for the Western Isles talked about the building of piers. What about fish farms? What about breakwaters which may well be required, and which have to be constructed on the sea bed?<br><br>
My third question concerns regeneration schemes. When this Committee first met I received a letter from the Landowners' Federation. I think that it was a circular letter, which was sent to all hon. Members. I do not have it with me because, frankly, I did not expect the Committee to get as far as this so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
quickly, due to the well-known verbosity of both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
The letter gave the impression that a meeting had taken place with the Minister, and that he had indicated that the Board would not be involved in any extensive reclamation schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember the precise wording of the letter, but I shall send it to the Minister. I should like an assurance on that point. I should have thought that it would be desirable for the Board to involve itself in such schemes. I think that it should have a moveable unit, but, as far as I know, the Forestry Commission is the only organisation which has heavy ploughs capable of dealing with the reclamation of peat and bog land. What will be the rôle of the Board in land reclamation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the excellent and intelligent case made for these Amendments by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan). I propose to deal particularly with Amendment No. 97, because the other two were dealt with at length by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Subsection 1<i>(c)</i> says that the Board may
<br><blockquote><p>"hold, manage, maintain, hire, let or otherwise dispose of such works, equipment or services."</p></blockquote>
The intention of the Amendments is to highlight and illustrate some of the problems which exist and to make sure that the powers given in the Bill will be used to the extent that is necessary to deal with these various problems.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) usually makes an intelligent speech, and I was horrified to hear him refer to the danger of businesses being taken over, and about power being given to take over businesses. Surely he is aware of the fact that many businesses would have failed if they had not been rescued by public money? Surely he is aware that had it not been for public money there would have been even greater depopulation than there has been so far? Is the hon. Gentleman aware of what the Scottish Co-operative Board has accomplished by taking over family businesses which were failing? I mention that to show that this power is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0608">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
necessary to avoid a repetition of what has happened in the past.<br><br>
We are all aware of the hopes which were raised by the regeneration scheme in Lewis, and the benefits which were gained from it. Many of us felt that we had reached a stage in regeneration which was really worth while. My hon. Friend referred to his fears about not getting the necessary assistance in the years ahead to reap the full benefits of that experiment. The purpose of Amendment No. 97 is to
<br><blockquote><p>"assist crofters and others in promoting, developing, maintaining and managing township and regional moorland regeneration schemes."</p></blockquote>
I want the Minister to be seized of the importance of this proposal if it becomes a reality. It will not, however, become a reality without a great deal of effort and financial support for the Board once it begins its operations.<br><br>
We have been told that the Board will set up development schemes for regional areas. I presume, and, indeed, I hope, that they will not be too large. They will have to be large in some areas, but it will be a bad thing if they are large in others. Can my hon. Friend tell me whether any assessment has been made in connection with the areas to be developed by the Board? Has any assessment been made by the Crofters' Commission, the Forestry Commission, the Department of Agriculture, or the Highland Panel?<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I am wondering whether there is an accumulation of information. I know that some information exists, but I do not know whether there is the necessary information. We have had many Reports on the Highlands but when we get down to minute details about areas we find that the statistical information about them is not extensive. There are many areas where stretches of peat exist and I should like to know whether we have any information about the depth of the peat in those places. There has been an attempt at regeneration by skimming off the peat, and the problem has been attacked by the use of rotary blades, sand, and the lime content of shells. The mechanisation work has been carried out under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture. I cannot imagine the Board doing that work, but it must be the motive power behind all the other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
organisations carrying out work in connection with the regeneration of the Highlands.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister of State, whose enthusiasm for the Highlands is well known, is fully seized of the idea that when an area is decided on for a development scheme, the fullest assessment should be made of its economic possibilities so as to ensure that when the area is made viable the best use will be made of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest and approval to the speech of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and to the speeches of hon. Members who followed him. I entirely agree with the purposes and aims of the three Amendments. The only thing about which I am uncertain, and upon which I have an open mind, is whether the Board is the right body to provide the help which is undoubtedly needed.<br><br>
In connection with shelter belts the hon. Member mentioned hill farming schemes. I do not think it is any longer possible to initiate a hill farming scheme, as the relevant legislation has been repealed and I do not think that anything has yet replaced it. There remains the Forestry Commission. It is true that the Commission does not like taking on small schemes, but it may be induced to do so upon occasions. There is no doubt that a reasonable official will help with Shelter belts on a small scale. The Commission has the equipment, the experience and the knowledge and it seems to me an open question whether this task might not better be left to the Commission. Alternatively financial assistance could be provided as is done for the owners of private woodlands; a case would be made out for the Forestry Commission or private owners acting as the agent of the Board. I should be interested to hear what the Minster of State has to say on this point.<br><br>
Whether we are concerned with the Islands or the mainland a very strong case can certainly be made out for the provision of piers, breakwaters, jetties and marine installations of all kinds. Notoriously communications in the Highlands "have their feet in the sea", and there is no doubt that marine installations and the provision of better piers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0609">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
would enable us to make a considerable improvement to our communications. I speak from experience when I say that there is nothing more expensive than trying to keep a pier in some sort of repair. It is well beyond the means of almost any private owner—no wonder a lot of them are "lying doggo" and trying to pretend that piers do not belong to them. It is also a severe burden on a local authority. There are several local authorities in my constituency who suffer from the burden of having to maintain a pier. It is true that pier dues may be charged, but that is never very popular. Such a procedure would probably come better from the Board, if it wished to recoup itself, than from a private owner or a local authority.<br><br>
I have no doubt that there is a lot which could be done all over the Highlands regarding the restoration of piers which have been allowed to fall into disrepair. If the necessary finance were available these piers could be restored and communications improved. It seems to me that the Board, with its powers, could well be the right body to undertake these tasks. I think that it is now the Ministry of Transport—it used to be the Board of Trade—which has certain responsibilities in this connection although I have never found the Ministry at all inclined to take any initiative in the matter.<br><br>
I agree strongly about the need for land regeneration. Wherever we go in the Highlands we find what used to be fields, where crops have been grown within living memory, but which, through lack of improvement, have now gone back and become bogs or patches of rushes. We must remember, as has been rightly pointed out, that if schemes are not continued over the years, land will quickly revert to its original state and become useless for any agricultural purpose.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for the Western Isles, and with what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) who has spoken and written a great deal on the subject, that a regional scheme is needed. The heavy ploughs and other equipment needed for drainage are beyond the means of most ordinary farmers, and it would not be economic to operate them except over an extensive area. The same applies
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
to the use of aircraft or helicopters. If we could discover an effective bracken spray these would be of enormous value, but the use of such things is not economic unless they are employed over an extensive area.<br><br>
A strong case can be made for a central pool of regional equipment, including heavy drainage equipment of one kind or another, which might be put at the disposal of crofters and smallholders as well as the larger farms. It could be operated over several farms at the same time. I suppose that this is something which might be done by the Department, but so far it has not been done. The Department has preferred to operate through subsidies which, when properly used, may prove very useful but are not always properly used. The equipment has to be transported often long distances from one part of the country to another at considerable expense and I think that it would be better to have a pool operated on a regional basis. Again, I have an open mind on this point but I think that this is also something which might possibly be done by or through the Board, unless the Government have other proposals for the Department of Agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am 100 per cent. in favour of shelter belts and I am 1,000 per cent. in favour of reseeding. The only thing in these Amendments about which I would quarrel is that the Board should be asked to undertake the planting and maintenance of shelter belts, or the promotion and managing of re-seeding. I think it of great importance that there should not be duplication, or the lines crossed in this matter.<br><br>
I doubt whether I could produce stock to anything like the extent that I do without the assistance of shelter belts, even in the Lowlands where it is a good deal less cold and windy, at the foot of Soutra Hill, than in the Western Isles. Anyone who has visited the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) will know that there may be seen a fine piece of integrated forestry and farming in Glenlivet. It has proved of the greatest benefit, and the farming community, which at first was suspicious of the idea, is now asking whether more can be done. Anyone who has seen that cannot have the slightest doubt about the wisdom of the principle behind the Amendments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0610">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
I should have thought that the Forestry Commission would be perfectly capable of doing the work. We have been told that it cannot get enough land. I remember a debate on forestry last July when the Minister of State told us with some vigour that the main difficulty was that the Forestry Commission could not get enough land, and I think that is true. But we should not underrate the fact that there is a vast amount of land available which, according to my information, is not entirely suitable for farming; it may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
be remote, too high or too cold. Land is to be made available under the powers which the Board is being given, and, therefore, if the difficulty is merely one of a shortage of land, I do not see the necessity for saying that the Board—</span></p>
