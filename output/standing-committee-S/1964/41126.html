OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed [24th November],</i> That the Chairman, do now report to the House that the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Bill has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.—<i>[Mr. Willis.]</i></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that I am the first speaker. All the congratulations that need to be expressed were expressed at our last meeting, so may I be permitted to skip that part of the programme, other than to say that I to some extent envy and congratulate the Opposition on having the privilege and pleasure of opposing Measures which come before the Committee from time to time. That is sometimes a much more delightful exercise than being on this side and trying to put Measures through the Committee. Having said that I do not wish to weary the Committee by further congratulating anybody, nevertheless, I associate myself with the remarks which have been made.<br><br>
There is one group of people who were very much criticised on Tuesday and who, in my opinion, ought to be congratulated rather than criticised. I refer to members of river purification boards. The Members of this Committee do not appreciate the excellent work that those people have done in trying to bring about that co-ordination of local authorities which was absolutely essential, nor do hon. Members appreciate the difficulty of the task which was placed upon the shoulders of those people in setting up a completely new organisation for this purpose. They had to get offices, officials, engineers' reports, and so forth. That took a considerable time. I speak with some personal knowledge, having been one of the founder members, together with the former Member for Glasgow, Pollok, Sir John George,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
of the Forth River Purification Board. I recognise the amount of work those boards did. If any blame has to be placed upon anyone's shoulders for the state of rivers today, it certainly cannot be placed upon the shoulders of members of river purification boards.<br><br>
I am inclined, like my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), to apportion the blame in the opposite way. The Government and the Secretary of State at that time took far too long to set up the river purification boards which were permissive under the 1951 Act. If the boards had been put into operation when the Act was passed or when the Conservative Government then came into being, I am sure that many of the problems confronting us today would not be there. The members of river purification boards deserve some credit for the work they have done.<br><br>
Rivers cannot be cleared without altering the method of approach. The method of approach in the past was that every small local authority was called upon to provide sewage purification works for its own domestic sewage. This approach gives rise to duplication of work. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) said that at present there is a considerable scarcity of qualified engineers. That to some extent adds to the problem.<br><br>
I should like to know from the Under-Secretary how many schemes have been submitted for his approval by local authorities for the alteration or provision of new sewage purification works. How long did it take the previous Secretary of State to decide whether those works could proceed and the amount of grant to be made available to local authorities? With that information we shall have at least some indication of what the attitude of the former Secretaries of State has been in the past.<br><br>
I believe that something more should be done than is proposed in the Bill. River purification boards should be set up in a different manner. They should become more or less independent powers, not the co-ordinating power envisaged in previous Acts and in the Bill. If the problem is to be solved, there must be some overriding authority so as to bring about the co-ordination of sewage purification works which is necessary and also bring industrial effluent into the works
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
provided by the co-ordinating authority. I cannot see how it will be able to solve the problem unless that is done.<br><br>
One of the great problems confronting local authorities and river purification boards at present is how to get co-ordination between various local authorities. I can illustrate this very well in relation to the River Forth. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) complained about certain effluent flowing into the tidal waters of the Forth from the upper reaches of the River Carron and the River Forth, and so on. This problem is due primarily to the fact that there is no power to compel co-operation between local authorities. On the Carron there is Denny. One comes down to Bonny-bridge. There is the whole of the Bonny-bridge area. Then one comes down to Falkirk, Larbert, and Stenhousemuir, all along the river. They are all more or less separate authorities, but a degree of co-operation certainly exists. On the River Forth one goes up to the Bridge of Allan. One then comes down to Stirling, Alloa and Bannockburn. Then one comes right down to Grangemouth. Each local authority naturally considers the problem from its own point of view. This will continue under the Bill. This is a fundamental mistake when trying to legislate for the purification of rivers.<br><br>
There is a problem in relation to the domestic effluent going into rivers which has not been solved. It can be solved to a certain extent, but it is being added to all the time. I refer to the soap products of the various soap manufacturers. This in itself causes a very great problem in river purification.<br><br>
The problem of industrial effluent is almost insurmountable for the paper industry. A great deal of money and effort have been expended on trying to get the effluent from paper mills down to reasonable proportions, but it is difficult to evolve a system by which the soda used in the purification and washing of paper can be wholly extracted. This is a problem of some magnitude to an area such as Denny. The paper mills there were established many years ago. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) suggested that the sewerage pipe from the paper mill of an industrial unit should be taken three miles
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
out into the tidal waters of the river, but that would involve a considerable cost, a cost which could not be borne by the industry. It would mean the stoppage of this industry which is very important to Stirlingshire and the surrounding area of Scotland.<br><br>
I speak with some experience, because before I entered the House we in the local authority considered this problem very carefully in co-operation with the paper manufacturers of Denny. We found that to take a pipe from the Denny paperworks down to the tidal waters of the Forth, which is not going three miles out into the sea, would at that time have cost £1¼ million. That was not the only problem confronting the local authority and the paper industry. Once one started piping water which had gone through the process of purifying the paper it would have left the Carron absolutely dry. The water which flows in a river such as the Carron is compensation water coming from the Carron Reservoir. That reservoir, as the former Secretary of State must know, plays a very important part in the development of the new town of Cumbernauld. Regard must be paid to the many circumstances and difficulties inherent in trying to operate a Bill such as this.<br><br>
It would be far better for Scotland as a whole if some contamination still took place in certain of our rivers, if this kept in being the industry upon which we all so much depend. One must be reasonable and considerate when trying to introduce a Measure such as this. That is why I concur with the point of view which has been expressed about Clause 1(4), regarding the words in the previous Act that "consent shall not be unreasonably withheld". That should not be omitted from the contents of the Bill. I do not think that what was said by the Government spokesman provides a satisfactory answer. I counsel the Government to reconsider this problem. It is easy merely to put into operation the strict letter of the law. I want to know whether the Secretary of State, to whom appeals can be made, has power to alter the law, because I am sure that the opinion of every hon. Member is that the law is made to be upheld by members of the Government and by members of the public. Therefore, the law as we lay it down would have to be interpreted by any Secretary of State and he would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
not have room to manœeuvre if the provision were omitted from the Bill.<br><br>
I am not happy about the Measure. I do not think that this is the proper way to try to solve this very difficult problem for Scotland. It has not solved it in the past. I do not think that it will solve it in the future. The only way to solve the problem is to have powers vested in a co-ordinating body such as a rivers purification board for the catchment area of, say, the Forth. Such a board should have full executive powers to make decisions on sewage purification both domestically and industrially.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Angus and Nearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) referred to a very important section of the community, the farming community. Farmers may have some difficulty in meeting the requirements of the Bill. We must have regard to these difficulties, not only as farmers but as members of the community. None of us knows enough to be able to say that the nature of some of our fertilisers is such that, after filtering through the soil, they will do no harm to man or beast.<br><br>
We use fertilisers extensively, and, if we did not, the productivity of our farms would be greatly retarded. So we are between the devil and the deep sea. We use the fertilisers and they ultimately percolate through the soil into the rivers and streams, bringing about a contamination which no one at this stage can definitely say has or has not a detrimental effect upon fish. One wonders whether the fertilisers we use may in the end have a bad effect upon life generally. Therefore, I counsel the Government to be most careful about what they propose in the Bill in this regard.<br><br>
Naturally, the whole subject of river purification is close to the hearts of us all. The problem is whether previous Measures, and this one now, will cure the trouble. The river which flows past our window here gives plain evidence that the City of London, with all the Measures put upon the Statute Book until now, has not found a cure. Some people say that this Bill does not go anywhere near as far as the Measures applying to English rivers, yet the law in England has not yet produced the fruits of success. It is the duty of any responsible
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
Government, and I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends are of that sort, to find ways to overcome the difficulties which have confronted our colleagues across the Border and to improve upon what they have done. If I may say so, with the greatest respect, I very much doubt that this Bill will bring success, and I urge the Government to look at the matter closely again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When, at our last Sitting, the majority of hon. Members welcomed the Bill, though some were more critical than others, almost all that needed to be said was said, but I have one or two questions to ask. My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) drew attention to the small amount of money provided under the Bill to be met by the purification boards, about £25,000, and I wonder whether we could be a little clearer in our minds about exactly what the Bill will cost local authorities in Scotland. I believe that it will be a serious burden.<br><br>
My county of Fife, for instance, put in a major river purification sewer for the River Leven, and although this has been completed only within the last few years, I gather that it is now already overloaded. Apparently, just as we have congestion on the roads in built-up areas, so we shall have congestion in the sewers of built-up industrial areas.<br><br>
We should acknowledge the good work which is done by many bodies in trying to meet their obligations. I have a particular case in mind, at Cupar, where the British Sugar Corporation has spent a great deal of money in putting in extra settling tanks in order to try to overcome the problem of the discharge it puts into the River Eden from its factory there. But this, again, calls to mind that, just as Fife County Council put in the River Leven sewer, it had a scheme for a River Eden purification sewer but it had to give it up because of the cost and go in for several smaller purification schemes. I hope, therefore, that we shall bear in mind what all this is to cost the ratepayers of Scotland so that we suggest something which is within the bounds of possibility.<br><br>
Now, the question of tidal waters. When he was explaining Clause 8(2), the Minister of State said that it would
<br><blockquote><p>"apply control over new or altered discharges to all those tidal waters."—[OFFICIAL REPORT,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 24th Nov., 1964; c. 12.]</p></blockquote>
as mentioned in the Third Schedule. I wonder whether it is necessary now to extend the provisions of the Bill to every estuary which has a major city upon it. On the east coast this would particularly affect Dundee and Aberdeen. At the beginning of this year, when there was concern in the River Tay purification board about the amount of pollution in the Tay, it was suggested that the provisions of the old Act should be extended to cover the estuary of the Tay, but the first consequence of that was that the council in Dundee voted against it because it knew that it would cost so much money to do so. As I understand it, under the Bill at least new and altered discharges into tidal waters will come under its jurisdiction, but I wonder whether, if we are to safeguard the River Tay, probably the most valuable fishing river in all Scotland, we should extend its provisions now to cover not only new and altered outlets but all outlets into the Tay.<br><br>
As regards coastal areas, are we satisfield that the old provisions which we have made for discharging neat sewage into the sea should continue for all time? Here I must declare an interest as I am part-owner of a sewer which discharges into the Forth. I had a little experience of the problem recently because I had to extend that sewer in order to meet the requirements of the local authority. This is an important matter because not only do we have the discharge of neat sewage into the sea but the River Leven trunk sewer discharges into Largo Bay. Although the sewage goes through some sort of mincing machine, in certain conditions of wind and tide the chopped-up refuse comes in on the tide and is discharged on the beaches of East Fife. As one comes into East Fife, one always notices that the atmosphere changes, the sun shines and the sands are always golden—it must be something to do with the political climate there—but, as a result of certain conditions, the refuse tends to be deposited on our beaches and, in the same way, we ourselves are discharging neat sewage into these tidal waters. Although there is reason to think that this is not something which we can do straight-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
away it is something which should be considered in the near future.<br><br>
If we solve this problem, we should be able to do what the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) has in mind, putting the compost which would arise back on the land instead of using some of the more dangerous fertilising methods. I can illustrate the danger of some fertilisers by an example taken from my own constituency. Last summer, a tanker which was delivering what is called in the river purification board's letter concentrated ammoniacal liquor, which, of course, was intended to be spread on the land in the right quantities, got stuck. As a result of the accident, the driver decided to discharge his load into the next field. It ran down the ditch and ultimately killed 2,000 fish. This example serves to show what danger there is if such materials are not used in the right proportions.<br><br>
I hope that we shall bear in mind the cost which will fall on the ratepayers of Scotland, the need to examine closely what particularly facilities we should have for controlling discharge into tidal waters from big cities, and the need to keep the beaches clean, in which, of course, oil pollution also is a large element. I hope that all these points will be considered carefully in Committee and that the Bill will be improved accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At our Sitting last Tuesday we paid compliments to my right hon. and hon. Friends who have come into office, but, at the risk of boring the Committee a little, I wish to preface what I have to say by congratulating my hon. Friend the Minister of State and adding a special word of compliment to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State whose task it will be to wind up. I take this opportunity now because there will be no such opportunity at the end of our proceedings. The Committee will be interested to recall that it was the late Mr. Hector McNeil who was the Member for Greenock when the 1951 Act was introduced. It is a happy coincidence that his successor as Member for Greenock is participating in presenting this amending Measure to the Committee. I congratulate my hon. Friend, and I hope that the people of Greenock will always be grateful for the earlier association which he had with Maryhill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
This Bill adds something to the 1951 Act, after an interval of 13 years, but the 1951 Act itself replaced, and was designed to improve the situation left by, the Act of 1876, 75 years earlier. In some recent reports of the Health Department comments are made on the operation of the 1951 Act. I notice that on page 33 of the Report of the Health Department for 1961 it is said:
<br><blockquote><p>"From 1st September"—</p></blockquote>
that is, 1961—
<br><blockquote><p>"Angus County Council, Kincardine County Council and Arbroath Town Council became River Purification Authorities … as the result of an order made by the Secretary of State. By this order the basins of the North and South Esk were brought within the scope of the Act, and all Scotland is now subject to its provisions."</p></blockquote>
That was after the Act had been in operation for ten years.<br><br>
Reading the latter part of that sentence, I wondered whether it was a <i>cri de coeur,</i> a cry of exhortation or a cry of execration, that, at long last, after ten years under the previous Administration, the Act was apparently now being fully observed. We know that many of our rivers are still badly polluted, and many of the complaints arise from the lack of energy and enthusiasm on the part of the previous Administration in ensuring that the boards were doing their work.<br><br>
I endorse what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). Those of us who were in Parliament when the 1951 Act was going through recall only too vividly all the doubts and fears expressed then by hon. Members opposite on behalf of the local authorities. They are being expressed again today. Apparently, these matters are the responsibility of everyone but those intimately concerned. We have had pleas for the farmers, for industry and for other exceptional classes, yet they have a contribution to make and must be seen to have it.<br><br>
From the <i>Evening News</i> last night I culled a most apposite quotation. This is a Scottish Bill, but what the <i>Evening News</i> had to say yesterday about the River Thames applies to what is happening north of the Border and serves to emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire. In its leading article the <i>Evening News</i> commented on the report of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
London County Council's scientific adviser on the river which flows outside our window. It pointed out that the report
<br><blockquote><p>"reveals that the condition of the River Thames, which we have so often been told is improving, in fact deteriorated last year … No fewer than 1,000 discharges of waste from trade premises, out of 4,000 examined, failed to conform to the standard required"</p></blockquote>
and went on to ask:
<br><blockquote><p>"What happened to the 1,000 offenders detected last year?"</p></blockquote>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
What about these reports? Apparently, they are not available. I have tried to obtain the reports of some of the boards in Scotland, and I am having the greatest difficulty. It was only at the last moment that I was provided with two. Some of the questions which I wish to ask my hon. Friend relate to the operation of the present Act. Is he satisfied that the Reports are being provided regularly? Is it true that there is a delay in respect of the one from the Solway Firth and from the one regarding the Clyde?<br><br>
If the work of the Department is not being carried out, no wonder there seems to be a lack of urgency over the whole matter. Those very authorities who, in 1951, were putting forward difficulties and, through their Parliamentary representatives, were fighting the continuation of the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, still want authority to be left to single local authorities. They were not willing to co-operate, which would be the ideal arrangement. Those local authorities responsible for the higher reaches and different stretches of the river should co-operate.<br><br>
Unless there is co-operation the whole business will fall down. In 1951 the majority of hon. Members on the Standing Committee assented to the recommendations of the Broun-Lindsay Committee which recommended that an <i>ad hoc</i> authority be set up to deal with this problem. One of my hon. Friends described that type of authority, which is backward-looking and stick-in-the-mud, as "reactionary". I think that is going too far. Some of these authorities could not be accused of any movement whatever, and to describe them as being in a state of suspended animation would be better.<br><br>
The Government, may expect the greatest support from the present Leader of the Opposition. At that time he was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
leading a crusade for the cleansing of our rivers. He went so far as to be very critical of local authorities. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The larger burghs, in many cases, have not only achieved delay"—</p></blockquote>
whatever that means—
<br><blockquote><p>"but—if I may so put it—have been actively indolent in this matter, resisting all the pressure anybody, including the county councils, could put upon them."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21st June, 1951; c. 2140.]</p></blockquote>
These are strong words from the present Leader of the Opposition, and this Government may be encouraged by the support which they will receive from hon. Members opposite in trying to persuade local authorities to do something.<br><br>
The noble Lord—I am sorry: the Leader of the Opposition—went further. He said that the people of the towns should be able to take their recreation besides pure waters and that was more than ever precious in these days. I am quite sure that all the miners and steel-workers going down in buses to take their recreation at the side of the River Tweed, as a result of this great crusade by the Leader of the Opposition, will understand the great fight which he has put up on their behalf.<br><br>
Now, after ten years of active indolence on the part of the previous Administration, the new Government have, within a month of taking office, introduced a Bill, but I think that they would be fair enough to admit that it is not their Bill, that it was bequeathed to them by the previous Administration. What I now propose to say may detract from the satisfaction which my previous remark may have occasioned.<br><br>
It was, so far as I can understand from the Reports, in 1961 when the Advisory Committee recommended to the previous Administration. That is, three years ago, and the recommendation was made only on the grounds that the English boards were already established and had made some recommendations. So this is more proof of the statement made by the Minister of State that we are trailing at the coattails of England in this matter.<br><br>
We welcome this Bill. Some of us have doubts, as were expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire, that it has not sufficient "teeth" to achieve the purpose which we desire. There have been delays in giving effect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
to Orders made under the 1951 Act. For example, there was a draft Order in respect of the tidal waters of the Solway. It was published in 1961. There were two objections to it and they were under consideration at the end of that year. A public inquiry was held in 1962. The report of that inquiry was under consideration in that year. The provisions of the Act were finally applied by Order in February, 1963. If that sort of thing happens, it does not reveal enthusiasm and energy for the application of the provisions of the Act. There was a similar Order in respect of the tidal waters of the Firth of Clyde published early in 1962. There were a number of objections, and an inquiry was held in 1963. According to the report, the result of that inquiry is still awaited. I should be interested to know whether my hon. Friend can tell us the reason for the interval of something like two years which occurred before these Orders were complied with.<br><br>
Experiments have been carried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research into processes for the removed of oil from beaches and from river banks. These have proved successful, but I think that the Committee would like to know from what sources the oil comes, and why it should be necessary to carry out these processes. We are all pleased that the experiments were successful, but we should be more pleased if the source of the pollution were traced and the pollution stopped.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) referred to radioactive substances. I should like my hon. Friend to confirm whether such substances may be dealt with by the provisions in this legislation or under the Radioactive Substances Act, 1960. There are some people who are anxious to be assured which legislation is involved.<br><br>
When we are discussing the estuaries of the Forth and the Clyde I wonder whether my hon. Friend will recall that there is another stretch of water which joins them, which also is a source of pollution and could be a menace to health? I cannot develop the point now, but there is a stretch of water 40 miles long joining the Forth and the Clyde. It is called the Canal. It is now out of use for navigation, but it is a source of pollution for these most important estuaries,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
and I should like my hon. Friend to provide some information on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every hon. Member who has taken part in this debate, and not least the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) has emphasised the importance of the subject. I am glad to say that in the area which I know best, namely, Galloway, the problem of pollution is nothing like so serious as in other areas which have been mentioned. We still have fish in all the rivers in Galloway.<br><br>
This question is undoubtedly very important for industry in Scotland and the position must be watched very carefully. The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) mentioned that the use of a new soap powder or detergent could alter an old discharge. Similarly, the use of chemicals for cleaning out dairy utensils or bulk tanks could affect the water into which the effluent is discharged. Although this is not my maiden speech, I should like to pay tribute to a former Member of Parliament for my constituency, Mr. Mackie, who produced a Bill from which the 1951 Act resulted. Some credit is due to him for the fact that the position is not so bad today as it might have been.<br><br>
There is no doubt that local authorities are having difficulty in applying the principles of legislation to prevent pollution. When an industry comes to a small burgh, often it is the case that employment will be provided for 40 or 50 people. The burgh authorities are delighted at this, and the last thing they want to discuss with the industrialist is what is to happen to the sewage and effluent from the factory. Very often they find, when it is too late, and if for example the new industry is a paper mill or a new creamery, that the effluent which results can block up the drains.<br><br>
It is, I think, possible under the Local Employment Act to obtain a 25 per cent. building grant which includes the provision of drainage, but it is usually found that the local authority is called upon to do the work and I do not think that such a grant is available to local authorities. I think that some examination of the position should be made. It may be tied up with the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act, 1944, and I think I am right in saying that a grant of almost 30 per cent. may be obtained
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
by local authorities and burghs to make better provision for their sewage.<br><br>
It is an interesting point and one which I consider important, affecting small burghs with a population of just over 3,000. Recently in my area in Castle Douglas and Dalbeattie, where the populations are about 100 and 300 in excess of 3,000, the installation of a new sewage purification plant in each case cost over £200,000. That is an absolutely crippling burden for such small burghs. They are unable to get any assistance under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act. There is nothing in the legislation saying that it should not apply to small burghs. I understand that in landward areas, if it is a question of a village coming under the county council with a larger population than 3,000, the grant may be obtained. In Scotland there is special difficulty from having so many small burghs with populations of about 3,000. I hope that the Minister will be able to look at this matter to see whether the anomaly may be swept away and assistance given to small burghs faced with a crippling burden of expenditure over the disposal of effluent.<br><br>
Disposal into streams and rivers may be more or less noxious depending on the type of discharge. In the Hill Watson Report the discharge from laundries is described as not particularly bad, as is the effluent from farms. The effluent from paper mills and coal mimes is considered to be particularly bad, and we have to take account of priorities in this matter, as well as the money available for putting things right. We must look carefully at the standard of discharge. The Scottish Office must rely considerably on the advice which it gets from the purification boards.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
A year or two ago a small village of 24 houses in my area was to be given a main drain by the county council. The effluent plant was designed by the county council engineers according to the most modern lines. I think I am right in saying that in a modern plant the effluent is pretty harmless. The Scottish Office completely refused to accept the scheme, although it had already been passed by the river purification board. What was completely incomprehensible was that further down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
two very large dairy farms were discharging completely neat farm sewage into the stream. We had many meetings on this matter. The final result was that, instead of the scheme costing £7,000, a very large scheme had to be put to the Scottish Office before it would pass it. From memory, the cost was £24,000. Special pumping arrangements were needed. There was a charge on revenue the whole time, and the cost of the scheme came out at much more than £1,000 a house. I must confess that the Scottish Office sweetened it by giving us a maximum grant under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act, but it seemed to me a great waste of money, particularly when it went against what the river purification board wanted to do.<br><br>
I suggest to the Under-Secretary of State and the Government that they should rely more on the purification board and the priorities which the board puts forward. If they did that the grants which they could give under the Rural Water Supplies Act would be very useful. I do not think there should be any waste of money which can be possibly avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Bence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I follow preceding speakers in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele) on taking the Chair at this Committee? I should also like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Dr. Dickson Mabon) and my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), who is not present, on taking office. I can assure hon. Members opposite, and the new Members on this side, that it will not be long before my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East adds some Naval colour to St. Andrew's House briefs, and, after a running-in period, will enliven the Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
On a Friday last summer the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) introduced a Bill on spray irrigation. It was well supported on our side, but, if I remember rightly, the hon. Gentleman was about the only Member opposite who was present.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to have his memory refreshed. I think that he was supported by only one or two of his hon. Friends, as was I on my side, but I think that we gave the Bill a very searching examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a great reputation in Opposition, which I doubt will be sustained in the next four years, for giving a searching examination to every Measure which was introduced.<br><br>
On that occasion it was pointed out by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn and my hon. Friends that spray irrigation could maintain very low levels of water in many rivers. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), on Tuesday, referred to effluent flowing into streams when the water level was low. These two Measures, taken together, will have to be very carefully examined when it comes to giving a licence for spray irrigation and giving consent for emitting effluent into a stream. We all know that when a river is in spate it can take effluent to a higher degree of impurification because it is carried away by the river; but if affluent is put in a river when it is not in spate the danger of pollution is much greater.<br><br>
One thing which strikes me about a Measure dealing with the purification of rivers is that there seems to be a multitude of difficulties why it cannot be done. If one goes to the industrial centre of Paris one can see animal and vegetable life in the river and men fishing. The great industrial city of Heidelberg is on a river, the River Neckar, which is not polluted. In Switzerland, the Rivers Arne and Rhine run through great industrial towns, but, nevertheless, there is trout in them. These rivers are not polluted, and never have been. I cannot accept that the purification of rivers is as difficult a task as some people would make out.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for West; Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) mentioned fertilisers. My experience is that pollution arises from sprays. The spraying of insecticides over crops, followed by heavy rain, often results in considerable pollution of rivers which often destroys oxygenating weeds. I have seen examples of this, not in Scotland, but in the south of England. In a stretch of river beds of oxygenating weeds have been destroyed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
by sprays and selective weed killers which have been sprayed over fields and then washed into the rivers. That is what the riparian owners say. There was a case in Hampshire many years ago when it was said that it was selective weed killers which had destroyed oxygenating weeds with the result that certain species of fish, such as grayling and trout, had declined.<br><br>
I understand that the terms "trade effluent" and "sewage" do not include pollution from selective weed killers and insecticides, but these are a very important source of river pollution. The draining of fields into rivers must carry with it some remains of insecticide spraying. This is a very important matter which should be examined by river purification boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. A. Stodart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Needless to say, I am very interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I wonder whether there is a solid foundation for his claim that the spraying of insecticides on the land results in river pollution, because I think that they are so concentrated that one sprays about two pints to an acre, which is about one drop to a square yard. I find it difficult to believe that even after rain rivers are polluted through this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has made that point. This was the excuse given in three cases about which I know. The industrialists argued that the pollution of the rivers was not their fault but that of the farmers using insecticides. The three cases to which I referred concern the Rivers Teme, at Tenbury, the Hampshire, Avon and the Severn.<br><br>
I have tried to ascertain whether there are any sugar beet factories in Scotland from which effluent is poured into the rivers. I do not believe that it is a polluting effluent or that it damages vegetable or animal life in the rivers, but it is a very unpleasant phenomenon. Any angler who has fished rivers into which sugar beet effluent has been poured knows what an unpleasant mess it makes in the rivers. Whether sugar beet effluent would be treated as a trade effluent I do not know. As I say, I tried to find out whether there are sugar beet plants in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a sugar beet factory in my constituency. When I spoke
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
I said that the British Sugar Corporation had spent considerable sums of money on putting in settling tanks to take the discharge. However, one of the troubles of settling tanks is that when they dry out they make a most objectionable smell. One needs to employ Mr. Chanel to deal with what happens afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member has a sugar beet factory in his constituency. The discharge of effluent from sugar beet factories is a very difficult problem. Whether anything can be done within the confines of the Bill to prevent the discharge of sugar beet effluent in the form in which I have seen it discharged, I do not know. It would be very desirable if something could be done about it.<br><br>
I have referred to the definition of trade or sewage effluent. I do not know whether it includes effluent from spraying. It was said many years ago that some damage had been done to oxygenating weeds in the River Tees. Whether this case was exaggerated by the industrialists concerned, I do not know, but the question whether spraying results in damage to oxygenating weeds is worthy of examination. I know of three cases in which the spraying of selective weed killers and insecticide had an effect on fly life and all sorts of animal life on the river bank. The hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Mr. Stodart) may think that this is gross exaggeration, but this is the case which the industrialists put up, and we must not let it go without examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member know of the experiment which went on in Loch Awe in 1948 when five tons of ammonia sulphate were put in the Loch with the result that fish life increased enormously? I think therefore that a case could be made out for increasing the oxygenating weed content of rivers by putting fertilisers in them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept that. I would not disagree with it. But it may not be true of vegetable fertilisers. I am an angler, not an expert on fertilisers. But this practice may in some measure be injurious. The hon. Gentleman has quoted a nitrogenous fertiliser which may be beneficial, but my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire was right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
in making the point that there may be some fertilisers which are injurious. I think that I am justified, too, in raising the point in that industrialists have contended that farmers, by spraying fields with selective weed killers, do damage to the balanced life in the river.<br><br>
It is time that we looked to our capacity to keep our rivers clean, because across the Channel, in France, Germany, and Switzerland—not so much in Italy—there are huge industrial cities on rivers which are full of animal life of all kinds. There is plenty of plant life, there is plenty of fish life—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must realise that this Bill does not apply to Switzerland.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it gives local authorities in Scotland power to apply certain principles, and it gives powers to certain bodies to keep rivers pure and to control effluent. Surely I am entitled to give examples of what happens in certain European cities which are not far away, and which can be visited by any hon. Member, where control has been exercised not for the last few years but for hundreds of years? If a real effort is made here I see no reason why every river should not be cleaned up, so that salmon and trout can run up it and we can bring back plant and animal life, as well as the weed life which is essential to maintain the fish population. I do not see any reason why we cannot do this if we make a serious effort. We are doing many highly scientific things in the world today and this is one thing we could do in our modern urbanised socities. Holidaying on our Scottish rivers is becoming increasingly a leisure pastime of our people. One of the finest things we could do for Scotland would be to clean up our estuaries and rivers to such a degree as to make them an added attraction to those people who like to spend their leisure by rivers and estuaries.<br><br>
We know that some of the pollution in our estuaries is worse than it is higher up the rivers. Estuary pollution is a very bad thing, because although a river like the Clyde may be clean in its upper reaches, if the estuary is polluted it prevents migratory fish from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
coming up. It seems to me to be folly to tolerate a polluted estuary when the river above it is clean and would be receptive to migratory fish wishing to spawn. Surely we can clean up our estuaries so that these migratory fish can come up our rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has become clear that although the majority of hon. Members welcome the Bill there is great disappointment that the 1951 Act has not been successful in eliminating pollution. This Bill will not greatly improve the situation. While the Minister of State was introducing the Bill his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) interrupted in order to ask which rivers had improved. The right hon. Gentleman said that little improvement had taken place in the rivers in his constituency; the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) said that the Clyde was still a national disgrace, and only just now the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) looked forward to the time when salmon would be able to go up all our rivers.<br><br>
If we set our aim as the complete purification of rivers and the abolition of pollution we are bound to be disapointed in the effect of the 1951 Act and in this Bill. If we set this as our aim we are simply kidding ourselves, because at present pollution is a problem which cannot reasonably be solved, in view of the legacy of the past and the needs of industry; but it is a problem which we can control, and if we view the Bill in terms of trying to control the problem and preventing further deterioration we should be able to welcome it and consider it as a reasonable step.<br><br>
The Bill has two main objectives. The first is to control the pre-1951 effluent and the second is to remove certain anomalies which have arisen out of the operation of the 1951 Act. In those circumstances I welcome the Bill, because I think that it will achieve these objectives, but the Bill has two principal weaknesses, which I hope can be resolved, and I am disappointed that the Government have not seen fit to try to resolve them.<br><br>
First, it is unfortunate that although the 1951 Act has been in operation for a long time the Bill makes no attempt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
to change the constitution of river purification boards. The only change made by the Bill in the functions of the boards will tend to reduce their effectiveness. As to the constitution of the boards, it is no new criticism to say that they are not the kind of bodies which can deal with these problems most effectively, because they are composed mainly—to the extent of two-thirds—of local authority representatives and representatives of agriculture, fishing and industry.<br><br>
When the 1951 Measure was being discussed I remember reading that the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said that we were doing something similar to appointing a company of butchers to promote vegetarianism. There is some truth in that, in that the membership of these boards tends to consist of people who are creating the problem of pollution. It is not entirely true, because some industry requires clean water, and if the rivers were cleaned up it would be helped. Similarly, certain local authorities, for health reasons, are also anxious to clean up rivers in some of our industrial areas. But, generally speaking, there is no question but that the interests of local authorities, industry and even agriculture are not in favour of promoting cleaner rivers and indulging in massive expenditure to bring it about.<br><br>
The real difficulty is that the boards have complete discretion to consider each problem on its merits and to fix byelaws and set standards. It is unfortunate that the only specific obligation now resting on river boards is removed by Clause 4(2), which provides that the provision for prescribing byelaws shall cease to have effect. That means that purification boards will have complete discretion to consider each case on its merits and to take whatever action it thinks appropriate in the general direction of the Bill.<br><br>
What kind of problems will the boards have to consider? They may have to consider taking action against certain industries which are polluting the rivers. We know that almost every major Scottish local authority is now doing all it can to attract new industry and to encourage existing industry to grow. In those circumstances, is it fair to expect a body composed of two-thirds of local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
authority representatives to do what it can to purify a river if, in the process, it may close down certain industries or make them completely uneconomic?<br><br>
The second problem—and it is a major problem for the boards—is the question of obnoxious industries. Near my constituency there is a leather works which is responsible for a great deal of pollution, and there is also a chrome and chemical works. These specialised industries employ large numbers of skilled people. Those skills have been accumulated, and cannot be transferred to other industries, and it is unreasonable to expect a body composed mainly of local authority representatives to take steps which might cause those industries to close down or to be scared away to other areas.<br><br>
The third problem concerns our basic heavy industries. We have had several references to the paper industry. When the 1951 Measure was being discussed it was suggested that 350 tons of water were required to process one ton of paper. In the case of industries like this, on which the whole of a local economy may depend, it is unreasonable to expect a board which has complete discretion and scope to do so to take the action which is required when that action will have a bad effect on local industry.<br><br>
There are two things which might help to solve the problem. First, we could change the constitution of the boards by putting more specialists and independent people on them. But this would really be unreasonable, because the people who should be in control are those who have the job of putting into effect the recommendations of the boards. The only thing that we could do which might be fairer to the boards in the matter of exercising their powers would be to lay down more specific tasks and more definite responsibilities. If the onus of making decisions and setting standards were taken away from the boards and were laid down by the Government or by the Bill, we should create a more reasonable situation in which the boards could exercise their functions.<br><br>
The second thing which has disappointed me is the fact that no attempt has been made to adjust the functions of the boards. Not long ago we passed the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
I thought that some attempt would have been made to broaden the functions of the boards so that they would have responsibility for dealing with many of the problems which exist on our rivers.<br><br>
There are three main problems relating to every river. First, there is the problem of flooding and flood prevention; secondly, there is the problem of pollution, and, thirdly, the problem of the contamination of the banks. How are we trying to cope with the problem of flooding? Under the 1961 Act we are dealing with it in the same way as we used to deal with river pollution, each local authority accepting responsibility for its own area. It has been very rare for a joint scheme to be put forward by several local authorities, and when such schemes have been put forward they have usually not got off the ground.<br><br>
I can give one or two examples. In my constituency we have a serious flood problem with the river Cart. A proposal is now in the Scottish Office, awaiting approval, so that we can go forward with a scheme which will cost £250,000 to prevent flooding in my constituency. But we know full well that if the scheme goes through—and it will probably cure the problem in our area—the problem will simply be transferred either up or down the river. That is usually the case with a problem of this nature. I believe that the only way in which the problem can properly be solved is by dealing with the problem of flooding in the same way as we deal with pollution, by introducing schemes covering a whole river basin.<br><br>
Another example exists in the case of the Muirend Burn, in my constituency. A joint scheme has been proposed and put forward to deal with a serious problem involving pollution and the danger to health by flooding. Because two authorities were involved, however, it was two years before we could reach a decision, and when that decision was reached the whole scheme was dropped because the riparian proprietors living beside the Muirend Burn were not prepared to make an adequate financial contribution. As a result, nothing has been done.<br><br>
The third problem—of the river banks—demands immediate attention. In many cases it is not clearly established who is responsible for cleaning up river banks.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
On two occasions I have managed to persuade corporation departments to take action. On one occasion the city engineers' department cleaned up a stretch of river which was in a disgraceful state, but it said that it did not regard this work as its responsibility and would not do it on another occasion. At another time the cleansing department cleaned up a section of the river bank, but once again said that it was not its responsibility. Responsibility in this matter is not clear. This is another matter which should be added to the responsibilities of river authorities who accept responsibility for pollution and flooding.<br><br>
My third and final objection to the Bill is that additional cost will be involved for local authorities. One principle which has been generally accepted in Committee, and in local government circles, is that if we are going to place additional responsibilities on local authorities the Government should make an additional financial contribution. Although hon. Members on both sides of the Committee may have different views as to how much assistance should be given, and as to what percentage of all additions should be made in the way of a general grant for specific additional functions, it is clear that if we give local authorities more functions and more responsibilities there should be a financial contribution from the centre.<br><br>
This is a serious problem for local authorities, because many of them, particularly Glasgow, are spending large sums of money in sewage purification involving expensive capital works in respect of which there is a contribution from the Government. These responsibilities will increase, and the Government must therefore make some estimate of the expenditure they envisage and then make a real contribution towards local authorities who are having a hard time. We are putting local authorities in the position of making it more expensive for industry to carry on its operations, and we have only recently added a burden in the form of the 7 per cent. Bank rate. Additional burdens are being placed on local authorities all the time, and at this stage it is essential not to increase their problems or to add unnecessarily to their burdens.<br><br>
Apart from this, if we consider the Bill not as a means of trying to solve
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
the problem but as a means of controlling it, we should welcome the Bill and give it our full support.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to take up too much of the Committee's time. I warmly welcome any proposals which will tend to render purer our rivers as well as our air, because I believe that the abolition of the pollution of the atmosphere and of rivers is a very important contribution which we can make to our society.<br><br>
I have listened to what has been said with much interest. I want to make a point which I do not think was made until the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) spoke. I want to try to widen the scope of the debate and bring in river banks as well as rivers. When one speaks about rivers, one thinks naturally of beautiful country rivers and streams. We must also consider carefully some of our very large industrial rivers. I am referring in particular to the River Clyde, with perhaps a reference to the River Kelvin.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) I have had some experience at looking at European rivers. I know in France the Seine, the Oise, the Loire, the Rhone, the Somme—all the large rivers. The French know that if they go on a summer evening for a walk on the banks of those rivers there are cafés and facilities on the banks which they can enjoy. I make a plea for some attempt to solve the Esthetic problem which we encounter on our river banks. I do not think that the purpose of the Bill will have been fully achieved if rivers are rid of noxious effluent but there are not facilities for people to use river banks for purposes which are enjoyable in their leisure.<br><br>
Section 9 of the 1951 Act makes this provision:
<br><blockquote><p>"A river purification board may acquire by agreement any land which they require for any purpose connected with the exercise of their functions."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that river banks come into this category. I was born in the Langside district of Glasgow, which is in the Cathcart constituency. The River Cart flows through the constituency. I remember being very attracted to the river as a boy. We used to play on its banks. I think most people are attracted to rivers. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
may be part of the death wish. That I do not know. I make this plea because I think that psychologically it is not only essential that the water itself should be purified as far as possible so that the life in the river should be maintained; I believe also that from the point of view of people it is absolutely essential that river banks should be clean and made places of pleasure to those who use them.<br><br>
Anyone who has been in our very great city of Glosgow will be appalled—I use the word advisedly—not only by the state of the river itself but by the state of its banks as the river flows through the city. The banks are in an appalling state, with broken railings, with to a great extent, at any rate, overgrown fungi of different descriptions, with no facilities and with no attraction for people who go on a warm summer evening to stroll along the banks of the Clyde.<br><br>
I look forward to the day when, if we can extend the provisions of the Bill a little further, as well as having solved the problems of the pollution of the water we shall have solved the problems of the pollution of river banks. Then people will be able to do what I think is their right in a city such as Glasgow, namely, enjoy the facilities of river banks. Then it will be a real pleasure to enjoy the facilities in good weather, which sometimes comes to Glasgow and to other cities. When that day comes, powers will have been used to bring to a proper standard river banks as well as rivers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first add my congratulations to those which have been already voiced to the Minister of State upon his appointment? I also add my congratulations to the Under-Secretary, who, I understand, will wind up. I congratulate, too, the three maiden speakers in this Committee who have taken part in this debate. My hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) gave us the benefit of his knowledge of farming and of the special problems of purification. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Dr. Miller) spoke from a different point of view, particularly with their knowledge of industrial and built-up areas. All three hon. Members spoke fluently and lucidly, as we hope the rivers

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
of Scotland will flow in the future. They also showed a quality which I know is very much appreciated in this Committee: they were all concise and to the point.<br><br>
My noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) spoke about water resources and particularly about abstraction. He spoke with knowledge and experience from the post which he told us he held in the past. I would draw his attention to the fact that at the end of the last Parliament we discussed and then enacted the Spray Irrigation (Scotland) Bill. This was an important step in the question of the prevention of pollution, because one of the important aspects of that problem and the Bill introduced to meet it was that it was necessary that polluting substances be diluted sufficiently to neutralise them. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) said that the Bill should have come earlier. We realised that the other Bill was the urgent one to deal with pollution in Scotland because of the increasing amount of spray irrigation which was being undertaken. It was with some difficulty that we managed to fit it into the programme in the last Session, with the result that we had to take the Committee on the Floor of the House and go very late one night. Abstraction had become a priority in the matter of pollution. If we could have introduced the Bill, if there had been any possibility of getting it through in the last Session, we should not have held it back.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) mentioned the question of estuaries and tidal waters, which is dealt with in Clause 8. I thank the Minister of State for having provided some maps in response to the request. I understand that copies are available. They show us where the tidal waters lie. We do not expect something very accurately drawn as a chart, but this is valuable assistance to us.<br><br>
In the Second Schedule to the 1951 Act the Clyde and the Forth were particularly pointed to. My understanding is that the Sol way project was also brought in under Section 29(2) of that Act. Could the Under-Secretary tell us whether there were any other tidal waters which up to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
date have been brought in under Section 29, or can he confirm that there are no others?<br><br>
My right hon. Friend pointed out that under the 1951 Act and Clause 8 of the Bill there appear to be two stages in dealing with tidal waters. Under the Bill the intention is to bring the new tidal waters mentioned in the Schedule and shown on the map in the first stage—that is, to deal with them as regards new or altered discharges. We should like to have an explanation of the reasons for taking it in stages. We on this side would hope that the subsequent stage would not be too long delayed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) said, it is important that we should keep our coasts clean, and go ahead with this, though I realise, for reasons about which we shall no doubt hear, that it may be necessary to do this in stages. It is proposed now to carry out the second stage of the areas scheduled under the 1951 Act.<br><br>
We agree with the point made by the Minister of State that vessels be included in Scottish legislation. We understand from his speech that they are not included in English legislation. My experience has been that many of the complaints which one has heard about or received have been based upon suspicion that ships have produced the discharges complained about.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
In general, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have approved of the purification principle which is the basis of the Bill. Some have expressed doubts about whether the Bill goes far enough in trying to achieve a further step in this direction or whether it will be carried out. At least one hon. Member expressed doubts about that. On the other hand, other speakers have pointed to the problems for industries and for local authorities. Particular problems may arise, and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) drew attention to some of them. We intend to examine the Bill very closely in Committee in the light of all the possibilities. We shall aim for the maximum of purification while taking account of legitimate interests which may be affected and also of the importance, stressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis), of not putting

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
impediments in the way of industrial development in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Steele, I join with all hon. Members who have spoken—and with those who have not spoken but who, I know, feel the same—in welcoming you as Chairman of the Committee. I hope that you will be with us for a long time. It is good for us all to know that we have a friend in the Chair.<br><br>
I join in the congratulations to hon. Members who have spoken for the first time in here today. They will, I hope, enjoy their time in the Scottish Grand Committee and I must say that they have set a very good example in the succinct way in which they put their points today. Finally, I congratulate English Members who have been given the great pleasure and honour of joining the Scottish Grand Committee. I am sure that they will discover how thoroughly—I think that that is the best word I can use—we ventilate all the problems of Scotland in the matters which come before us.<br><br>
It has been a long and interesting debate. When I first took up my present office, naturally, I had to look at all the portfolios which it was my lot to consider, and I confess that this one did not strike me as being the most immediate. However, having gone into the matter, I hope, reasonably thoroughly, I regard it now as, perhaps, one of the most important prospects before the Scottish people that we should consider not only the problems of water but the problems of sewerage with a view to bringing about one of the most important social developments we could undertake in this century.<br><br>
Among the general broad criticisms of the Bill, of which there have been a few, there was the important matter raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), when he suggested that we could have taken a more radical solution to the whole problem. Of course, this should have been done thirty or forty years ago, perhaps even in the last century. We can only accept the situation as it is and start from there, not saying what we wish things might have been fifty years earlier. When the hon. Gentleman puts the case for a radical solution—I am always frightened by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
thought of radical solutions propounded by right wing Members; they remind one of Senator Goldwater sometimes—he cannot overlook that such a radical solution, if we were to apply it, or if he could have persuaded his own Government to apply it, would entail enormous cost. When one reflects how prudent in financial affairs the hon. Member for Hillhead is, and was as a Minister, it strikes one as incredible that he should make such a suggestion today. It is almost as prodigal a suggestion as might come from a drunken sailor on "demob" leave with his gratuity to spend. If one reckons the sum involved in terms of the cost of all the trunk line sewers, as he suggested, it is at once seen to be quite prohibitive for our country to face.<br><br>
If we accept the situation as it is and proceed from there the Bill deserves to be commended. I agree that the progress achieved so far is disappointing, and there are three main reasons for this disappointment. First, there has not been the development by local authorities of the sewage purification works which are necessary if we are to make a real contribution to the removal of pollution from our rivers. Many reasons have been advanced for this lack of development. Some people say that the local authorities have not been producing the schemes. I gather that comment of this kind might have been made by hon. Members opposite a few years ago when they were in power. On the other hand, as the local authorities have retorted, it was the curtailment of many of their plans which resulted in the failure to develop the necessary sewage purification works. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has only just received the first Report of the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee on the subject of sewage disposal. He is considering it as a matter of urgency, but I regret that I am in no position to make a statement about it now.<br><br>
The second reason which could possibly be advanced for our disappointment is the very leisurely pace with which, apparently, river purification boards have been established. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) asked for some information about this, and it is relevant to the case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
in support of the Bill. This criticism of method, of course, is not necessarily a criticism of principle. Nevertheless, let us look for a moment at the results of past methods. It took three years to establish the Tweed River Purification Board, the Solway River Purification Board, the Ayrshire, the Lothians, and the Banff, Moray and Nairn River Purification Boards. It took four years to establish the Forth River Purification Board, five to establish the Clyde River Purification Board, six to establish the Dee and Don River Purification Board and nine to establish the Tay River Purification Board. There may have been good reasons for this leisurely progress, but those are the facts, and it seems to some people that, under the stewardship of right hon. and hon. Members opposite, things may well not have gone as speedily as one would wish.<br><br>
Not only that, but the actual work of the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee was to a large extent dependent on the formation of these boards, and that Committee itself could not get into action and make itself felt properly until it had the information coming to it from the various river purification boards. Therefore, if there is disappointment, that is the second reason for it.<br><br>
The third reason is the failure of the last Government to implement the Hill Watson Report. It is interesting to reflect that the Hill Watson Committee on the Drainage of Trade Premises was set up in the years of the Labour Government. It reported in April, 1954, and its recommendations have lain dormant ever since. Hon. Members opposite have taken credit, so they say, for initiating or helping to initiate the scheme established under the 1951 Act. I do not see how that is so. It is true that a Private Member's Bill was introduced, but the original Broun-Lindsay Report was published in January, 1951, and the Bill sponsored by the Labour Government, now the principal Act, was actually given its First Reading in March, 1951, a pretty good record even by the standards of these days of dynamic Wilsonian Government.<br><br>
The principal Act having been introduced by the Labour Government, it is not unreasonable to say that, if the previous Administration in their thirteen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
years had managed to bring forward the recommendations of the Hill Watson Committee in legislation, we might have been further forward and the 1951 Act would not have occasioned the kind of disappointment which has been expressed on both sides of this Committee.<br><br>
I say this in no partisan spirit. I am only trying to put the facts on record, for the Hill Watson Report is fundamental to our consideration of this whole matter. Its principal recommendations have a material bearing on the whole question of trade effluent and river pollution in as much as owners and occupiers of trade premises at present do not have a general right to connect their drains to the public sewers and thus are not able to dispose of their discharges by this means.<br><br>
The first recommendation of the Hill Watson Committee was that the local authorities should have the right to refuse to accept certain substances, to lay down conditions about the quantity and quality of the discharges, and to make charges for their service where appropriate. The second main recommendation was that owners of trade premises should be able, within the above limits, to make discharges into the sewers as of right.<br><br>
The first problem presented to the new Administration, who are sponsoring the Bill today, was whether or not we should incorporate in the Bill the conclusions of the Hill Watson Committee. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) asked that we should do this. As we see it, there are two arguments against it. First, no steps were taken by the previous Administration to include them as part of the Bill, and if we were to take time to do so, there would be delay. As hon. and right hon. Members know, once one begins to delay at this time in Parliamentary Session it is quite conceivable that the whole Bill will be lost in the present Session. We regard it as a very fair point that we should proceed with the Bill as it stands rather than delay it further to include a section incorporating Hill Watson. This is the first argument for refusing to accept Hill Watson at this stage.<br><br>
The second argument is that our sewerage code is hopelessly out of date. It must have been in the latter years of the last century that the essential parts operative today were finally agreed. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
is quite right that a modernising Government such as we are should wish to get on with a new codification as quickly as possible, but, if we are to settle a fresh sewerage code, as we intend to do, we consider that this should be undertaken in conjunction with provisions following on the Hill Watson Report. This is the second argument for delaying Hill Watson till such time as the new codification of sewerage practice can be completed.<br><br>
I am empowered by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to tell the Committee that it is his intention to introduce a Bill implementing the Hill Watson Report and covering the revision of the sewerage code in this Parliament, and, all going well, we hope, in the next Session.<br><br>
I turn now to the important points raised by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) about tidal waters. There are only two tidal waters, the Forth and Solway, covered by tidal waters Orders under the principal Act. There are applications outstanding, I am told, for Moray and Nairn, the Dee and Don, the Tweed, and Banff. Also, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) reminded us, there is to be the report following a public inquiry on the Clyde. I shall say a word about that later because it is a little more complicated now.<br><br>
As the Committee appreciates, these orders apply only to new or altered discharges, but, if we pass the Bill as it stands, old discharges, that is, discharges before the principal Act to waters covered by Orders, will automatically come under tthe system of control and aproval by the river purification boards.<br><br>
The question has been asked—I confess that it is one of the first points I raised when I studied the Bill and the submissions put to me—why not do the whole thing in one? We propose to take in under the Bill all the new and altered discharges to all the tidal waters on the maps which the Scottish Office has supplied—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentions maps. Could we see one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have a large supply of maps. You will recall, Mr. Steele, that this was mentioned at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
beginning of the last Sitting, and the officials managed to produce one in six minutes flat, which I thought a very good effort. They have produced a supply of maps this morning, which is even better.<br><br>
Hon. Members will see that there are 34 areas so designated. Under the Bill, if it is passed, new and altered discharges will be covered by the purification proceedure in all those marked areas. Existing discharges will require a tidal waters order, which is initiated by the river purification board or the river purification authority coming to the Secretary of State and asking for permission. If necessary, a public inquiry is held into objections, and ultimately the decision is made whether to issue an order or not.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
The argument has been put forward by the right hon. Gentleman in a very modest and moderate way. He realises that there are probably good reasons why we adopted this course rather than one of blanket control. We feel that industry would immediately grumble, despite the fact that a lot of warning has been given—as the Committee was reminded by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith)—that it was being asked to meet an enormous problem before it had time to look at its investment programme, and that a new cost was being added. This point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) and I hope to return to it.<br><br>
There are tidal waters, as will be made apparent from a moment's examination of the map, where there are no concentrations of heavy industry and no problem of pollution. It would seem superfluous to have a blanket control over all these waters. In the case of the Forth and Solway there are Orders existing now. If the Bill is passed old discharges will automatically come under the purification procedure.<br><br>
There is a problem regarding the Clyde. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill rightly complained that the public inquiry took a long time to come to a conclusion. There are reasons for that. It took some time to make representations. The previous Secretary of State was on the brink, or on the verge, of confirming a draft Order. We feel that at this stage it would be unfair to publish such an Order and then, because of the passage of this legislation.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
automatically have its provisions applied to the whole of Clydeside in relation not only to new and altered discharges but to old discharges. This would prove too great a shock for industry on Clydeside to take all at once. Therefore some thought is being given to what ought to be done regarding promoting an Order for Clydeside.<br><br>
These last comments relate to the kernel of the Bill and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) for reminding the Committee of this. It is all very well to proclaim the desirable ends which we seek, and the importance which we attach to clean, sparkling rivers and estuaries where the beauties of nature may be enjoyed. That is a very commendable goal. But one must realise that there must be a practical balance. For Scotland, industry is an essential feature of present day demands. It would be wrong to place obstacles in the way of new industry coming to Scotland, or prevent established industries from prospering. Therefore a right balance must be struck between the needs of industry and public needs in the form of amenities.<br><br>
That is also true of local authorities. They must strike a balance between the needs of their investment programmes, not only in connection with sewage disposal but in respect of housing and in other spheres of social need. I make no apology for championing the idea in the principal Act, which is sustained by this Bill, that the river purification boards and authorities ought to be made up of local authorities, industrial interests, agricultural interests, the general public and the fishing interests. These five interests ought to be represented. They have a legitimate balance of interest to maintain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend bear in mind in connection with "large burghs" mentioned in the principal Act, that some of the new towns already mentioned are growing into large burghs, and will he consider them when making appointments to local boards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that the bringing together of various local authority interests is difficult and it is difficult to balance the interests one against another. I take the point raised by my hon. Friend and we shall keep it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
much in mind, but it is not an easy problem to refer—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way to me. I agree with much of what he says. May I ask whether he would agree that there are certain dangers which would arise from recruiting interests which have a stake in matters with which the Bill is concerned? Does not he think that we should have more angling interests represented on the river boards? I was responsible for getting one representative, but I think that he should consider the possibility of there being at least two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite his influence with me, I can give my hon. Friend no promise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is usual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not fair. My hon. Friend has anticipated the very favourable remarks about angling which I shall be making later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah, that is good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying to the Committee, I do not think that any apology should be offered for the fact that, so to speak, we are taking the vested interests in this matter on to the purification authorities. We seek the co-operation of those concerned.<br><br>
No one has denied the end which the Bill is designed to achieve. Industry does not deny it, despite the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead about nationalised industries and comments which have come from private industry. Industry in this country has a social conscience, as any other section of the community. Some sections of industry can do more than others because they have been assisted by scientific and technical progress. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire in relation to paper mills. Industry and local authorities which are the principal offenders—if hon. Members care to put it that way—realise that the ends designed to be achieved by the principal Act are just. Therefore it is a question of getting the co-operation of those concerned.<br><br>
Some hon. Members have suggested that sewage effluent is a principal particular offender, but it depends on what is meant by "principal particular
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
offender". The hon. Member for Hill-head said that the quantities discharged were important. Sometimes they are, but often the quality of the noxiousness of the discharge, although the amount may be small, is far more important than a large discharge of sewage or industrial effluent, and that is a point which must be borne in mind. If one questions the experts about whether sewage or industrial effluent is the greater offender, the answer is that industrial effluent is.<br><br>
Therefore though it is right and proper that the Government should encourage local authorities to develop sewage purification schemes, it is also right that they should urge on industry, the need to bring industrial discharges into line with what is publicly desirable. The Government do not control the individual investment programmes of firms and the only way in which Government influence may be brought to bear is through the river purification authorities and boards.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) complained about the lack of adequate powers for the boards and authorities, and argued that this was indicated because there were few prosecutions, which implied little resolution on the part of boards to use their penal powers against offenders. That argument may be turned either way. It could be said that there are few prosecutions because there are few offenders, or because the boards are reluctant to use their powers. It is difficult to assess the position, but I think it a fair comment that there should be some kind of pacemaker or standardiser, not detailed regulations, regarding quantities and quality, and also in relation to the speed at which the boards are working. There should be some person or agency to make sure that the boards apply themselves to the very different problems which may exist in different areas of the country.<br><br>
We think that the answer lies in the Scottish River Pollution Advisory Committee. I can assure the Committee from personal experience that this is a powerful and competent body which takes itself very seriously and works conscientiously. It has had one or two rough things to say in its reports from time to time, as my right hon. Friend knows from personal experience and so, I understand, does the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). I am glad that this is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
Committee of spirit. It allows me to assure this Committee that here we have a public body anxious to make quite sure that the work is done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hannan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean, regarding the standards about which my hon. Friend has been speaking, that there must be some measurement of action or inaction? Will that rest with the Advisory Committee and not be applied by the provisions of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be able to elucidate this matter more clearly in the Committee on the Bill.<br><br>
I was asked whether there was some kind of standardiser or pacemaker for all the boards. Apart from the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office there is the Advisory Committee which is able to advise the Secretary of State and is enjoined in wide terms from the principal Act. This is somethting which is not reflected in the English legislation. The Committee has proved itself and works very hard. When we talk about measures and standards, we do not necessarily mean Scottish standards, but standards which are reasonable in the context of a particular problem. There may be industries small or large which are unable to do other than emit noxious effluent, or pack up business. It is an empirical way to approach the matter, but there has to be some kind of discipline—perhaps "discipline" is too strong a word—some kind of supervisory committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rankin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Discipline" is quite good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will find himself in the Whips' Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I have to be so diffuse in my remarks but it is difficult to cover all the points which have been raised. I apologise if I have failed to refer to one or two. I have no doubt that during the Committee discussions they will be raised again, and we shall be able to comment on them to see whether we can improve the Bill.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) the hon. Member for Hillhead and my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley referred to the National Coal Board. It is true that in one or two instances discharges
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
from National Coal Board pits and installations have been, to say the least, regrettable. It must also be recorded that on a number of occasions the Coal Board has worked constructively to improve the standard of effluent for which it is responsible. I would direct the attention of the Committee to the Report of the Solway Board showing the work which has been done there. It will be the task of the Advisory Committee and the Secretary of State to ensure that nationalised as well private industry should try to meet their social obligations.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
On the question of Dounreay and the other stations which involve the disposal of radioactive wastes, as I confirmed earlier in nodding my head to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill, this matter is covered by the Radioactive Substances Act, 1960. It is subject to very special procedures because of the extraordinarily dangerous nature of the waste.<br><br>
I think that this is a fair point to make about helping industry. Many industries, faced perhaps with river purification board inquiries, may wonder whether they will be up against people who will be difficult and awkward and who will merely lay down the law and not help them. This is quite untrue. Many river purification boards attempt to give a service of their own. Also the facilities of the Water Pollution Research Laboratory are available in showing industry how it can dispose of many of these wastes and, at the same time, deal with the problem of pollution. In one case which I inquired into I heard that the industry, by taking advice and setting up an admittedly expensive plant for the conversion of waste, was able to make its waste profitable and, in time, to pay for the original installation of the conversion plant. I do not suggest that that is possible in all industries, but it is worth while industrialists taking advice on this matter. It is a fair comment to make that industry has not taken advantage of the facilities of the Water Pollution Research Laboratory as it should. Having said that publicly, I hope that industry will respond to the invitation and seek the advice of the purification boards to try to convert their wastes.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
Agriculture is well represented on the benches opposite. Certainly the contributions of hon. Members opposite are welcomed by the Government because they give us an opportunity to comment. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked about the cost of an effluent treatment plant and how farmers might be helped in installing one to deal with their problems. Grants are available, mainly under the Farm Improvement Scheme, towards the cost of certain items of fixed equipment. I should be surprised if grants were not available under some scheme to help farmers with their various problems. I am glad to confirm that they are available in this case.<br><br>
On the question of technical assistance to farmers, the boards and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries arc most willing to advise farmers, but there is no doubt that farmers, particularly small farmers, have some problems in trying to meet all of the requirements of the Act. We are most anxious to help and that farmers should be given every assistance to meet the Act's requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the fanners get this service free?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As taxpayers, they are entitled to get advice free from the Department or board concerned. Other members of the public, if involved, can also get advice free from the boards. If the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West is concerned about his septic tank, he, too, can go to the boards, but not to the Department of Agriculture, to ask for advice, and he will get it free. There are some things which are free under this Government.<br><br>
I was asked about the questions of special financial help for farmers. I almost anticipated that this would be raised. I have made thorough inquiries and I am assured that we do not intend to afford any extraordinary or special kind of financial help to them. If we did, we should have to extend it to industry and local authorities, and that would be very expensive. We do not propose to make special grants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is coming to the point which I raised. He is talking

about the expense. I asked him whether he had any estimate of the expense, either in categories or in total. If he has, will he give it to the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to deal with that towards the end of my speech. If the right hon. Gentleman does not mind I should like to finish this part of what I am saying and then I will willingly turn to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could see that the pages of the hon. Gentleman's brief were getting fewer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was rather pleased, too!<br><br>
Turning to fisheries—because my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) is still breathing down my neck—it is right that angling clubs should be among those most anxious to improve the standards of river purification. The extraordinary thing is that the angling clubs are not as prolific in their complaints as one would imagine. This is most surprising, considering the many strong efforts which have been made by the protagonists of anglers to bring this matter to the public's attention. Having pulled down these pillars of argument, I do not want to bring the temple about my head by having anglers complaining even more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Manuel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do that to the boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am told—and I can only be guided by my advisers—that the number of complaints is smaller than expected and that the feeling is that efforts are being made, as far as possible, to meet the real complaints of anglers. We shall give every consideration to the point made by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
On the question of the loss of fish, one of the problems, following the complaints, is that it is very difficult often to say scientifically why fish have disappeared from the rivers. It is even more difficult to say to what cause the disappearance of the fish is due, because unless one can trace the specific cause it is extraordinarily difficult, except by taking overall measures, to get at the offender. This is a matter of serious and concerted research at the moment. I am told that the boards will have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
access to whatever findings become available from time to time to help them in their work of tracing offenders and trying to meet the genuine complaints of anglers. We have brought the penal Clause up to date in money terms, which I hope proves the Government's anxiety, irrespective of the small number of prosecutions in the past, to keep the penal powers in reserve.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North referred to the matter of water supply. He gave as an instance the Thames being used three or four times in its journey to the sea. We are fortunate in Scotland in that we have no pressing physical problem concerning water resources. No doubt this is a matter which will concern the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, which is bound to exercise the various interests in the Scottish Office. Certainly it is a matter which we shall keep very closely under review, but it is not one which we feel worthy of attention in this limited legislation.<br><br>
There seems to be some misunderstanding on the part of a number of hon. Members about cost. The small cost is concerned only with administering the prevention scheme either in the Scottish Office—and the estimate given is £1,000—or in the river boards—and the best estimate we can make is £25,000. It is not a cost in relation to the works carried out, because the works are carried out either by local authorities, in relation to investment in sewerage plant, or by industries, in relation to investment in industry, in the change of disposals, and in agriculture. Therefore, this small cost, as it would appear, is the cost of the bureaucracy—which might be the phrase used by the Opposition in a more violent moment—to deal with the matter.<br><br>
If we were to adopt the sweeping suggestion of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart that we could have adopted these three propositions in one, with which in earlier times I could probably have agreed, it would bring catcalls from our critics to the effect that it meant setting up a vast State bureaucracy with a sum needed to supervise it far in excess of the £25,000 which we are suggesting in the Bill. That is not a criticism; it is simply a point which I make in relation to expenses.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that the figure of £25,000 in the Bill is realistic, as I assume that it was arrived at before the Government took certain action which will increase the cost of administration? I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be aware that transport costs will count fairly highly among the river inspectors because the 6d. extra on petrol will naturally put up this figure. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will give us a new estimate in due course taking into account those other costs which are bound to go up as a result of the Government's policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will not want to go into detail on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Steele, for anticipating my feelings. However, this is a valid point which we should consider. The marginal extra cost, which must amount to a few shillings, of the travelling expenses of the inspectors because of the additional 6d. on petrol tax is covered by the efficient and improved administration which we have as a result of the Labour Party coming to office. We shall administer things more efficiently and less expensively, and we hope that we shall not have to spend the whole £25,000. This is not an unreasonable point to make, because naturally, having inherited the Bill in this form, we have had to go with a fine toothcomb into the estimates made under the previous Administration. We are satisfied that this figure is the most reasonable and up-to-date estimate that we can make.<br><br>
I have spoken about the interests of local authorities, industrialists, farmers, anglers and fishermen. I think it reasonable to conclude by pointing out the amenity interest. Too often is it thought that because local authorities are represented on the boards the public should not make its objections and protests directly to the boards. This is not true. I hope that the public will be willing to complain about river pollution, irrespective of who their local councillors are or whether they are on the river purification boards. Only the volume of public feeling which comes to the notice of the boards will make them feel anxious to insist that industry and agriculture should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
play their part with the local authorities in trying to clean up our rivers.<br><br>
I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has now joined us today to support the introduction of the Bill. I am very pleased to be supported also by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. This is the first Government Bill for which I have been responsible, and I am very proud of the early association to which my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill was kind enough to refer concerning my predecessor. We as an Administration, drawn mainly from urban areas, have always been anxious to help the countryside. We are delighted that our first Bill in the Scottish Grand Committee should be thus directed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked the hon. Gentleman, not specifically about the £25,000, which may or may not be enough for the nine river boards in the extra tidal areas, but whether he could give some guide about the total cost. He is talking about the extra costs which may fall on farmers, industry and local authorities. I know from experience how important the question of the total cost may be to the effectiveness of the Bill. Could the hon. Gentleman give some idea of the Scottish Office's thinking on the total cost, so that we may see whether we can achieve something useful in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Mabon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the caution characteristic of all Scottish Office officials, of which the right hon. Gentleman is fully aware, we have been unable to get an estimate. On reflection, this is understandable, because not all the work of assessing the possible alternatives to old discharges has been done. Many of these discharges have gone on for a hundred years. It has been difficult to assess what the cost of conversion would be in industry. It is perhaps easier to anticipate this in relation to sewerage works, but, on the other hand, this will be offset by the unknown factors arising from the implications of the Hill Watson Report on drainage. Such a measure would somewhat change the picture of local government thinking in relation to sewerage development, to such an extent that we are unable to make an estimate of it. I regret that these figures are not

available, but since the right hon. Gentleman was in power for a long time I would point out that it is not our fault.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee adjourns, Mr. Steele, I want on behalf of my hon. Friends and myself to express our appreciation of the manner in which you have conducted the proceedings during this debate. It has not been a difficult Committee—perhaps because neither side has yet adjusted itself to its new position—but I think that everybody would agree that you have shown a very pleasant lighthandedness which we hope you will continue to show in future proceedings of this Committee, should you be in the Chair. Certainly we appreciate it very much indeed.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Noble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join in what has been said by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). If this was your first Bill, Mr. Steele, I am sure that it will not be your most difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much indeed. The simple fact is that the Bill has been an easy one. I am looking forward with interest to the next stage.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
