<br><br><!-- lb --> (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That during the further proceedings on the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q>
I shall not say a great deal about this Motion. I said the last time the Committee discussed our procedure, that a great many Members seemed to want to talk on the Bill. I make no complaint about this, because it is a very important Bill. However, if we are to get the Bill and allow time for other matters with which we have to deal this Session, we shall have to have extra Sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also do not want to take up the time of the Committee in discussing the Motion. It is well known that there is rejoicing in heaven over every sinner who repents, and I would like to think that the Minister and his hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) are in this category, partly, I think as a result of the debate that we had the other day. On this occasion, we have had everything done that should be done. We had consultation as to the time which would be most suitable to the Minister, who had great difficulty, as he explained to the Committee, in accepting our idea that Wednesday morning was very much more convenient at least for the Opposition, and he has accepted it. I therefore welcome his change of heart, and we on this side of the Committee will do our best to see that this important Bill is given the consideration which it needs and does not take over long in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the co-operation of the usual channels we know what the Government hope to get through in this Session. We on this side would like to get the Bill through by the right time to suit the Government's programme.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>566</span>
I hope very much that it will be possible for a little more of the available time to be used perhaps by hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee, for the simple reason that it is easier for hon. Gentlemen on the other side to discuss their individual problems with the Minister than it is for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be worth recording that since we last discussed this point there have been another extra 117 columns of HANSARD taken by hon. Members opposite and only an extra 84 columns taken on this side. I think it is therefore clear that we on this side are trying to make our points quickly and shortly and to get ahead with the Bill. I hope this will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not been involved in discussions through the usual channels and therefore this has come to me rather as a surprise. Therefore I wonder if the Minister would clarify two small points about this arrangement. First, I presume that the arrangement will not be starting immediately, but will be delayed till the Bill being taken on the Floor of the House has been dealt with, because it would be most unfortunate if Scottish Members who wish to make contributions to the discussion on that Bill were prevented from doing so. Secondly, what consideration has been given to the possibility, instead of having two Committees in which hon. Gentlemen may want to participate running at the same time, of making an earlier start, say at 9.30 a.m., to allow extra time to enable this Bill to proceed? I should like a little clarification of those two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) I was not involved in any discussions through the usual channels. I was here until a very late hour and I am in much the same position as he, but I have no grievance. I welcome what was said by the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble): we should look forward to the day when the Bill will pass. I hope that the Opposition will co-operate by shortening some of their very lengthy speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would associate myself entirely with what the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>567</span>
said. I am pleased that the Minister intends, not to cut the discussion, but to make provision so that we can finish the Bill quickly without having to shorten the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the manner in which the Committee has accepted the Motion. The right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has counted the columns of HANSARD filled from this side of the Committee. I would remind him that they include the speeches of myself as Minister of State, and that part of those speeches has been taken up with replying to the speeches from the Opposition side as well as from the Government side. I do not quarrel with the substance of what the right hon. Member said, but I want to get the thing into perspective. The length of speeches is a matter over which I have no control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not your own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will listen to the appeal which was made by the right hon. Member in his concluding words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), who asked whether we had considered alternatives, I would remind him that we spent a whole morning considering alternatives and that I myself put that very point about the meeting on the Floor of the House of the Committee on the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill. I believe that by meeting on Wednesday mornings we can proceed with our Bill while the capital punishment Bill is also being considered. It is the wish of hon. Members that we should do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall commence the Wednesday morning Sittings as from next Wednesday, if the Motion is agreed to. I am sorry that the Sittings will coincide with those on the capital punishment Bill but if hon. Members want to go down to listen to the debates on that Bill they can. Having sat through all the proceedings on the capital punishment Bill I must say that I have not seen great enthusiasm to sit through them on the part of many Scottish Members. I am not quite sure, therefore, that it is such a hardship as has been suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>568</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, I know that the hon. Member sat through a certain part of one of the Sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the early moving of the Closure in debates on that Bill we have not been able to put forward the Scottish case for people like prison officers and police officers, who are directly affected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know that the hon. Member spent one morning waiting to make a speech and was unable to do so. I am sorry about that. I helped him with some of the information for his speech, and we were prepared to reply to his speech, and were not allowed to do so. We are not grumbling about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the two Bills coincide, but I do not think there will be much difficulty, except, possibly, in having to supply Ministers to sit on the Government Front Bench to answer points which are raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That during the further proceedings on the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Clause 6.—(CARRYING ON OF BUSINESS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [4th May],</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of adding many columns of HANSARD to the score on the Opposition side of the Committee. I intend to try to stick to my reputation for being concise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the last meeting I asked the Minister whether the Clause applied to businesses of any kind whatever and also whether it applied geographically everywhere in Scotland. From the nodded assent which I thought I saw at the time, I assumed that that is the position. No doubt the Minister will give us a detailed reply later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made it clear, on an Amendment with which were were dealing, that where the Clause provides for acquisitions of a business it is only by agreement. Again, we assume that that is what the wording means, but we would be glad to get that interpretation officially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>569</span>
I have two important points about the powers proposed, and I wish to deploy arguments on them. The first point is that, in combination with the powers provided in Clause 4, and Clause 11 for obtaining information, the Clause we are now discussing could enable a Secretary of State for Scotland, determined to take over as much as possible, to use the Board as his agent, to buy up land by compulsion in such a way as to make it impossible for a business to continue on its own. He could in that way create conditions in which a takeover by agreement would become inevitable, because it would be a takeover by duress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that with his powers to set up a commercial undertaking a Secretary of State who was so disposed could deliberately put existing private enterprise out of business. With the resources of the Treasury at its disposal, and with no need, for years, to pay its way, a business set up by the Secretary of State could put out of business a similar one which might be thriving, if the Secretary of State wished to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should he wish to do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two factors are a positive deterrent to private industry setting up and expanding in the Highlands. If hon. Members visit some of these areas they will find that local authorities are seeking units of light industry. This is pre-eminently a field in which private enterprise can make the best contribution. It would be madness to frighten away firms which could establish enterprises employing from 20 to 100 men by the two factors which I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might mention what is happening in my own constituency, which is very far north, adjoins the crofting counties, and is, therefore, next door to the areas under discussion. I know what contribution private enterprises are making in that area. As I speak, a new light industry is being set up, employing between 20 and 40 men, just the kind of industry required in that area. My constituency is a good case to consider, because no grants or loans are available and there are no development districts in it. An industry which sets itself up there does so on the merits of the situation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>570</span>
and without the grant and loan incentives which are available in development districts all round the area. That industry is establishing itself on the Moray Firth; if it had been 20 or 30 miles further south it would be in a Highland area. It is purely fortuitous that it is just outside the area. Private industry of this kind has an important contribution to make, as well as those made by Government agencies like the Forestry Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed, from his Second Reading speech, that the Secretary of State acknowledges this. He indicated that the powers would be rarely used but would be held in reserve. If the Bill becomes law, what guarantee shall we have that a Secretary of State with different views might not use these powers a great deal more? Armed with the powers to take over land and private enterprise in the Highlands, would, for example, the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. William Hamilton) if he were Secretary of State, simply hold them in reserve and let the dust gather upon them, or would he use them to take over land and enterprises in the Highlands? I would gladly give way to him if he would tell me "Yes" or "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there are different views among hon. Members opposite about how these powers should be used, but we should be grateful for small mercies, and we are therefore, thankful that it has been indicated by the Government that the Ministers who are presently in office would regard these powers as only to be used on special and rare occasions. That was what I understood the Secretary of State to say on Second Reading, but we would be glad to have a more expanded explanation of the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee have, however, to look ahead, and when powers of this kind are being made available by Statute we have to see what the possibilities could be. I am glad to see that not only the Secretary of State but the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs has this kind of view, because in a speech in Glasgow on 2nd May he said:
	<br><q><p>"We accept that it is the Government's business to see that both private enterprise and the public sector can expand because the people who work in private enterprise are just as much our people as those who do not."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>571</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing new about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are glad to hear that, because this reinforces the argument I am putting, that private enterprise has a great contribution to make, as well as State agencies such as the Forestry Commission and the Departments, in helping to promote projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members opposite think it would be a good thing to nationalise all activities in the Highlands and that the Highlands should then be run from Edinburgh and London, I can assure them that they are wrong. This is clearly not the wish of Highlanders and in practice it would not succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What on earth does the hon. Member mean by all this nonsense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear an interruption from a sedentary position, and the inquiry, from what I could hear indicates that hon. Members are not aware of the kind of decision which is to be taken this very day. Later today we are to consider a matter of nationalisation, the kind of matter with which this Clause is dealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no steel in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a threat to a great and efficient industry being put forward today. I am only just mentioning this. How are we to be sure that in future the nationalisation of the Highlands may not become the token of Socialist faith, replacing the nationalisation of steel which seems to be now, and that some Government in future, with views far more Left wing than those of the Minister of State, will not decide that, in order to keep their Left wing in line, which seems to be the object of the operation today, the nationalisation of the Highlands must be carried out? After all, What have they to lose? There is only one seat which they have in the Highlands and no prospect of any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many have the Conservatives got?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this were to happen, and the Highlands were to be jettisoned in this way, we should feel some responsibility if we allowed this kind of Clause to pass through the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>572</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should come clean with the Committee and tell us why he is churning out this foolishness and for whose consumption it is. We have made clear that while there is a great deal of nationalisation in the Highlands—and previous Governments of all colours had to do this to help the economy and other public activity—if private enterprise is prepared to do the job, we are not prepared to go in and upset it. But if it is not so prepared, or deliberately obstructs development in any area, I hope the powers in the Bill will be used, effectively to raise the standards of the people in that area. What can the hon. Member see wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member seems to be making his speech now and I hope he will reserve time for that later. I have been making clear that I recognise that both private enterprise and the Government through Government agencies can operate together. Everyone who can help to develop the Highlands is required. All their contributions are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of conferring powers of this kind is that it will positively deter private enterprise from doing the job which it can and is doing in the Highlands. This is a danger which I recognise that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) may not accept. I must warn the Committee, and it is our duty that we should warn the Committee, that if enormous powers of this kind are passed, and even if the Government of the day make assurances that they will virtually never use them, it none the less can be a great disincentive when people are considering the future and the setting up of projects in the hope that they will exist for many years and be viable. That is the point I am trying to make. The hon. Member paid me the compliment the other day of saying that I usually spoke intelligibly. I return the compliment. So does he. On this we do disagree, but I hope I have made my view clear to him as a result of his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of the Highlands and Islands presents many problems arising from distances, markets and supplies, geography, difficult communications, and also for the fact that large areas consist
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>573</span>
of mountainside on which little can grow. Therefore, with a higher standard of living in the whole country, which has advanced so far in the last twelve years and which we hope will continue, the vital matter for the Highlands is the provision of more jobs which will sustain the higher standard of living. On this we are all agreed. The question is, what are the best methods of obtaining this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would wish to press on with the means we consider to be most likely to be effective for development. This, as I have indicated, means a combination of effort by all those who can contribute. To a change in machinery, such as the Development Board is making, we are not opposed in principle, and we hope that it will permit better results, but we do not think powers of the kind suggested in the Clause, with other powers in Clause 4, are a suitable method. As I have indicated, we are worried and anxious that they may have precisely the opposite effect, in deterring projects which might otherwise have been set up in the Highlands. What are needed are imaginative and viable projects which will create more and more jobs. We are, therefore, strongly opposed to the provisions in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important Clause which should give the Board power to do a great deal of urgently necessary regenerative work—and I use "regenerative" in the broadest sense—and which if used improperly could enable it to compete unfairly with local or other private enterprise. It is, therefore, right to give the Clause close attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only speaker so far, the main Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) said last Tuesday that in his view it was one of the most objectionable Clauses in the Bill and in his opinion it was far too wide. The Committee will remember that when he spoke at that time we were still hearing the echoes of the hollow cries of "Scotland" that we got from Conservative back benchers. I must say honestly that I have not been particularly impressed thus far by the combination of bicker and bombast with which Conservative speakers have approached this Bill. In considering this Clause in principle we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>574</span>
ought to remember that, after all, the reason for this Clause and Bill is the slow rot which has infected the Highlands for so many years. We must ask ourselves who has a large share of responsibility for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not forget also, when hearing these cries about Scotland, that we are listening to them from a party which has been almost totally rejected by the Highlands. Consequently when I hear these back benchers belching belligerent fire I think that if we peer a bit closer we shall find them tinsel flames from paper dragons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a member of the Liberal Party which has fought for a development board for nearly forty years I find it hard to forget that this idea was continually rejected by the Conservative Party when that party was in office. In spite of what the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn said a moment ago, that his party was not opposed to the board in principle, the fact is that when it was proposed to the Conservatives again and again when they were in office they refused to take any action in spite of the evident need for such a board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to the question of need that I now turn. Why does the board need power, as stated in the Clause, to
	<br><q><p>"acquire or set up and carry on any business or undertaking"?</p></q>
I would say, quite simply, because we are trying to build up an area which has run down, not only because of the stultifying effect of the lairds of solitude to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie) referred in his maiden speech, but also because of the connivance of a Government in allowing the convergence of population into the conurbations and by allowing and implicitly acquiescing in this movement.

In order to check this trend I would have thought the Board would have to have powers to do two things. The first would be to step in where private industry has failed but where it is nevertheless clearly undesirable, from the point of view of the development of an area in which the particular project is sited, that the project should die. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) early in the Committee quoted the example of Perrins of Stornoway. This might well be the kind

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
of thing which the Government are thinking about. I shall return to this particular case in a moment because it has other repercussions. The Minister of State quoted Brora colliery in which the Highland Fund has been able to step in and help and where there were people willing to operate it themselves, a good example of co-ownership, to make a party point. But if the Highland Fund had not been able to do this, and if the local people had been unable to supply the expertise which they were, I would have thought it still desirable to keep the thing going. This would be an instance in which the Board should step in, but could not step in without this Clause. I have in my own constituency a diatomite factory at Raasay in Skye. Secondly, the Board needs powers such as outlined in the Clause in order to step into areas where private enterprise has not trod or is unwilling to tread. For certain communities at present this might be the only chance of survival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, as I am sure the hon. Member for the Western Isles thinks, of the smaller islands. I think, for example, of Raasay, in respect of which I am having some trouble just now in trying to persuade the Secretary of State to maintain a proper transport service. In Raasay there are large deposits of iron which are marginally unworkable from the point of view of private enterprise, and it might be that the Board could take a positive lead there. Perhaps similar action could be taken in respect of the other small islands, some of which used to support large populations. The other day I put down a Question to the Secretary of State, whose Answer revealed that the population of Skye has declined from 22,000 only 120 years ago to its present figure of roughly 7,000. It is vital that the Board should be able to carry out these two primary categories of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is, how shall we give the Board the power to do that without, in the words of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn allowing that power, in its theoretical application, to go far too wide? This is an extremely difficult question even for the Wizards of Oz who sit in St, Andrew's House. We can do two things. First, we can hedge the power
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
of the Board, and, secondly, we can make it clear by our interpretation of these provisions that the use of the Board's power in certain contexts would be improper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have done two things to hedge the power of the Board. They have made it clear that the Clause would be used only by agreement. That is not specified in the Bill, but it was made clear as a result of the questionings of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). The Minister confirmed that no question of a compulsory power of acquisition was involved here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am right in my assumption. I thought that my hon. Friend the Minister of State said that he hoped to look at the matter. He mentioned that after the word "acquire" he would consider inserting "by agreement". We are not entirely in agreement about the proposition. That is the stage that we have reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not standing here in the belief that everything I say is agreed, and in any case the Minister will be replying, but to me it seemed that the Government were hedging the power of the Board, in that any question of compulsory purchase was practically ruled out, and secondly, by making it subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, not to mention our old draconian friend the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From this it would seem that even if it might be the desire of the poor old hon. Member—I do not know if that is the proper expression—for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), who has been almost relunctantly dragged into the arena, to nationalise the Highlands, he just could not do it. The idea to which the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) gave great currency shortly after the introduction of the Bill—that it was a sort of Frankenstein monster, running amok round the Highlands, consuming everything—does not hold water. The right hon. Member knows that the existing powers of the Secretary of State are very wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn seemed to be looking ahead into the future, to a time when the hon. Member for Fife, West reigned supreme as the Kosygin of Cowdenbeath. If such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>577</span>
a situation ever occurred—and it is very hypothetical—we would have to assume that the Government would be of his complexion, and that the whole of its policy would be directed towards his objective, and that whatever the Bill contained the Government would be proceeding to the nationalisation of the Highlands. This argument is not logical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the other situation, which is just as likely, in which a large section of the party forming the Government was in favour of the hon. Member's concept, and that in order to keep them on the line the Government felt that they had to carry out this policy, even though the majority of the party might not desire it. I gave, as a passing reference, the example of what is happening today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very bad example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely hypothetical. If there were this dominant element the Government would be introducing stronger measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must address ourselves to the Question, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Steele.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion the danger of the improper use of the powers contained in the Clause lies not so much with wholesale appropriation by the Board but rather with the possibility of State-subsidised competition with existing industry or introduced industry. I do not believe that competition between public and private industry is by any means a bad thing, provided it is fair. I think of the example of MacBrayne's, however. We all know that the Western Isles belong to MacBrayne's. The hon. Member for the Western Isles knows this himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we shall not have a discussion of MacBrayne's. I can visualise such a discussion going on for a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I wanted to do was very briefly to point out the fact that MacBrayne's are suspected of undercutting local land hauliers. It is often thought that the subsidies paid in respect of their sea traffic are used on land in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>578</span>
this way. That is an example of the way in which a State-subsidised or controlled enterprise can unfairly compete with private enterprise in a certain situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the Perrins factory earlier, as something which the Board might take over. In that case, how would competition with existing weavers and similar people develop? People in my constituency are very concerned about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it is in order to refer to Clause 11; I am approaching the end of my argument, and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn referred to it. If we couple Clauses 6 and 11—and they are related—we have, first, provision for the setting up of industry, and then powers to investigate competitors. This creates a potentially dangerous situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is making his position quite clear. He is not against the Board's exercising its powers in any way so long as it does not compete with private enterprise. I take it that he would support the location of a steel works in some part of the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good question! If the Labour Government proposed to set up a steel works by expending public money I would accept this. I think that the right hon. Member for Argyll would also accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member agree that it would be unlikely that the Government would do anything like that under this Measure? It would probably be done under other legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. It is a hypothetical question, and the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) is a hypothetical person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister for two categorical assurances. I know that he cannot speak in absolute terms, but he can say what the Government intend by the Clause—and that will have a large influence on what use is made of the Board. First, I trust that it is the intention not to use the Clause in order to compete with existing industry and thus to expand the net of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>579</span>
State-controlled industry, which could snuff out other industry. I do not think that this is likely. I am sure that the Minister will be able to assure me on this point. Secondly, can he assure me that the principal objective and aim of the Clause is to act where private industry has failed? That has been indicated by the Secretary of State, but I hope that the Minister will confirm it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fears are based not so much on this Clause as on the possibility that the Government will not give the Board enough money even to make these provisions fully effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) has reproduced his very carefully prepared Aunt Sallies, designed to whip up fear in the Highlands about the powers conferred in the Bill, and especially fears lest I should become Secretary of State for Scotland. I have always made my position clear about the Bill. I speak only for myself in this matter, and the Minister of State may be glad to know that before I sit down. I want to destroy the landowners in the Highlands, and to the extent that the Bill goes along that road it is fine by me. Having said that, I hope that hon. and right hon. Members will not attempt to distort my views. That is what I stand for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me, however, that the hysteria of the Tory Party, which has been evident ever since the Bill was produced, is the hysteria of guilty men, as the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) has just said. It has been part of the pattern of gross exaggeration, distortion and misrepresentation of what the Bill is about and what it is for. The Tory Party hopes that this will serve as an adequate substitute for the complete absence of positive alternative policies on the Tories' part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State said in the Second Reading debate, the Clause is no more than an enabling Clause. That is eminently sensible, based on past experience. In the highly respectable 	<i>Scotsman</i> on 23rd April, the editorial said:
	<br><q><p>"As an earnest of their resolve to put the Highlands right Labour are fulfilling their pledge to establish a Highland Board. Its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>580</span>
powers have alarmed the Tories, who are not improving their hopes of recovery by dire predictions about the uses to which the Board might put its authority. It is unlikely to establish a tyranny, and it would be futile to appoint it without powers which are enjoyed by other public authorities as a reserve weapon against private obstruction."</p></q>
That is what the Clause does; it is a reserve power against possible private obstruction. There is no doubt that the landowners of Scotland will seek to obstruct. They do not want the kind of development which we visualise for the Highlands. My hon. Friend the Minister of State during the Committee, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State during the Second Reading debate, were marvels of moderation. They may speak softly, but they have to carry a very big stick, and that is what this and other Clauses represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote from the magazine 	<i>Property</i> on this point. I hope the Committee will forgive me quoting at length, but it shows the kind of alarmist talk which is being engaged in by those guardians of individual liberty. The April edition of the magazine states:
	<br><q><p>"The Government's Highland Development Board goes directly against all such principles"—</p></q>
that is, individual rights of holding property and being able to seek the protection of the law against the invasion of that right.
	<br><q><p>"Its terms come so near to establishing in one region a bureaucratic socialist dictatorship at the expense of private rights, that the North of Scotland might well find itself turning into another East Germany. In fact, so extensive and general are the powers the Bill would confer, that just one steel nationalisation Bill would seem almost small fry by comparison. It must be agreed that Scotland, especially in the Highlands, is in need of action to develop its resources, but it must also be recognised"—</p></q>
this is 	<i>Property</i>—the landowners—speaking—
	<br><q><p>"that population, like trade and industry, has settled more in other parts of the British Isles than in the Highlands for sound economic and social reasons and these reasons will not be permanently altered by bulldozing aside individual rights and liberties."</p></q>
When I hear about and read magazines like 	<i>Property,</i> and listen to people it represents calling in aid the need to protect the rights of citizens, I recall the clearances which my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>581</span>
Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will recall. We must remember that kind of episode when we talk about individual rights. It is in this context that this Bill is being produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magazine article goes on:
	<br><q><p>"Russia might be able to ram through its Virgin Lands policy in Siberia, because the Soviet citizen has little to say in how his money is used, but the mere act of requisiting private land in the Highlands in order to set up a model factory there to make State gudeon pins will not bring prosperity. It is more likely to cost the taxpayer a packet. So, too, would the harnessing of a puddle-size loch to churn out a few watts of electricity."</p></q>
It is the voice of the landowners, the voice of property, that this Bill is designed to curb.
	<br><q><p>"The Government should look at this Bill again. If passed, it will make law of a kind, but it will be an act of contempt for the rule of law evolved here over centuries."</p></q>
The other day the House of Lords invoked the rule of law and we saw to what purpose. We shall see in greater detail later on to what purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar comment was made in the 	<i>Justice of the Peace and Local Government Review</i> of 17th April. I will not quote in great detail from that magazine, but it went on, having raised the nightmare prospect of how these powers might be exercised by the Highland Board:
	<br><q><p>"Given the approval of the Secretary of State and sufficient funds from the Treasury it could, in theory at least, take over the whole area."</p></q>
That is true.
	<br><q><p>"Of course it will do no such thing. But it could have a vital effect, for better or worse, on the inhabitants of the area far greater than any other existing body."</p></q>
This is the revolutionary aspect of the Bill, this is what I like about it. For the first time the feudal powers in the Highlands have been given warnings of the consequences of their continued obstruction which has retarded the development of the Highlands for centuries. The private enterprise which hon. Gentlemen opposite so loudly praise has failed demonstrably. We are giving notice that it cannot go on any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article goes on:
	<br><q><p>"If it a success, it could serve as a model for similar bodies in other regions."</p></q>
That also is true, and I welcome this Clause and other Clauses linked with it,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>582</span>
in so far as they enable the Board to act in conjunction with the Secretary of State, who will be answerable to Parliament. That is the important thing. The Board is armed with powers, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State who will be answerable to the elected assembly of Parliament. To me this seems reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the problem of the Highlands will be solved wholly and solely by public enterprise, but there can be no doubt that it will play, and is now playing, a major part, which will become increasingly greater in future, in the development of these areas. In so far as this Bill enables that to happen I welcome it, and this Clause, which is moving in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) I regard this Clause with apprehension. Having heard the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) give his views, I regard it with even more apprehension. Like all right hon. and hon. Members on this side of the Committee I regard nationalisation as a very bad thing. Later today I shall have no hesitation in making that very clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend actually heard the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) say, "A very good thing" when it was suggested from this side of the Committee that the Highlands might be nationalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we ought to confine ourselves to debating the Question before the Committee and not have a debate which is to take place this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it was in order to mention that debate in order to illustrate my views on nationalisation generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the Clause, although I have many apprehensions about it I feel—I say this right at the beginning of my speech—that I cannot agree with my hon. Friend in his opposition to this Clause standing part of the Bill. I do not like the Clause, and I hope that the Minister of State will give me some assurances about it, but it seems that it is a vital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
Clause, and so it ought to stand part of the Bill. I hope that the Minister of State will make some sort of modification of it and give some assurances about it. He is an honourable man and I regard with great respect such honourable undertakings as he gives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a special case in the Highlands and Islands, and there are various parts in the north of Scotland which are similar in character. I hope that ultimately the provisions in this Bill will be extended to include those parts. I speak with some knowledge, because I am, probably to a greater extent than any other hon. Member on this side of the Committee, a representative of the type of country affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Highlands and Islands and in certain other parts of the north of Scotland we have a special case which is quite different from that of any other part of the United Kingdom. If this Clause were applied to any other part, I should have more than misgivings about it. The case in the north of Scotland is a desperate one, and desperate ills require desperate remedies. I do not like the Clause; I cannot vote for it; but I shall not vote against it, and I should like to explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency one finds village after village and little town after little town slowly but surely dying. Young people find there is no industry in the area, especially in the winter months, and the populations in those places are ageing. It is absolutely vital to get some sort of industry for those people. It is all very well to say that private enterprise can produce employment. I do not believe that it can in many cases because there is no pool of people looking for employment in these places. The number of people concerned is very small and it would not be economic for a private developer to set up a factory or something of that kind. If it were practicable I think that it would be done, as has happened in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the valuable publication on employment use in the Highlands I find that I am supported in this view by what is stated in paragraph 116 of the Report of this eminent and well-informed Committee:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>584</span>
	<br><q><p>"So far as the use for industrial development is concerned, we can distinguish between factory industries (not using the natural resources of the area) and industries based on the exploitation of the natural resources."</p></q>
In a great many of these villages there are still a number of people with good will and some capital, but with a complete lack of knowhow in the factory or workshop use of natural resources. They might set up a small affair but could not possibly employ the managing skills required. These people would be chary about investing capital in something they did not know about and without the appropriate managing skill. In such cases the Highland Development Board could do a great deal to provide managing skill and knowhow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board should have the power to deal with drastic situations not by producing light industry of a type which could be formed in London or anywhere else but of a type appropriate to the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that precisely the kind of contribution the Board is empowered to make under the following Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. Under the following Clause the Board is empowered to give advisory and other services, but here it may be necessary for the Board to seize the initiative and set up little industries. Although I detest nationalisation in any form—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like that at Dounray?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—in the special circumstances there is a clamant necessity for some central authority, invested with money, which could seize the initiative and produce what is required. In my constituency there are famous and familiar places like Braemar, Ballater and so on. They are well known to visitors, and in the summer they are busy, bustling places. In the winter, when the visitors have gone, they are absolutely dead. There is nothing for people to do and they are too small for industry to be attracted from the South. What must happen is that someone must take the initiative and provide the knowhow. To that extent this Clause, or something like it, is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will give an assurance about the use he intends to make of this Clause and I will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>585</span>
accept the assurance that he will not use this as a blanket for nationalisation in the Highlands. I mentioned the distinction made by the Advisory Panel on the Highlands and Islands between urbanisation and the factory industries, and those using local resources. I think it worth while reminding the Committee what the Advisory Panel said in paragraph 116, on page 66:
	<br><q><p>"The development of industries based on local resources raises somewhat different considerations. Generally speaking, such enterprises will be for the exploitation of natural resources. The nature and extent of natural resources in the Highlands and Islands tend to be underestimated. These are summarised in Appendix I."</p></q>
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advisory Panel went on to say in paragraph 116:
	<br><q><p>"… insufficient quantity and quality, the possibilities of exploitation should be affectively investigated. We believe that it is not good enough to leave the initiative in this respect to private concerns (who may have other preoccupations and who may find alternative sources of supply convenient). We recommend, therefore, that the means of investigating these natural resources should be given early attention by the new Natural Resources Council when it is established. Such investigation should include not only the scientific and physical aspects of exploitation but also the probable economics".</p></q>
That is vital, because no matter how good a landowner may be, unless he sees a reasonable return on his capital he will not spend the large quantities of money which must be spent to prove the deposits, however desirable it may be that that should be done from the national point of view. Here I disagree with the hon. Member for Fife, West, for I believe there are three types of landlord, the good, the bad and the in different—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but there comes a stage when one cannot expect the vast sums which must be spent to investigate mineral resources to be expended by landlords, particularly since that investigation may be of very little importance to them, however important it may be in the national interest. It is vital, therefore, that there should be an authority with power to take the initiative not only to invest but possibly to carry on an industry which may be uneconomic for a considerable period but which may become economic and viable later on. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>586</span>
is the crux of the matter. It is the distinction which the Advisory Panel made between firms using the natural resources of the area and other firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that if the Minister of State, or indeed, the Secretary of State, came clean and gave us some indication of the way in which their minds are working and what their intentions are, regarding projects, places, and so on, the Committee would have greater ease in making up its mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend, because that was exactly the point to which I was coming. I want the Minister of State to give an indication of what he has in mind for the use of the Clause, because many of my hon. Friends, and others, have misgivings about its operation. I realise the importance of the Clause, but it is liable to be abused. As I said, the Minister of State is an honourable man and I am—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not we all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—prepared to accept his honourable assurances—of course we are. We are all hon. Members here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister gives assurances and the Government ultimately break them Scotland will know what to do about it. In the meantime, I am prepared to listen to him because I believe that the Clause is of considerable importance to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of forestry. It is a difficult matter, particularly since there are many different points of view about it, such as how far it should or should not be developed in Scotland. Forestry represents resources which are peculiar to certain areas. It has a long history in the Highlands, where a great many industries used to be based on forestry. I do not see why many of them cannot be revived. However, to do so might be extremely expensive because of the plant and equipment involved—certainly too expensive for any individual landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there is probably the last remaining bucket mill in Scotland. The firm makes wooden buckets, tubs and so on, for which there is a large demand, mainly for ornamental purposes, particularly in gardens. This little mill,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>587</span>
probably the last survivor of the industry, has unfulfilled orders going back a considerable time. With the injection of some capital, management and selling techniques it could be built into a profitable little industry based on the woodland areas of Scotalnd. We must also consider the wood-turning industry. Throughout the Highlands a great many mills were once—and a few still are—making bobbins and turned articles for the furniture industry. A central organisation could do a lot for the wood-turning industry of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is agriculture. Even in this industry the Board could play an important part. The Advisory Panel stated in paragraph 56 of its Report:

The Advisory Panel there envisaged the land being operated by private farmers, but its recommendation requires a central authority to co-ordinate those activities, to make the land into farms and so on. Perhaps the Board or another central authority might have to farm the land.

The Clause has a useful part to play. I am apprehensive about it, as are my hon. Friends. I am sure that we can trust the Minister not to abuse the provision, as long as he gives assurances that he will not abuse it. I warn him that the people of Scotland would take remedial action in the event of any abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) made what is now becoming a typical Tory speech, expressing horrors at nationalisation or State intervention in general, but going on, at the same time to demand special State aid and Government treament for each area which each Tory Member represents. Is it not becoming rather absurd to go trumpeting "keep out" warnings where intervention
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>588</span>
by the Government is clearly of benefit to the whole nation, while demanding that the State come in when private enterprise has got into difficulty in particular areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An excellent example of this contradiction arose in the very illustration he gave of the little wooden bucket making firm in his constituency. As long as the firm was making nice little buckets and nice little profits the State and the public should keep out. But, as soon as the little private bucket firm begins to threaten to kick the bucket, so to speak, help from public money is demanded to save it. Only a little infusion of capital—in other words, a little subsidy—is required, hon. Gentlemen opposite always say. Likewise, as soon as one of the great steel firms gets into difficulty or wants to develop—or, perhaps I should say, is under pressure to develop, as we had with Colvilles—the little buckets are again produced—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret to say that the landlords are in rather the same position. I hasten to add that a number of progressive landlords took a traditional part in the development of Scottish forestry. They did great pioneering work in the eighteenth century. But then, before the coming of the dedication grants, there were decades-long gaps in private afforestation development because no public money was being provided. Then came the dedication grants and subventions and private afforestation revived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forestry industry as a whole suffered as a result of the lack of development during several decades. This was vividly illustrated during the two world wars, when the supply of timber from our indigenous sources amounted to only about 4 per cent. of the nation's wartime needs. The lives of men and ships in convoys had to be risked to import it because of the lack of a proper forestry policy in former years. The nation is now much more conscious of the need to develop our timber-growing areas to the fullest extent.

Nevertheless, while private enterprise takes credit for its efforts and the contribution it makes to Highland development, that enterprise is nearly always on the basis of assistance, in one form or another, from State funds. Perhaps that consciousness of their dependence on public funds is being shown by hon. Gentlemen opposite when nowadays they show less violent resistance to Clauses of the type we are discussing. Today they are not out and out in their opposition to the Bill as a whole, only to some of the most vital operative parts of it, particularly the parts which are most important to its success, the parts which are, in their view, most radical in conception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that among any assurances my hon. Friend may give when replying, he will give the strongest possible assurance that he intends to make this Clause work and do what it says, because it is one of the most important moving and working parts of the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on to say that I hoped that the Minister, like the rest of my hon. Friends, visualises a full-time or virtually full-time Board which will be concerned with the exercise of industrial initiatives right through, to the point, if necessary—where other agencies are not doing the task—of operating manufacturing industries. This is urgently and widely needed in the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite claim to speak for the Highlands. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West even said that he spoke for Scotland. I remind them that they are in an even weaker position than they were before the last election to speak for the Highlands and Islands or for Scotland. The statistics and Election results show that the Labour and Liberal Paries now are voices speaking for that area; and that is likely to remain the position for a very long time indeed. Thus, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West is not in a very great position to speak for his own area, let alone for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>590</span>
Scotland with the confidence he had even before the last election. That applies to all Tory hon. Members. Not even their one Highland Member speaks with more than a minority voice in the Highlands and Islands today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited repeatedly most parts of this vast area, both before and after the establishment of the Highland Panel. I assure the Committee that its people crave manufacturing industry. In every county, including island areas, light industry is urgently needed. The people need the industrial second job, without which even the first—crofting, agriculture and the rest—will not be sustained. On the second job depends the whole economy of the area, including agriculture. The sooner we get that into our heads the better for all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What on earth do hon. Gentlemen opposite think the Highlanders and Islanders are pursuing when they leave their homes to take what for them is the second job—in industry, factory and on the sea—and perhaps travel to the other end of the world? They are seeking the industrial job and livelihood because it is not provided for them at home by either private enterprise or the Government. Our task must be to provide the industrial job at home and so enable people in the Highlands and Islands to have a decent standard of life in their own homeland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the declared policy of all parties to sustain the communities in the Highlands and Islands, not merely to keep the total present population of the region, but to ensure a proper distribution of population in existing communities. No party has dissented from that view and every party has subscribed to it as being an essential part of Government policy.

We must, therefore, find a means of sustaining these Highland areas populations in their own, and of attaining for them a reasonable standard of living. I hope that the Bill and this Clause will help to provide the means for doing so. Everyone appears to be looking to the proposed Board for help in doing things which have not been done by other agencies in the past. I believe that we have throughout Scotland a very great deal of support for this Highlands and Islands Development Board, equipped

with real powers and armed with real biting teeth.

I heard with some surprise the pleas for national expenditure in aid of private enterprise from hon. Members opposite, after their partisan condemnation of public intervention in a field—in the Highlands and Islands—where it has proved absolutely essential and where public enterprise has amply proved itself, not only an experimental but as a highly practical success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will be the basis for extensive and intelligent socialist economic planning and development. There is no reason for muting our advocacy or for pretending we want it to be otherwise. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) has been targeted for attack by 4he Tories as a Left-wing extremist because, I am sure, he also looks forward to that prospect. I thought he was very cautious today. Indeed, he has been on my right-wing politically on many occasions. I do not know why hon. Members opposite should select him for their partisan opprobrium; I am sure he would agree he has been a most moderate advocate in our counsels here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landowners in my view, like my hon. Friends, are simply not essential to the Highlands. Many of them have had to be paid off every time before even private enterprise, let alone public enterprise, could develop in the Highlands. Some hon. Members opposite imagined that the Government, by means of this Bill, should sink public money into State-promoted enterprises, and then hand them over, when they begin to show profit, to private enterprise. Let us imagine the officials of the new Highland Board visiting some of those privately-owned areas. They would probably first meet a gamekeeper, with his little gun, and he would warn them off the land, indicating the notices, "Trespassers will be prosecuted." One notorious notice in Skye used to say, "Keep out! The soft-nosed bullet travels far." They might eventually meet the factor of the estate. They just might meet an odd landowner—though seldom in the Highlands and Islands. They would be more likely to have to locate him or his representative in his offices in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>592</span>
We remember the negotiations which have taken place from time to time for the use of Highland land by the Scottish Hydro-Electric Board's valuable development schemes and the way in which Highland development has been prevented or delayed in the course of protracted disputes with landlords over fishing compensation and land they never themselves developed. The landlords know that this Board, this State enterprise has to pay up or else suffer delays of month after month—even years—revenue-losing delays, which, in money-loss value, may run to many hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Hydro-Electric Board has often had to succumb to these landlord pressures while the cost of their civil engineering projects went up and up and the potential revenue was being lost. This is a very powerful form of pressure by private interests, but that is exactly the sort of thing that has been happening, and it is the reason why we must have very strong reserve powers at the command of the proposed Highland Development Board to enable it to face more effectively that sort of situation. It is high time that the form of blackmail and obstruction which has been the rule with certain Highland landlords were done away with once and for all. They should not be able to carry this policy of obstruction, based on the prospect that, if they are obstructive enough, they must be bought off by exorbitant compensation. Local authorities and private persons and public development authorities have suffered every possible obstruction and costly exploitation by Highland landlordism. I ought to say that there has been among the best landlords a few honourable exceptions, who have been just as much ashamed as the Highlands and Islands generally have been at what was done by these other landlords, many of whom have been and could again readily be named.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West presented a quotation to the Committee. I would like to present a quotation of my own:
	<br><q><p>"Roads are made, streets are made, railway services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains—and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour and cost of other people. … To not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>593</span>
one of those improvements does the land monopolist, as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced. He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own enrichment is derived. … The citizens are losing their chance of developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing the taxes that would have accrued if the natural development had taken place, and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other ratepayers and taxpayers; and the nation as a whole is losing in the competition of the world—the hard and growing competition of the world—both in time and money. And all the while the land monopolist has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on his part. And that is justice!"</p></q>
That quotation is not from any Left-wing Socialist. It is from a speech by the late Sir Winston Churchill, when he was in his best form. Hon. Members opposite who have rightly paid tributes to his memory, as we have, too, might sometimes remember the speeches that he made on landlordism and land monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause should be strengthened, not modified. It is as well to recognise honestly that it is nearly always impossible for private enterprise to set up business on a worthwhile scale in the Highlands and Islands without assistance from public funds in one form or another. We in the Labour Party are not implacably opposed to that; but where the taxpayers' money is put on a big scale into private firms, the State and the public should have a continuous interest in them and in the profits this has made possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A little industry of considerable local value has been developing in my own constituency—the seaweed processing industry. This development would not have happened but for the original use of large sums of public money, spent upon research by marine biologists, botanists and others. Well over £400,000 of public money was put into the basic research which made possible the development of this industry. I do not regret it. It has been a very good investment. However, when it comes to getting the full advantage of that research and exploitation of the Islands' seaweed resources, at the manufacturing stages, it is not my area which is considered, or which benefits. The manufacturing is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>594</span>
not done where the raw materials are obtained and are being exploited to produce a vast variety of products. The dried raw materials are shipped off to some other area in the South where the manufacturing takes place. In my constituency the hard, heavy manual job of cutting and carrying is performed—a job that not everybody wants to do. Of course, a certain amount of valuable employment is created; but it seems utterly wrong that we should not see the full development to the point of actual manufacture in the area where the natural local raw materials are being exploited and extracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of thing one would want to see done—assisted development to that point of local manufacturing—through the powers and assistance of the new Highlands and Islands Development Board. The reason why it is not done now is—we are always being told—that it does not pay firms to manufacture in the Western Isles. The £400,000 worth of research was begun during wartime and went on for several post-war years; so most of the basic research work was done for them. There should be pressure upon all such firms to develop all their production locally. They should have a sense of responsibility to the areas whose raw materials they are exploiting for their private profit. They can show that best by setting up manufacturing there. Where there is a factor of higher capital cost is between manufacturing in my area and in mainland areas further south, then there might be a case for public money coming in to make up that difference in capital and, even, operating, costs. We ought to consider that. I see very little reason why we should not apply what I might call the doctrine of equalisation of industrial costs in many cases of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want industry to go to the Islands and Highlands areas. We want manufacturing industries. But, if we want firms to go to these areas, although they may face lower costs in the industrial areas, then, clearly, there is a very powerful case for giving special assistance to firms who are willing to go to areas such as my own, if they cannot afford to meet the additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the fears of hon. Members opposite about the powers contained in the Clause. Their fear of State
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>595</span>
enterprise is absurd. We are already operating a number of State industries, very important industries indeed. The Dounreay atomic project has been mentioned and the Atomic Energy Authority's other projects elsewhere. Dounreay would not have been possible under private enterprise; it just would not have happened. No private firm could have undertaken it, without vast support from public funds. Hydro-electricity is a Highland basic service, and an industry which has given considerable employment to Highlanders and others. All Highland development of this kind inevitably also provides employment for firms and labour from lowland areas also. Highland and other agriculture gives a great deal of work and profit to lowland engineering industry, not only in Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom. The Herring Industry Board and White Fish Industry Board have made possible the survival of the two industries which private enterprise could not sustain. More recently, in order to keep shipping firms in the Orkneys and Shetlands going at all, the Government had to step in, to have ships constructed; while elsewhere subsidies have been necessary on a big scale. I do not know why Conservatives at this stage should still profess to fear State enterprise in the Highlands and Islands. Certainly we in the Highlands and Islands do not. We welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highlands and Islands are accustomed to the State as landlord. Not only the Forestry Commission but the Department of Agriculture are among the biggest landlords in Scotland and have been for many years. I do not see why there should be any fears now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of whether there must always be agreement to acquire I think we would all wish to see goodwill and justice prevail. We would all wish that as much as possible, should be done when land has to be taken over by the Board, by agreement till public policy does change, if it does, in favour of the nationalisation of land. We do want, in the meantime, the best possible relations with landlords and everyone else in the Highlands, provided they are prepared to reciprocate; but the Board must have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>596</span>
these powers of pressure and even of coercion, subject to public supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
And we shall have that supervision. We have the Secretary of State, the Treasury, the report of the Board, and if another Amendment is carried, there is the provision for publishing the Board's proposals and the Government's reasons in case of rejection, and all the rest. We have the right to discuss in Parliament, a right to scrutinise from day to day through Questions to the Secretary of State and also through the demand for discussion time in the House. So there are any amount of safeguards in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suggest that we want on all sides to have only what compulsion is necessary and I cannot see many cases arising where coercion will be employed. Nevertheless one can come up against a case of sheer cussed obstruction, stupid or unreasonable. There is one going on in my constituency the outcome of which I do not want to prejudge. For years public authorities, including the Highland Panel since about 1959–60, have been most anxious to utilise a farming area which is not very fully exploited, first of all for milk and dairy farming and latterly, part of it, for housing purposes. All through there has been obstruction by an individual; and now, at last, after many years, a local authority has had to have recourse to its powers to acquire compulsorily. It seems such a pity that desirable development should be obstructed by a dog-in-the-manger attitude of individuals or interests. This sort of case has happened in many parts of the Highlands, but I do not myself think that we will frequently come up against cases in which it will be necessary to acquire a business as such or an undertaking by compulsion. But this is the sort of case that might arise and I think that reserve powers for the Board are proper against such a contingency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine why hon. Members opposite should want to leave out so completely a reserve power that is now quite commonly accepted under existing legislation. It is not as though this were a precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Member, apart from the New Towns Act, 1946, give an example of the powers in this Clause 6, because I have looked with care

into this and have been unable to find powers quite as wide as this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about the proposed powers as applied directly there to individual businesses. I agree that in that respect we are employing a new vocabulary. But the general conception if this reserve power is there already and in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one sense, indeed, town and country planning was accepted as an escape from the need for land nationalisation by the Labour Government as well as the Tories; though, put in a less negative way, the powers are still appreciable. Nevertheless, though it is to a large extent a compromise arrangement, yet if properly used it can be, and has been of the highest constructive and development value. Without those powers under town and country planning a great many developments would have taken a great deal longer to have been achieved. I do not think any Conservative Member would want to go back to the days before these powers were available. Indeed, they sponsored some of the legislation themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, the importance of this Clause is to ensure that there is as little unreasonable obstruction as possible to the Board's purpose of creating employment, of new jobs and, if necessary, factories—actual industrial manufacturing—and all the new development visualised by the Labour Party as promised under the late Hugh Gaitskell and the present Prime Minister on behalf of this Party. I have repeatedly quoted both of them in this Committee in showing that their intention in the last two elections was that, where private enterprise was not doing the job and providing employment, then, if necessary, State factories would be created to undertake that vital job of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what the Highlands and Islands are waiting for. They are hoping that under the Bill they will see a considerable measure of industrialisation. Sir David Robertson, who was hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland before the last election, is one who, from the Tory benches, spoke most clearly for the Highlands and Islands. He was highly progressive on that subject. I believe myself that in many ways this is one of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>598</span>
the most important Clauses of the Bill and I hope that the Minister will indicate his intention to strengthen and not weaken it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the example I gave earlier of a firm in my constituency, cited today by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) this is an example where it is highly important that the Board or some agency should be able to come in and take action to help a worthwhile private enterprise where it is in, at least, temporary difficulties. This Clause and certain other provisions may well work out as being helpful to private enterprise in problems of this kind. Here is a case where there is, at present, no possibility of help from BOTAC—at least we are told so. The Highland Fund apparently says that it is not prepared and willing out of its own funds to help—or, indeed, from the public fund it administers. Now who is to be able to help in cases of this kind? There is a case possibly for acquisition by some agency by agreement in such instances rather than complete collapse. A strong case can be made out sometimes for that. A firm itself might be anxious to be bought out and acquired, to be taken over by agreement, or to share the job. I am not sure by any means that this is the sort of job I would like the Board to have to do too often; but it might help a firm to survive by being tided over a bad spell. I hope there will be at the disposal of the Board funds which will enable it to tide-over firms in trouble of this kind without the firms being actually taken over. At the moment there is no provision under any agency or legislation for helping when in difficulty, even temporarily, such a private firm as with a good record of employer and worker whose continuation is a matter of local necessity and concern. There is no fund to which they can turn. They cannot, even if they want to, be either tided-over or taken over by any public agency even by agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might well be that when a private enterprise is in difficulty, like the bucket making firm mentioned, in West Aberdeenshire, it might well wish merely to be enabled to make itself sufficiently viable to be attractive for taking over or merged in a more viable entity. It might come to the Board and say "What can you do to help us to avoid complete
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>599</span>
collapse?" There are stages between an act of taking over or getting someone else to take over at where we could perhaps sustain the firm by a bit of temporary tide-over capital. I think the Minister should consider leaving the Board freedom to help in that respect. The Board might well have these powers at least implied in the provisions of the Bill, so it is important to know where we stand on this. As to the Clause as a whole I hope we will regard this as one of the spinal clauses of the Bill and that the Minister will reject any attempt to weaken it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate up to the moment on this short but important Clause of five lines. The issue is quite simple; it is not involved. On this side of the Committee we believe that the Board should have power to

Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite are rather afraid of this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the course of this debate I have not discovered any other reason for objecting to this power. The only reason I have heard up to the present advanced by hon. Members opposite—I am not quite correct about this but it is the main reason advanced—is one of fear. I am glad I am not a Tory. To have to go to bed with a constant nagging dread in the head that someone is going to nationalise something and place it under public ownership must be an enormous mental strain and cause hon. Members opposite sleepless nights. It really is so unreal. I thought this argument about private and public enterprise was almost dead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has misunderstood what I was saying. It is not a question of fear. An industry which might be considering establishing a factory in the Highlands is not going to be afraid or fearful. It will simply go somewhere else. That is what we are saying. We do not want to deter an industry. It is not a question of industry living in fear. It will, unfortunately, go to some other part of the country and that will not help the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>600</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said there was one other point in the Opposition argument apart from fear—I corrected myself if the hon. Member will remember—and I was going to come to it, namely the argument that this might deter people from starting business in the Highlands. I am prepared to agree there might be and probably is an element of validity in this argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However by and large the language of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite when the Bill was published and the hon. Gentleman this morning and also during Second Reading has been this constant reiteration that we want to nationalise the Highlands and everything in them and that everyone will become a serf. The quotation given by my hon. Friend was published not by a Socialist organisation but by a body of men who mainly, I would have thought, were Conservative in their outlook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this really the world we are living in? Where would the Highlands be today without public enterprise and public money? We must get this into perspective. Almost everything—not entirely everything—that has happened in the Highlands in the past twenty or thirty years has happened as a result directly of public enterprise or public money—and very large sums too. This is the reality of today, and I do not see that the Highlander has become any less independent as a result of it. He still strikes me, whenever I go north, as independently minded. I do not consider him to be a kind of serf, which is what the hon. Gentleman talked about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are up against problems in the Highlands which have not been solved by the ordinary means of private enterprise, private ownership and private landowners. None of these has been able to solve the problem. Therefore we have to use other methods and clearly when we use other methods they are going to be new and novel. It seems to me that the whole argument for them is that other methods were not successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the general argument, and it is clear that hon. Members opposite play up far too much this business about public enterprise in the Highlands. Most people do not mind who provides them with jobs, so long as they get jobs. I have not found many people who say to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>601</span>
themselves, "I shall not work here because it is owned publicly". This applies to very good Conservatives, too. They are just as keen on working in public enterprise as anyone else. There are a few people who prefer to live as entrepreneurs, and they are very valuable men in their sphere, but I am talking about ordinary people. If we can provide employment for those who are at present leaving the Highlands they will not worry whether it is being provided by a firm set up and run publicly or privately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the Board should be given these powers, because experience has already indicated that they are necessary. The case of Brora Colliery has been mentioned. Here the Highland Fund took over the colliery until an arrangement could be made under which the people who were working in it could own and run it. Somebody had to take it over in the meantime. Surely that sort of power can be useful in other spheres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For quite good reasons an industry owned and run by a certain person might be in difficulties. The owner might think it desirable to close the factory down, or get rid of it. He might not be able to get rid of it on the market, in which case he might say, "All right. I will close it down and do the best I can". Surely, in such a case the Board could say, "It would be a tragedy if this happened. Over the years this has proved to be a viable industry. In the meanwhile we had better take it over and see what arrangements can be made to keep it going". Not to give the Board these powers would be failing to recognise the need for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Board will do, and that is a practical example. One could think of similar examples. In the case of setting up a small industry it might be that as a result of various activities in the Highlands—research of various kinds—it was found valuable to exploit certain mineral deposits or to do certain other things. If the Board felt that these were desirable things to do in the interests of the area—not only economically but socially—it could arrange to see that they were carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that the Board has a social as well as an economic obligation; it has an obligation to develop an area in the widest sense. That is something that is not taken into consideration
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>602</span>
by private enterprise. In assessing the possibility of undertaking a certain project, the Board has to take into account these wider considerations. Private enterprise would merely ask if there would be a return of 8 per cent. or 10 per cent., or whatever it felt necessary, and if the project did not seem likely to yield that amount of profit private enterprise would not be interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitude of the Board would be quite different. It might feel it quite useful to develop an industry which would not show a profit for some time but which would nevertheless be of importance to the area, if other work was being carried out to develop that area. It might be thought desirable to provide additional employment, and the Board should have the necessary powers. That is not asking too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industry is important in the Highlands and in all rural areas. Surveys carried out in certain areas show that no matter to what extent natural resources are developed, those areas will never regain their former populations because increasingly higher standards of living are being demanded all the time, and as society progresses it is found that the only way to maintain the population levels in these areas is to bring in ancillary industries which are not native to those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why it is necessary for the Board to be able to establish industries. No hon. Member would think that we could make a success of the highlands unless industry could be brought in. The aim is to provide a second job, or even, in many cases, the only job, in order to prevent a young person on leaving school having to go out of the area to obtain employment. We believe that in fulfilling these functions the Board will have to do some of the things that I have indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing methods of providing employment will also be maintained. B.O.T.A.C. will still be operating in the Highlands, and the grants available under it will still be available. The Board of Trade will try to attract new industry to the area. All this work will continue, but the Highland Board will be doing something additional. We visualise that these financial powers will enable it to do more to help industry than can be done by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>603</span>
B.O.T.A.C., because this form of assistance will be different and over a wider area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked to assure the Committee, on the one hand, that we would not use these powers, and, on the other, that we would. It is not for me to give assurances; the Board will decide what to recommend. But if the Board is a responsible body—and there is no reason to doubt that it will be—it will not embark on all sorts of ventures which are likely to prove failures, or undertake work which other people are doing well. There will be plenty for the Board to do without its running into every kind of unnecessary difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite have visualised the Board's trying to undermine businesses, but if the Board acted in this way what do they think would be its standing in the Highlands? The Board cannot be successful unless it has the good will of the Highland people, and the best way to lose it would be to do some of the things which hon. Members opposite have suggested it will do. I imagine that the Board will use its powers for the purposes which I have indicated. They might not be used a great deal at the beginning, but a scheme might come along in respect of which those powers would have to be used. It is a matter for the Board, and the character of the schemes which are put forward. I am sure that the Board will realise that it has these powers and will apply them where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the answers to the many fears expressed by hon. Members opposite, including the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell), lies in the fact that the Secretary of State and the Treasury must approve recommendations. It is therefore almost a question of Government approval. It becomes a question of Government policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that it is up to the Board to decide what to do—but it is not entirely up to the Board, because the Secretary of State must approve. Therefore, there are certain assurances which the Minister can give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The initiatives are with the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>604</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the decision is with the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision whether to approve remains with the Government. We shall have to see what is the nature of a proposal before deciding whether it should be endorsed or approved. If a scheme is necessary for the development of the Highlands, and the work involved is not being done satisfactorily or efficiently by somebody else, and there is no possibility of its being done efficiently, the scheme will doubtless go forward. I visualise that in most cases the Board will get other people to do the work, on an agency basis, although it has the power to carry it out directly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend assure us that the Government will not be a sort of benevolent shadow continually behind the Board, but will, within certain limits, have freedom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly the Board will have freedom to initiate these proposals and place them before the Minister. As for assisting industry by way of grant, that power comes under another part of the Bill, and there will not have to be constant resort to the Secretary of State. In the case of a business that is being taken over or started, however, considerable sums of money may be involved. Do not let us beat about the bush. In such a case it is only right that if these schemes are to be fitted into an overall national plan they should be approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury. I should have thought that this was a safeguard against abuse. That is why I think it would be wrong to delete the reference to the Treasury. These are safeguards, and I do not think that the powers will be abused.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn raised one or two specific points, to which I will give him a quick answer. He asked, first, whether any business, of whatever kind, would come within the scope of the Board's powers under the Clause. The answer is "Yes". He went on to ask, does it permit the Board to
	<br><q><p>"acquire or set up and carry on … any business or undertaking"</p></q>
in any part of Scotland or the United Kingdom? The exercise of the powers is not, in terms, restricted to the area of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>605</span>
Highlands and Islands, and since acquisition is necessarily by agreement, the Board could exercise the power anywhere in Scotland and, indeed, south of the Border. Such exercise of the power would, of course, have to fulfil the statutory requirement that the particular action was in pursuance of the Board's general function, that it was for the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands and that it was exercised in relation to the Highlands and Islands. Any such act would require the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain examples which come to mind of where the powers might be used. There would not be many. The powers might be used where a business to be acquired, although located and operated within the Highlands and Islands was, in fact, registered outside the area. There is also the example of where the Board received a gift of a business undertaking outside the Highlands for the benefit of the Highlands and Islands, and it was desirable to keep the business in operation for that purpose, or even temporarily till it could be disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again it might be where the operation of a business centred in the Highlands required some part of its operation to be undertaken outside the boundary of the Highlands and Islands. One may think of industries of that kind. It might also be where the Board might find it necessary to run an advertising or publicity business outside the Highlands for the benefit of the Highlands. These are all cases which explain the reason for these powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how frequently the powers were to be used. That I cannot say, because the initiative rests with the Board, and to a very great extent it depends on the type of work and schemes that the Board is bringing forward. I hope that hon. Members will not think I am trying to dodge the issue. I have endeavoured to indicate the kind of thing that I hope the Board would do but clearly at this stage one cannot say what the Board will do. I have also tried to indicate the kind of circumstances in which I think the powers would be necessary and would be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered most of the points raised and I do not wish to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>606</span>
prolong the argument. Clearly this is an issue which divides the Committee. Hon. Members opposite think it would be a bad thing to give these powers to the Board. We think it would be desirable that the Board should be given the powers, if it is to do the job that we expect it to do, and so I ask the Committee to support the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on a subject which, as the Minister of State has said divides the Committee. I should like to make a few points, I hope fairly shortly, to explain to him and to anyone else who is in doubt what the position is as we on this side of the Committee see it, as the Clause in its present form makes it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides have asked for assurances from the Minister—as he explained, putting him to some slight embarrassment, because the assurances were opposite and unequal. I should like to make a point to the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston). I will not follow him in his rumbustious tirade against individuals not of the same party as himself. There is an important distinction between any assurance which a Minister gives in Committee or in the House and what is written into a Bill. It is that such an assurance has no validity in law. We have experienced cases where this has been shown and I have one case in particular in mind. I will not go into details because it was on a subject different from Highland development although rather closely linked. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave an assurance, and ever since we have had great difficulty because the Inland Revenue quite properly says the assurance was not included in the legislation and therefore it means nothing. Therefore let us not be confused over assurances given by a Minister but not written into a Clause which contains clear indications of the power a Minister may have. They have no real validity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has indicated that in his view by "acquiring" this Clause means acquiring by agreement. As I think my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentland (Mr. Wylie) would agree, if one has power to obtain land by requisition, the land includes the buildings. Once the land and buildings are acquired the only thing left which cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>607</span>
be acquired is goodwill and then agreement is almost certain to be by 	<i>force majeur</i> because there is no alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is happening all the time in city redevelopment. Local authorities do it constantly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but under the planning Acts, as the Minister will agree, local authorities do not have power to set up in business for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that triangular way I think we have cleared up the point and we may, perhaps, proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then went on to say that our arguments, about what might happen if these powers were used, were unreal. This has been clearly shown not to be so because of the very problem which faced the Minister due to the assurances he was asked to give by his hon. Friend behind him. I shall say a word more about that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone who knows the Highlands—and those hon. Members in this Committee who did not will know more now, for they have had a fair breath of wind from them—will realise that there is a great deal being done and a great deal which has been done by public enterprise in the Highlands in one form or another. I need not enumerate these activities. The Minister asked where would the Highlands be now but for public money which has been expended, and it is true that this money has been expended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did a little research into the affairs of an estate which I know about and I found that over the last fifty or sixty years, certainly up until the last war, infinitely more private money was paid out for the development of that estate and for the employment of people—the employment was greater then—than has been paid out in total in all forms of grants and assistance by Government services. This is inevitable. Just as the hon. Gentleman rightly said that the rapidly increasing standard of living which the public expect in other parts of the country acts as a magnet and causes depopulation, so a period of very high taxation—in certain cases almost confiscatory in character—inevitably means
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>608</span>
that if things are to be done, it is only the State which can afford to do them. This is particularly true in the social field. I agree broadly with the Minister and I will not make the small points which I could make. Broadly speaking, what the people in the Highlands want is jobs, and they do not care too much whether the jobs are provided by public or private enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a slightly forlorn hope on the part of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) that the Minister would unbosom himself of his ideas about development. A tiny corner of the veil was lifted. We had the Brora colliery which is an example of how the former Member of Parliament for Caithness and Sutherland, stepped in and set up a small co-operative business, and made what was a marginal colliery financially successful when the Coal Board, the nationalised industry, was not prepared to touch it. This may be an indication of what may be done by co-operative private enterprise which cannot be done by a nationalised concern, but I do not want to make party points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain natural resources in the Highlands which could be developed and certainly far more of them could be developed if economics could be ignored—though I disagree with the hon. Gentleman when he says that private enterprise does not take social considerations into account, because it certainly does. I am perfectly certain we should never have got the pulp mill at Fort William had it not been for Mr. Frankel's real interest in the social development of the Highland area, and that was one of the driving factors behind that enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there are people who have a genuine interest and want to do something for the area. These people frequently try to get something done. I simply made the criticism that private enterprise does not have to take social considerations into account to any extent; it is concerned with profit. I do not criticise that. It is the purpose and function of private enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that the hon. Gentleman is right there, because private enterprise in most cases has to maintain the good will of its shareholders and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>609</span>
other people, and to be efficient and to make a profit is often the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagreed with the hon. Gentleman when he said in his last words that what the Board will do—this is why he did not like to commit himself to giving examples—will depend on its own initiative. It does to some extent. It also depends on the extent to which the Secretary of State—who has powers under earlier Clauses—directs the Board as to what it should do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State cannot give specific directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He can give general instructions. The dividing line between the general and the specific could provide this Committee with an argument which would go on for much longer than I intend to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness said, quite rightly, that the existing powers of the Secretary of State were very wide. They are, but they are not nearly as wide as this Clause would make them in the event of its passing into law. It is interesting—it may be comforting, perhaps, to some, and embarrassing to others—that so far as I can recollect over the last fifteen or twenty years the compulsory powers of the Secretary of State to acquire land in the Highlands, either directly for his own purposes, or through the Forestry Commission, have practically never if ever been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) was charmingly frank, as he always is with the Committee, and said plainly and straightforwardly that he wanted to destroy the landlords. This is an acceptable doctrine on his part and in his constituency, I am quite sure, and I have noticed a similar approach, though rather less frank, sometimes, by the Liberal Party to the Highlands, though it never comes out as clearly as that; it does it by innuendo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the last thirty to thirty-five years, as I have seen, not only in this country but particularly in Europe, has indicated a willingness from time to time—because of bad conditions which have arisen in countries for one reason or another—for democracies to give powers to their Governments in this form—very wide powers—having been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>610</span>
given assurances by the Governments that of course the powers would be used only in most reasonable and sensible ways. I am sure that in those countries, too, people made speeches like the speech made today by the hon. Member for Fife, West, saying that there was nothing to worry about regarding the powers, because the State Secretary was answerable to Parliament. It is exactly because the parliamentary democracies in other countries have not watched the extension of Government control over the liberties of the subject—and one can consider Italy, Germany and, perhaps, France today—that there has been the passing of democracy into the hands of authoritarian Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, the duty of the Opposition, in cases of this sort, to look very carefully indeed at the powers which the Government are claiming they need for a specific purpose—whether it is to destroy landlords or something else—and which in the view of the Opposition is wrong. We must consider what the powers can do and what can be done under them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be remembered that it is not only the landlords against whom these powers could be used. They could be used against any hotel keeper, business proprietor, garage owner, owner-occupier of a farm or anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only by agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not say they would be, but the point is powers in this Clause are taken to deal with them if the Government wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says "by agreement". I must refer to the point I made earlier, that if the land and buildings are taken over, one is left with nothing but the goodwill. Left only with that, one will probably agree to sell it because, after all, one cannot operate the goodwill if the factory, land, hotel, farm, garage or whatever it might be has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, these powers are exceedingly wide. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands asked the hon. Member for the Western Isles
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) in an intervention whether he knew of any other single case in which powers of this sort had been taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The New Towns Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is only one. The hon. Member for Fife, West asked specifically that the Board should be given powers equivalent to those of other statutory bodies. It should be remembered that the new towns have powers strictly limited in area and scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are very wide powers indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are very wide powers but they are limited to specific purposes in a specified small area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, these powers will apply not only to the Highlands but also to the rest of Scotland and, indeed, to England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend not agree that under the New Towns Act there is no power to acquire a business but that such powers as there are are for such things as the carrying on of businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend, who keeps the Committee right on these rather tricky technical points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the point we were arguing about on an Amendment, when we on this side wanted to confine these sorts of activities of the Board to the Highland areas or other areas designated as being in the same category. It is perfectly true—we thought that it was, and the Minister has kindly confirmed that it is—that it would, for example, be possible for the Board to decide to set up a business in the Highlands and that if it were decided that the necessary bits and pieces for it could be more cheaply made in Birmingham or elsewhere, the Board could acquire a business there to make the parts, send them to, say, a motor business which the Board in Inverness or a steel works set up at Raasay—although I would rather say Tyree, where there is an even better supply of iron ore. I mention that because we seem to be coming to our own constituency potentials. The hon. Gentleman, I think, said that that would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>612</span>
be a good thing. Perhaps economically a good thing, yes; but what the Highlands want from the Bill is industry in the Highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps when the Minister reconsiders the Clause, if the Committee decides that it should stand part of the Bill, he will look at this point again to see whether these powers should be confined to the Highland areas or the areas adjacent to them, for the reasons my hon. Friends and I have adduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate on this subject. Hon. Members have mentioned their constituencies regularly; they have expressed their parties' fervour or lack of fervour for nationalisation in its various forms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman continues, and returning to the subject about which he was speaking a moment ago, has he noted the powers of the White Fish Authority under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951? Section 4(1) of that Act states that the Authority has power
	<br><q><p>"… to promote the export of white fish by establishing, or by encouraging and giving financial or other assistance for the establishment of, selling agencies and storage facilities outside the United Kingdom …</p></q>"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but those powers are confined to the narrow functions of the White Fish Authority, and the point here is that we are here dealing with powers to do anything in connection with any business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the powers in the Bill are related to the functions of the Highland Development Board in the same way as the powers in the Sea Fish Industry Act are related to the functions of the White Fish Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To bring the debate to a conclusion, we have expressed our views and thoughts and there is, to my mind, one overriding factor in the Clause as it stands, and that is that it gives the Secretary of State, the Treasury, the Board power to do practically anything which one can imagine in any part of the United Kingdom. I suggest that these powers are much too wide and that a great deal of further thought should be given to them by the Government. They are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V004P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>613</span>
certainly much too wide to be acceptable to us on this side. They represent an enormous extention of any powers which any Government have asked for for any purpose in this country and we must, therefore, oppose the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the desire to conclude our proceedings on the Clause this morning and I assure my hon. Friend the Minister of State and the Committee that I will do nothing to prevent that happening. I am sure that I speak on behalf of this side of the Committee when I say how much I applaud the stand which the Minister has taken on the Clause. It is absolutely essential that the Board is able to proceed along the lines made possible by the Clause. If my hon. Friend looks ahead, as I am sure he has, he will find that there are other Clauses which we have not yet discussed which are also important and on which, I hope, that he will take an equally firm stand.

	<div class='title'>Clause 7. (ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 105, in page 4, line 32, to leave out "other".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient for the Committee to discuss, with this Amendment, Amendment No. 106, in line 34, leave out "commercial and other" and insert "and commercial".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that suggestion, Mr. Steele, because it is appropriate for both Amendments to be discussed together.

The Clause contains certain very useful provisions in regard to advisory functions in paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> and the promotion</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>614</span>
	<p>private enterprise has failed to deal with the problems which face the Highlands today. That proof was supplied on Second Reading and has been clearly shown in our proceedings on this Bill. The party opposite, when in power, failed to prevent the de-population which still continues in the Highlands. When I look at the voters roll in Govan I see more Highland names than will be seen in some of the Highland areas today—proof of what has happened in the past as a result of the policies of the party opposite.</p>
	<p>That is the sort of thing we must stop. If we succeed we will help not only the Highlands but the whole of Scotland. I hope that my hon. Friend will maintain the attitude he has displayed today. I am not out to destroy anything, landlordism or anything else. I am out to supplant it with something better.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 13, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>of publicity in paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> However, in paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> the Board is empowered
	<br><q><p>"to engage in such other activity as the Board may deem expedient …"</p></q></p>
	<p>We are thrown back again to what seems to me to be the easy route which the draftsman of the Bill has invariably taken when he wants to be sure that he has covered everything. He just uses a provision of this nature.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All draftsmen do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said that the Government have invariably taken the easy way out when they have been unable to think of an example of the exercise of the powers involved. They merely say that it might be necessary or that they may need a wide provision of this nature.

Amendment No. 105 is partly probing. It is probing to find out the other activities which the Government have in mind. By seeking the deletion of the words "commercial and other" before "enterprises" in Amendment No. 106 we are probing to find out what are the other enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, it seems to me, because paragraph 	<i>(c)</i> must be read in connection with paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b),</i> that one should not have to go to other Clauses to deduce what the Government have in</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>616</span>
	<p>mind. One is tempted to ask, If it is not the kind of advice referred to in paragraph 	<i>(a),</i> and if it is not publicity, as referred to in paragraph 	<i>(b),</i> what are the other activities which the Board will be engaged upon, and are they not already adequately covered by the wide terms already used in the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<i>It being One o'clock,</i> The CHAIRMAN 	<i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Committee adjourned till Tuesday, 11th May, 1965, at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
