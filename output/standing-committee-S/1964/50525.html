	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Brewis. I wish to move, That this Committee do now adjourn, to meet one week hence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for this is that last Thursday when I was summoned to attend this Committee I went to the Vote Office and I was given this copy of the Bill which has this very curious note of amendment stuck on it—a very shoddy bit of work, I may say. The point is this. I rang up Edinburgh Corporation because I wanted its views on the Bill and I discovered that the Corporation had an original copy of the Bill with no amendment at all. This was last Thursday. It was not possible for me to visit the Corporation on Friday; the Town Clerk was not there on Saturday; and I had to be here on Monday. Other hon. Members may have been placed in the same position, wanting information from their local authorities and not being able to get it because the Bill was not complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know why it was not complete. It may have been a printers error—but the printers are probably very busy printing unwanted Bills. But I do blame Ministers for not reading their Bills. There is a quite considerable difference here, a matter of nearly half a million pounds. I do not see why we should be asked to make up our minds on this faulty information. For these reasons I ask for one week's delay so that the matter may be gone into further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I can accept the hon. Member's Motion. The fault is a small printing error in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, which is not part of the Bill, and we have had the correction in our possession for at least a week. For these reasons I cannot accept the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. William Ross)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House, that the Housing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill has been considered in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></q>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) was put to inconvenience because the printers missed out a nought. I am sure that if he had turned over the page, and departed from the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum and read the Bill itself, he would have been put quite at ease as to the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very simple and straightforward Bill. It deals with the single purpose of raising by £10 million the aggregate amount of advances which may be made from the Consolidated Fund to the Scottish Special Housing Association for the purpose of building houses in Scotland. The S.S.H.A. is a wholly Exchequer-financed body. It relies on these advances for all its capital expenditure. The amount of work which it can undertake is dependent on the extent to which it can draw advances from the Consolidated Fund. This is the reason for the Bill, to raise by £10 million the advances open to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statutory limit to the advances was first made in 1955 when the limit of £75 million was placed on its finances by Section 16 of the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act, 1955. In 1957 this limit was raised to £100 million by Section 23 of the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act—of sacred memory. In 1962 this was raised still further to £110 million by Section 18 of the Housing (Scotland) Act of that year. The position is that up to the financial year 1964-65 the actual advances which have been made to the Association have reached about £101-4 million. By the end of March the amount committed was about £106 million. It stands to reason that if we go on approving houses in respect of the S.S.H.A., it will mean that by the end of the year we shall be dangerously near the actual limit of £110 million. We are, therefore, seeking Parliamentary authority for raising the limit by an additional £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that anyone would want to see the forward planning of the Scottish Special Housing Association inhibited

in any way, or its building work curtailed. The Association has been and is a valuable instrument for house building in Scotland in particular circumstances. It was started in 1937 before the last war at a time when unemployment was pretty bad in Scotland, and it was an instrument placed at the disposal of the Commissioner for the Scottish Special Areas—Scotland was then a distressed area—for the purposes of enabling houses to be built; for slum clearance purposes; and to deal with overcrowding in outlying areas where it was difficult to get contractors. It was part of the economic build-up of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The war came before the Association had really got going but by that time it had built about 1,714 houses. After the war, when there was an urgent need for getting on speedily with the building of houses, it was taken over by the Secretary of State for Scotland and since that time has been at the disposal of the Secretary of State in respect of house building. The amount of work it has done since 1937 may be judged by the fact that it is now the owner of 60,000 houses. Outside Glasgow, it is the largest owner of houses in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to ensure that its work shall go on, we wish to secure that it shall be uninhibited by the closeness of the financial limit by the end of the year. Since the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957, the activities of the Association have been steadily curtailed. There was a basic change of task. It was given the special job, under that Act, of dealing with the Glasgow overspill, building in the reception areas, or arranging for building, for the families over-spilled from Glasgow into those areas. Secondly, it could give direct assistance to local authorities who needed houses built urgently when the financial burden would have been construed as being unreasonable in respect of their rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overspill building has not gone as well as was originally hoped, but nearly 6,000 houses have been provided—5,887—and 3,172 were built by the S.S.H.A. on its own behalf. The Association not only builds on its own behalf but is the agent of local authorities and builds for local authorities as well. It has done valuable work in relation to site preparation and layout design. This can be seen in some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
of the towns which have been handling the overspill developments, such as Irvine, Whitburn and Kirkintilloch. Other areas have enjoyed the benefit of the experience built up by the Association, which has been an advantage not only to those areas but to Scotland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1964, and under the Housing Act of that year, the Association was given yet another task, which, to a certain extent, it had been doing, of making provision for key workers. It was given the statutory task of building to meet the urgent needs of industry in respect of housing for workers brought into areas for key purposes. It demonstrated what could be done at Linwood and Bathgate where nearly 2,000 houses were built pretty quickly to meet an urgent need. It is doing the same thing in relation to the pulp mill at Fort William at present, where it is undertaking the building of 150 houses to meet the need there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will appreciate how essential is the Association where there is a need for building houses in an area which, from its own point of view and its own local authority needs, has not been able to build up the kind of organisation required. Here we have an organisation which can be switched from one part of Scotland to another to do these special jobs. I think it is something in relation to what we want to see in Scotland spreading out from the centre, and this organisation will prove a valuable instrument in that respect. Of the 60,000 houses which the Association owns it manages two-thirds and acts as agent in respect of local authorities in the areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from this work it has from the start had another function, which was to experiment in relation to the use of building materials. It has carried out, and has developed over quite a number of years, the "no fines" system of concrete building. It is working on industrial methods in relation to multistorey flats for an experimental block in Glasgow. The application of these industrialised methods to two-storey construction has not gone so well, but in the Dumbarton area the Association is putting up some experimental blocks on the basis of development which has been furthered south of the Border by the

Ministry of Housing Development Group. We are trying it out to see whether it could be an advantage to us in our search for speedy and easy building methods in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial effect of the Bill—I am sure that this will be of interest to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South—is that the capital expenditure authorised by the Bill is covered by advances from the Consolidated Fund and does not directly affect the Scottish Housing Vote. It is possible for there to be an indirect effect and this was the point about the missing nought. It is referred to in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. It is impossible to estimate precisely what this will amount to because it is not possible to forecast at this stage the precise rate of expenditure of the additional £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional charge on the housing Vote arises under two heads. In the first place, all the houses which the Association builds attract subsidy under Section 1 of the 1962 Act at a standard rate of £42 per annum. The Association also receives the additional subsidies under the 1962 Act where these are appropriate, for example, for multistorey flats and for schemes involving special precautions because of subsidence and the like. In the second place the Association receives an additional payment from the housing Vote under Section 19 of the 1962 Act. This is to make good the deficit on its operations after taking into account the income from the rents and subsidies and the outgoings on repairs, management and loan charges. The payment is, therefore, the counterpart of the rate contribution made by a local authority to its housing revenue account and has to be met by the Exchequer, since the Association has no rating resources. The amount of this additional payment is even more difficult to estimate than the subsidies. As the Memorandum says, the ultimate burden on the housing Vote to cover both these elements might be of the order of £500,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will appreciate that although this is a simple and straightforward Bill it is, from the point of view of Scotland, an important Bill. It ensures that, probably for at least two to two-and-a-half years, building by the Association will carry on at its present
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
rate. I sincerely hope that it will increase. The fact that we had to come earlier to the House than was envisaged when the last Act went through in 1962 for a further extension of the limit shows the extent to which the S.S.H.A. has been used to meet urgent housing needs in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) I might perhaps refer to this Bill as the Housing (Amendment) (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill. It is, as the Secretary of State has said, designed to extend the limit of advances which may be made by the Government to the Scottish Special Housing Association to £120 million, a further £10 million. This limit was set in 1962 and I am sure that hon. Members on this side of the Committee would not wish to oppose the extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State has described, the Scottish Special Housing Association has grown, especially since the war, and its activities have become more varied. In the past two or three years it has entered into at least one new field, and it is, therefore, a natural consequence that the limit for advances set three years ago should now need to be extended. Can the Secretary of State assure us that the resources of the S.S.H.A. will be fully occupied in the next year or so in view of the credit squeeze? We quite see that in the long term this extension is necessary, but will the S.S.H.A. be fully employed in the next year or two because it has resources and a direct labour organisation and a great deal of experience?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of building houses has risen. It has been calculated that within the last seven months the new increases in taxation and the surcharge have meant that the cost of building an average house has gone up by about £100. This must add to the bill facing the S.S.H.A. and other in building houses. On the various functions of the S.S.H.A. and the fields in which it operates, as the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, since 1944 the Association can build in any district designated in Scotland by the Government. Besides building it has been given permission also to go in for conversions and improvements with certain financial limits, and a special
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
task placed on it has been that of building for local authorities and Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the figure which the Secretary of State gave of the houses in ownership. It has reached 60,000. We could see from the last report that it was over 58,000, so we knew that it must now be about that figure. The management of two-thirds of these is itself a major task for a body of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Will he give the Committee his method of calculation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been estimated by builders, who state that the average house costs £100 more to build owing to the surcharge on materials and additional transport costs and other aspects of taxation in the Budget of last October.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying when interrupted on a point I had made minutes before, perhaps the most important task in which the S.S.H.A. has been engaged is the tremendously important share of its help for Glasgow in the rebuilding necessary there because of the tremendous density of population in the Glasgow area. Besides experimenting in new types of flats in high building, it has, as the Secretary of State mentioned, been assisting with the overspill problems by building in reception areas. This will continue to be a major task, and I assume that the S.S.H.A. will continue to have this as one of its main operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that in particular the S.S.H.A. has been looking into new methods of industrialised building. I was able last year to look at some of these buildings, when they were still in various stages of construction, on two of the Glasgow building sites. I should be grateful if the Secretary of State could tell us about any of the latest reports on the success of these new methods or any difficulties that have been met. This is a useful function for the S.S.H.A. provided it does not hold up house building. I note also that it has been using building methods with system-building components which have themselves been constructed in Scotland. This is something which we on this side of the Committee would encourage. In the White Paper on Central Scotland two years ago it was stated that the S.S.H.A. would help in the extra building required in the growth areas and that its activities would be expanded in this way. This again is a reason for the extension of the limit to the advances which is the subject of this Bill. This was to be expected, and I hope the Secretary of State can tell us that this expansion is taking place and that the S.S.H.A. is being able to play the part foreseen for it in the growth areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Secretary of State mentioned the pulp mill building operations. He said that there were 150 houses being built there. Can he tell us the latest position, whether they are almost completed or how many are completed? Because my understanding is that the mill should start to be in operation by the end of this year, if not earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1964 Housing Act gave the S.S.H.A. yet another task, to act as agent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
in Scotland for the new Housing Corporation. Under Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 of that Act the Housing Corporation was to provide land for housing societies which were to meet the requirement of providing homes for cost renting and also co-ownership. I wonder whether there is any activity yet in this new field about which the Secretary of State could tell us. It is the Association's most recent new task, because that Act received the Royal Assent only late last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting point in the latest Report of the S.S.H.A. is that it has built 110 houses for the Board of Trade, for letting to managers of industrial estates, and that the Association has decided to sell those houses as they became vacant or to sitting tenants. It was stated in the Report that 64 of those had been sold. Therefore, although the vast majority of the houses which the Association builds are for letting and it continues to own them in those cases, the question of building houses for sale has come up. This touches on the shortage of houses for sale in Scotland, as opposed to houses for rent. There is in Scotland, as we all know, a tradition of building houses for letting, but with the rise in the standards of living in the country generally, and with the new enthusiasm for home ownership, it is clear that we must be ready for changes in which more and more people will want to own their own homes. While recognising the great work which the Association is doing and the encouragement which the last Government gave and, we hope, this Government is giving to it, we must at the same time make it clear that it is important to encourage private building also in Scotland. Only one-third of the houses each year being built in Scotland are built for private ownership, and this is the normal method of providing homes for people to own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has an important effect on industrial development in Scotland because, as is demonstrated by these 110 houses, many of the key persons who have to move to Scotland with industry, if industry is setting up in Scotland, find it difficult to acquire the houses they want. Managers and other personnel want to own the houses themselves, and I am sure that if the Secretary of State has visited some of the firms which have recently set up in Scotland he will have been told
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
that this is one of their difficulties. Very often the need for the supply of electric power or many thousand gallons of water an hour can be met and so can the need for communications, but one of their difficulties is that key personnel whom they have brought with them cannot find the houses they want and are discouraged thereby from going to Scotland. Their wives are deterred also. This is a great pity. It is important from this industrial point of view, and, for new industry moving to Scotland, that we should present a picture not only of good authority housing and S.S.H.A. housing but also of houses of various kinds, of great variety, which can be bought. This will make Scotland more attractive to brains and skill and will have its effect in discouraging brains and skill from going South, as well as attracting key personnel North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad there is no argument about this from the other side of the Committee. I was interested in what the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said in the debate in the Committee of the whole House on 29th April. He started his speech by saying:
	<br><q><p>"It is because I share many of the sentiments expressed by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Boyd-Carpenter) about the desirability of home ownership, a sentiment which is shared by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 29th April, 1965; Vol. 711, c. 697.]</p></q>
I think I can speak for all my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee today in saying that we wish the S.S.H.A. well in its programmes and we hope its resources and experience can be fully used in the immediate future. We therefore support this Bill as a consequence of the programmes on which the S.S.H.A. is already embarked. At the same time we also would support the Government in anything that they do in helping to create conditions for more house building as a whole, including private building, which can best provide for home ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very interesting historical review from my right hon. Friend, and also from the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) who in the process took full advantage of the opportunity to give us

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
the Conservative Party's policy on housing, but may I appeal to my right hon. Friend, on behalf, I hope, of most of us who are supporting this Bill, to take steps to try to get across to the country that there is now going to be a change of attitude and outlook so far as the Scottish Special Housing Association is concerned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too often in the past—and it is understandable—it has been used as a direct weapon of the Government of the day to reduce housing standards, to reduce standards of accommodation, and certainly to influence local authorities in their attitude to rents. We are not objecting to this. As I say, it is understandable that any Government should use a Government agency to achieve certain purposes, but undoubtedly, in the minds of far too many people in Scotland, including responsible members of local authorities, S.S.H.A. houses have always been regarded, unfortunately, as inferior houses, and I would like my right hon. Friend to take this opportunity of showing to the country that he is determined that the agency should be used not just for producing houses in quantity but also for improving the quality of what one loosely describes as local authority housing. I think this is vitally important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt about it that in the past the S.S.H.A. was the first to conform with reduced ceiling heights, with all sorts of technical and medical arguments as to how this did not affect the standard of accommodation being provided. In fact, behind it all was always the attempt to reduce the cost of building at the expense of the consumer. This was typical of the approach which was made, and unfortunately, the reputation earned by the S.S.H.A. was due to Government pressure to reduce quality. So in supporting this Bill I would hope that my right hon. Friend can give us the assurance that while undoubtedly there is need for experimentation in types of building and new processes and so on it will not be unduly at the expense of quality and amenity and landscaping and layout which I think only now is the S.S.H.A. beginning to acquire in Scotland. I think it is an excellent team now, particularly on the architectural side, and I would like to see us, as a Government, with a new outlook, being able to show the people of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Glasgow and Scotland that there is to be a new outlook regarding the quality and standard of amenity of the houses which we shall have as a result of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In most parts of Scotland there is no agency for building houses at the moment apart from the local authorities, and that is the reason why this Bill is very important indeed. This amendment to the 1962 Act is to increase the amount allocated to the Scottish Special Housing Association. The present limit is £110 million, and this is to be advanced to £120 million. This in itself is an indication of the demand there is for the services provided by this Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know to what extent this Association is operating with local authorities at present, that is, in areas where there is a special need for housing and in areas away from the main industrial centres. Can, for instance, the local authority invite the Association to come into an area where there is special need for housing? Reference has been made to the pulp mill, and we are glad to know the Association is helping in this respect. This is an important development in the north. I do not know how this arrangement has been brought about between the Government and the pulp mill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with this particular Association, but I understand it is possible to set up similar associations elsewhere. This, I think, should be more widely known, because it would seem there is to be a greater need for this type of housing in the future. Can any similar association which is set up provide houses for development or for incoming industry? I refer particularly to the Highlands of Scotland. We know, or we expect, that there will be considerable demand for houses after the Highland Development Board is set up, and it would seem to me an association of this type would be in a better position to provide houses on a large scale than the local authority with its very limited means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the housing of old people. I know that in many areas at the moment old people are occupying houses which are much beyond their requirements, and if there were a possibility of building houses for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
them, that would be an opportunity to release houses for people with families to move to the area. These are points which, to my mind, are very important indeed, and I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman could deal with them when he replies to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill is an interesting experience for me as a Member of Parliament. In my right hon. Friend's statement on the provisions of this Bill he mentioned many of the facets of house building, but he did not mention the question of improvement schemes. I understand that this question of improvement schemes is a very important part of the work of the S.S.H.A. How many improvement schemes are in being I am not quite sure, but I know of one in my Constituency, Rosyth, which is causing a great deal of concern to the tenants, who consider it to be a very inadequate scheme. It is felt that some of the money which is to be advanced to the S.S.H.A. should go towards improvement schemes, and particularly the one in my Constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has mentioned that there are 60,000 houses under the responsibility of the S.S.H.A., but I do not think that he has mentioned the nature of the standard of those houses. They are not all of a very high standard. The improvement scheme I have in mind in Rosyth deals with houses, a little more than 1,000, which were built in 1914, so the condition of the houses at this time can be imagined. There are 19 different designs in this housing scheme, and we know it is very difficult to bring forward a standardised improvement design. I could go on at great length telling the Committee why people are concerned about the improvement scheme. It entails a great deal of expense and discomfort when they have to move, and the main complaint is that when the houses are improved they are, in my opinion, substandard and do not conform to modern requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that instead of the limit being £120 million it should be much greater. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) has asked whether resources will be fully occupied during the next few years. I am sure they could be fully occupied if they were concentrated more on improvement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
schemes and bringing houses up to modern standards. I am not quite sure what the Secretary of State's powers of remit are regarding the S.S.H.A., but I am quite sure he should take cognisance of the points I have made this morning. I very much welcome the Bill, but I would welcome it even more if there had been some statement by my right hon. Friend that more money would be concentrated on improvement schemes in the older type of houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said in introducing it, this is a very small Bill and it was obvious there would not be a great deal of discussion on the terms, but it was fair for the Members of the Committee to expect from the Secretary of State some indication of the direction of Government policy towards the S.S.H.A. What is the extra money to be used for, and will policies be the same as in the past? We did not get this, but we had what the hon. Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) described as an historical review, and we have heard of the greatly increased powers and responsibilities which the previous Government gave to the Association. We have rather a complacent Bill with no indication of the direction of Government policy and of the role the S.S.H.A. is to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that there is a need for some indication of the Government's policy for housing in Scotland, especially at the present time when the building industry is facing a serious crisis and when it is necessary to know what part the Government expect the S.S.H.A. to play in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> of 25th April there was an indication of substantial pay-offs in the building industry, an indication that the housing target for this year would be 12½ per cent. short of the original target. I would like some advice as to whether the target in Scotland will fall equally short, and whether there is any policy to make that up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is important for Glasgow. Of the 50,000 houses which the S.S.H.A. has built since 1948, 5,000 have been built in Glasgow, a great many in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, since 1948. These figures were taken from a facts and figures publication by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1964. It was indicated that 5,000 were built in Glasgow, quite apart from the contribution made through overspill to the city's housing needs. If there is a need for an indication of direction of policy, surely there should be an indication in particular about the needs of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see from the Annual Report of the Association and other documents which I have read, the broad responsibilities of the Scottish Special Housing Association are largely under three heads. First of all we have a contribution in areas where there is special housing need, and it is clear that in Glasgow there is such a special housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there was an indication that it has a responsibility where it is helpful from a financial point of view for the Association to build houses at no cost to the ratepayers of that locality. At present in Glasgow, according to the same book I have here, the indication is that our direct housing deficit will be of the order of £4,750,000, and the estimate arrived at on the basis of interest charges is of round about £8 million. Bearing in mind the substantial increases in interest rates since then, it is clear the deficit will be substantially greater by now. Surely there is need for more effort in Glasgow by the Association? We have to appreciate that there is a great contribution that the Association can make to Glasgow's overspill housing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of interest rates, my memory is that the last Government always insisted that the high interest rates were not met at the moment because they were averaged over the whole period.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that. When the rates were 6 per cent. the average for the city was £4 3s. 7d. When we have a situation in which local authorities are forced to borrow short term at 9 per cent. and to take long-term money costing them 7 per cent., it is clear that this is bringing serious hardship to

a city like Glasgow where the rate burden is already intolerable largely through Government policies and through the failure of the Socialist-controlled council. I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman might well be leading me towards being out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for an additional £10 million in capital expenditure. We have not had an indication from the Secretary of State as to where the direction of his policy is. One indication we have is the figure of £10 million. This seems to me to be quite inadequate in relation to the capital expenditure undertaken by the S.S.H.A. in the past and also in relation to the responsibilities which the previous Government gave to the Association. It was clear that the legislation we passed and the responsibilities we gave to Scottish special housing that we were looking to it greatly to expand its activities in certain directions. We have the indication on this occasion that the capital requirements are to be increased by £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traditionally, the Association plans its housing programmes on the basis of a three-year programme. If the Government have it in mind that this figure of £10 million is related in any way to the figure of three years, it is clear the Government are not thinking in terms of a major expansion of the activities of the Scottish Special Housing Association. When we consider that last year, or the year ended 31st March, 1964, the capital expended by the Association was £7·5 million and when we also consider that by the end of the year we shall have exhausted our limit of £110 million, it is clear that the Bill is looking forward to a year and a half or two years' activity on the part of the Association. Would it not have been wiser and more correct if the Secretary of State had asked for authority for an extra £20 million and at the same time indicated precisely where he was intending to go with his housing policy and what part he expected the Association to play in it? It seems to be only a holding operation. I am concerned indeed that this might be an indication that the Government are in some way restraining the expansion of house building in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the question of capital needs, I was disappointed that the Secretary of State did not indicate that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
was thinking in terms of the Association finding some alternative means of providing capital, apart from a direct grant from the Exchequer. When we consider the point referred to by my hon. Friend about the Association seling 64 houses last year, I think it would be appropriate if the Secretary of State were to indicate whether he is thinking of an expansion of sales of this sort. When the S.S.H.A. moves into a difficult area to meet difficult housing needs and when that area settles down and becomes more prosperous, does the Secretary of State consider that the Government should expand this kind of activity of selling houses in areas which are largely settled and have become more prosperous?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A final point concerns the indications given as to the cost under Section 1 and Section 19 of the Housing Act, 1962. I doubt if this figure will be adequate. I would like the Secretary of State to indicate how he feels that a figure of £500,000 will be appropriate as a long-term objective. Will this be adequate to cope first of all with the larger deficit which must arise from the financial policies of the Government? Last year the Association had a deficit of round about £200,000. It would seem on the basis of such figures as are available and also from the indications of Government financial policies that the deficit will be substantially greater this year. Did the Secretary of State take this into account when arriving at this estimate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does the estimate of £500,000 take enough account of the greatly increased responsibilities which the previous Government had in mind for the Association for financing the activities of housing corporations in Scotland? Under the 1964 Act it was considered that cost rent schemes and co-ownership schemes should be encouraged and financed by the Association. Did the Secretary of State take into acount this activity, and was he considering that this should be restricted in any way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, does this figure take adequate account of the financial grants under the 1962 Act for the ambitious programmes put forward by the previous Government in the growth areas White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, could the Secretary of State indicate the kind of total which he has in mind? When we consider that under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
the 1962 Act a grant of £42 is given to every Association house and an extra £40 for any multistorey house, and when we add up the grants and look at the estimate of £500,000 as a possible objective, it would seem that the Government's housing programme will be substantially less than what the previous Government had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that this Bill envisages the kind of restriction which is part of the general activity which the Government are facing up to at present. We are entitled to more information. I would be much happier if, instead of an extra £10 million, we gave an extra £20 million, and at the same time had a clear indication from the Government as to what their views are about future housing policy and what part they expect the Association to play in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Carmichael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) asked for certain information, quite legitimately, but I think he has introduced an over-partisan note. We can all remember that about eighteen months ago there was a debate on the S.S.H.A., on the Estimates, I think, and there was a reasoned debate on either side, particularly from the then Opposition. I think most of us tried not to make political capital from it. The hon. Member for Cathcart made a very hard type of speech as though he was going to call for a revolution in the whole of Scottish housing, but what it all amounted to was that he would rather have the sum raised from £10 million to £20 million. If £10 million is not going to do a great deal, then I do not think £20 million will do a great deal more to meet the needs of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this Bill, and I am sure it is, is the first of a series of measures which we are going to have from the present Government. This is only one field, and I am sure we will have them in many others, in order to push forward our housing programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Special Housing Association appears to have two reputations, an excellent reputation in the countryside, where it has done extremely good work, and not as good a reputation in the cities, where, as my hon. Friend the Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) suggested, it seems to have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
used as a means of reducing standards and, perhaps, used by the Government even to increase rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I would like to see in the future is the Association being linked in some way with the direct labour departments of some of the local authorities—a large consortium of local authorities plus the Association, which could have some type of loose arrangement, to enable them to link up over such things as industrialised building. I think the most successful thing the Association ever did was when it was building the already prefabricated houses from Sweden and building them particularly in the Highlands and in some of the mining areas where we needed houses quickly. If we could at some point sit down with the Association and the larger local authorities with direct labour departments and get together with the idea of setting out a new plan for a big drive in Scottish housing, I believe that the Government would be willing, as I hope they will, to come forward with a great deal more money to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of actually raising money. The hon. Member for Cathcart spoke in terms of selling houses. This has been talked about for a very long time. Over twenty years ago they were talking of selling off certain local authority houses. I am not against people owning their own houses, but what we must be careful about is that they do remain in single ownership and that we do not spend public money building houses which are taken over by financial companies and groups who would merely run them. If there were some way of ensuring that no one could own more than one house of the local authority or S.S.H.A. type, I think this would be a reasonable thing to do, and to look for methods of doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there are a great many things the Association can do in the future. There is a tremendous job for it. This Bill is the beginning, and I know from the general remarks of many members of the Government that this is just the beginning of a really big drive, whether through this agency or some other agency, to get Scottish housing out of the horrible condition in which it has been over the last fifty or sixty or more years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State covered the early history and inter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
esting it is too, and we should not forget the original objectives, because they still hold good, the first being to supplement the housing efforts of the local authorities. We must not forget this. Local authorities must not shelter behind the S.S.H.A. and fall down in their own efforts to build houses themselves. Secondly, it is and still does help to reduce the rate burden of local authorities; and thirdly to build houses in areas of special need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, of course, is where it has helped in my own constituency to a large measure. We have in the county area over 400 houses, the largest number being in Upper Nithsdale for the mining community, and there is a fair number for an interesting reason, for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority in Lower Annandale. Then there is the large Burgh of Dumfries and other small burghs with over 300 houses between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This number of 723 houses may not seem large in relation to the 60,000 built by the Scottish Special Housing Association, but it is of immense importance in a rural community, and, of course, the same considerations apply in other rural counties. The relatively small numbers of houses we have compared with the industrial areas is of greater importance to us because our problem is rather different from that in the central belt of Scotland. We should pay tribute to the Housing Association for building in such a wide variety of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be remembered that the Association receives no contributions from the local authorities. Its total income comes from rents and Exchequer subsidy, so there is a substantial saving to the local authorities. The financial aspect of the matter is the crux of local authority housing. I have always said that the problems of local authorities are far more in the realm of finance than administration, and the burden of the housing account, particularly now when short-term money may cost 7 or 71/8 per cent., will loom very large in their future building programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In welcoming the Bill, I have one or two comments to add to what has been said by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) about planning and amenities. In certain cases we can produce some very fine housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
schemes, but I feel that we should look at this aspect of Scottish housing very carefully. As the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) said, we want more houses for old-age pensioners. Local authorities have not allocated a sufficient proportion of their building target to small houses for old-age pensioners. We should see that the Scottish Special Housing Association spends its money wisely in the layout of its schemes. Quality of finish is extremely important from the point of view of long-term maintenance costs. Very often, although the layout may seem attractive, the actual building itself and the design of the houses is often below what one would like to see. In this respect, we are somewhat handicapped in Scotland because we have to harl most of our houses because the bricks are not of sufficient quality. One would like to see a greater variety of finish and a higher quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not make sufficient provision for amenity and sporting opportunities. Perhaps we lay out half an acre for a football pitch when we really ought to be thinking in terms of two or three acres. There is a high rainfall in Scotland, and it is no use thinking that one football pitch can survive being played on twice a day four or five days a week. Either we must lay out all-weather grounds and pitches using hard material which can withstand or absorb water and support any number of games in the week or we must provide more turf pitches. This is not done. I urge local authorities and housing committees to allocate more space in their housing schemes for this purpose, if possible. I realise that land is expensive and difficult to obtain, but, over a period of 10, 20 or 30 years, a really good layout giving good opportunity for games will reap tremendous benefit for the young people who, we hope, will live in these housing estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have many schemes of high quality from the planning point of view. The Housing Association has employed some really top-rank architects like Sir Robert Matthew, and others, of Edinburgh University. We should set a high standard. If we can get people to come and look at our housing schemes in Scotland and set an example way ahead of England and Wales and, perhaps, of Europe, they will be inclined to say, "This is where
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
we want to come and set up a factory". The higher the housing standard in Scotland the greater will be the chance of persuading management to think in terms of bringing industry to develop the areas which we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Bill and wish the Housing Association every success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill. I have had some experience of the work of the Scottish Special Housing Association. If the Bill has done nothing else, it has allowed the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) to thrash once again his well known hobbyhorse of rents and rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opening the debate, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave a historical review of the Scottish Special Housing Association's functions. I recall the time just after the war when it did a magnificent job for transferred miners and for farm workers. The longer I listen to this debate, the more I begin to wonder whether hon. Members opposite think that the Association will take over the functions of the local authorities. It is not there to run local authority housing. It is there to help where necessary, and, in my experience, it always has been necessary, although I must say that, when I was a housing convenor, I was just a little jealous sometimes of the purpose and functions of the Scottish Special Housing Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown). On two or three occasions, the Scottish Special Housing Association lowered the standard of house building in Scotland. Often, the finish left very much to be desired. I put that down to lack of proper supervision, of course. Edinburgh was always a popular place when the Association was bringing out a new protoype. The local authorities were invited to view it, the idea being that they might introduce the new design in their own schemes. At one time, we had a space-saving house, but this took away cupboard space which the housewife very much needed. It was done just to save a little money on completion of the house. There was also the lowered standard of ceiling, from 8 ft. to 7ft. 6ins. I have always understood that the higher the ceiling the better for the health of the people living in the house, but medical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
opinion suddenly changed and agreed that a 7 ft. 6 ins. ceiling was high enough for anyone to live in health and comfort. No doubt, there was the advantage that a tall person could whitewash the ceiling without getting up steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will be of great value to Scotland. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) mentioned the Highlands. I was always under the impression that this was one of the jobs which the Scottish Special Housing Association did because local authorities in the Highlands could not face the cost of hauling material to remote areas. The Association stepped in and did the job for them. If I am wrong, I stand to be corrected, but I have had long experience as a housing convenor and I have always had a great deal of faith in the Association and supported it to a certain extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been references to the selling of Housing Association houses. We are always hearing about the selling of houses. It is curious that when they talk about selling houses, hon. Members opposite always tell us about the length of their housing queue. Would it not be more advantageous for the well being of the people of Scotland to build more houses to let and fewer for sale? Not everyone can afford to buy a house. We have heard a great deal about the number of people in Glasgow waiting for a house, yet people talk in terms of the Scottish Special Housing Association building for sale. This is nonsense. The problem is too large. I hope that the Government will quickly return to the policy of the first Labour Government from 1945 onwards, when there was a reduction rather than an increase in the number of houses for sale, when local authorities could say, "We will allocate so many houses for private building and the rest will go for public building to let". The Scottish Special Housing Association came in at that time and helped, and I hope that it will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Association was one of the pioneers in the use of poured concrete. We hear a lot about faster building nowadays. The use of poured concrete is one of the fastest methods of building which we have in Scotland. At one time when I was a housing convener, a firm started the first group of four houses in August and a block of 12 was handed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
over in December of the same year. One cannot have much faster than that. I urge the Government to consider greater use of poured concrete house construction methods when they are thinking in terms of speedier house building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my objections to the work of the Scottish Special Housing Association was that it was inclined to lower standards while, at the same time, operating a higher rents policy. This was one of the problems we had to face. An applicant was offered a Scottish Special house probably costing £6 a year more than a similar house built by the local authority. I should like to see the local authorities building more and the Scottish Special Housing Association building less. However, until that time comes, I shall welcome the Bill and what it does. I hope that it will go through without any trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Y. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very interested in the Secretary of State's historical review. I noted that the Scottish Special Housing Association comes under his control. This being so, he should have no difficulty in helping the Highlands through the Association. In the Highlands there is a tremendous need for housing in small groups to help local factories. In my own constituency I have an enterprising knitwear manufacturer who now requires more houses. He cannot get them from the local authority because they are needed for replacements and increases in staff. Although a local authority always says that houses will be available for key men, when there is a housing queue individual councillors stand out against houses being taken out of the queue and being given to key men coming into the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Special Housing Association could play an important part in bringing industry into the Highlands and in Highland development. The one thing that anyone starting an industry needs is special skill, and one cannot expect to find it in the Highlands. One can bring Highlanders back, and many are willing to come, but there must be houses for them. The local authorities, of course, are among the poorest in Scotland. A 1d. rate raises remarkably little in counties like Sutherland. There is here an admirable opportunity to help development in the Highlands which, I have no doubt,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
the Secretary of State will grasp. As many hon. Members have said, this has been one of the functions of the Scottish Special Housing Association, and I hope that the Secretary of State will see to it that it continues in this rôle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) and his plea for better design and layout on Scottish Special Housing Association estates. I hope that it will never again perpetrate the sort of thing that was done at Fintry in Dundee, which, in my opinion, was the nearest approach to hell or, at least, purgatory which one could construct for people to live in. No doubt, the individual houses were a tremendous boon to the people who came to live in them. No doubt, they were delighted to have them and are living happy lives there. But it is an eyesore. The appearance is so even that every effort to vary the houses just makes things look more uniform and dull. It is a large maze, and I hope that the Association never repeats that sort of mistake anywhere else. It is interesting that so many hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have made this point, and stressed that the design and layout, not only of houses but of the whole estate, will play a large part in future house building by the Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Cullen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of what I had intended to say has already been said. When the Scottish Special Housing Association came into operation my predecessor, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland at that time, came to the Glasgow Corporation to boost this organisation which was to help to build houses. We have heard much of the good job which the Association has done, but people in Glasgow are not of that opinion, As has been said, the houses were inferior and the rents for them were dearer. It was possible to go into a street where the Association would be building houses on one side and the local authority would be building on the other, and rents for the Association houses would be higher than those charged for local authority houses. This was so much so that people were refusing to accept Association houses. The work of the Association, therefore, was not such a boost for Glasgow. Its houses had low ceilings and the halls were so
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
small that people could not get their furniture in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Association is under the control of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, surely he will be able to control the type of house which the Association builds and ensure that good houses rather than inferior houses are built, and also that the rents are in the region of those of local authority houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the best houses in Glasgow and the cheapest houses are built by direct labour. I have inspected houses on the south side and on the west side, at Drumchapel, Scotstoun and Surrey Street, and I have found that the houses in the Gorbals were the best of the lot. I hope that the Secretary of State will keep his eye on the Association and see that the people get the kind of houses which they are entitled to expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This comparatively small Bill has given us a useful opportunity for raising a number of various points connected with housing, including, I was happy to note, the subject of football fields, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should welcome the Bill, partly on account of this opportunity it gives us to discuss housing fairly generally. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Wood-side (Mr. Carmichael)—I agreed with him up to a point—appealed to us not to be too partisan in our approach to the problems of housing—and he pointed out how good his side were when they were in Opposition. As I say, I agree with him to a certain extent, but at the same time I do not think this should prevent us from being highly critical of whatever Government are in power. I for one have always been very critical of the previous Government for not pressing on even faster than they did with solving our housing problems, for I think housing is one of the biggest problems which face us in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the very substantial progress which the previous Administration made in solving a great many of these problems there still remains a tremendous amount more to be done. In every speech which I have had the opportunity to make I have always tried to urge that we should allocate a higher proportion of Government funds to housing, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
it should have a much higher priority than has ever been accorded to it in the past. I am still firmly of that opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this Bill because it will enable the Scottish Special Housing Association to make an even more valuable contribution than it has made in the past. I cannot go along with the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. J. Hill) who appears to fear that the Association may at some time or another try to take over from the local authorities. Nor can I share in his apprehension about private house building. No doubt he is one of those not in favour of the idea of a property-owning democracy which I personally do support, but clearly the housing problem in Scotland is such that there is ample scope for every conceivable method of producing more houses at a faster rate. There is room for S.S.H.A., local authority and private house building, and anything which can be done to encourage all of them is obviously a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the great question which must face any Government is, Are we doing everything we possibly can to produce a greater number of houses? We do feel, and a great many people in Scotland would be very pleased indeed if they did, that the Government came out with a broad declaration of policy to produce more houses faster—and I certainly will bless anybody who gets on with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is not only finance. Speaking from some knowledge of my own constituency I know that finance there is certainly not one of the greatest problems in producing more housing. Nor is it a shortage of land. One of the things which holds us up is the difficulty of getting skilled building labour. This is a very great problem, and one which, I think, can probably be met to some extent by an increase in the production of houses by factory methods. I believe that there there is enormous scope for expansion. I hope that the S.S.H.A. will also be able to participate in this type of building, because clearly this is one of the ways in which we can overcome some of the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main problem of the two biggest cities of Scotland, Glasgow and Edinburgh, is how to deal with the intense
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
overcrowding which exists there. I wonder whether I should be going too far beyond the scope of this Bill were I to ask the Secretary of State for Scotland whether he can give us any idea about any big schemes he has in mind for relieving the problem facing Glasgow particularly, perhaps by the provision of a new city rather than a new town—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in a debate on this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which, I think, would be extremely valuable. I think that in the past we have been a little too unambitious in town developments to house 80,000 to 90,000 people. I am not sure we ought not to find a site for a new city—something which certainly would make a dramatic impact in relieving Glasgow's housing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with housing associations generally, I was very interested to notice that the Episcopal Church of Scotland has now entered the field. Although, clearly, it cannot itself produce any major solution to the housing problem it is at least another example of a body which is trying to impress upon the rest of us the need to tackle this problem more realistically than we have done in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, I welcome this little Bill so far as it goes, and I personally shall support the Secretary of State whenever I can when he tries to produce more houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inspired to take part in the debate by the remarks of the noble Lord, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith). He raised a point which is often forgotten in such debates as this, that it is not the Government who produce houses but the building trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The building trade is a curious one. The idea that the Government, even by saying that it will spend £100 million, can build one extra house, is nonsense. The building trade takes a long time to readjust itself to a change of programme. When I was responsible for many of these things I found that when we debated hospitals we were accused of not building enough hospitals, when we had a debate on education we were accused of not providing sufficient schools, in a housing debate we were accused of not building
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
enough houses. Everyone wanted more. The point is that the building trade has a certain capacity which cannot be increased. At that time the Minister of Works had not to allocate the money but to decide what proportion of the building trade would be devoted to which purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very large part of the building trade—as it may surprise some hon. Members to know—is engaged in maintaining houses. If it is possible to save building a new house by maintaining an existing house, that represents a very important contribution, and about half of the building trade is occupied in maintenance work and repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had to make an allocation in respect of churches and schools and other buildings, and it was calculated when I was responsible, that if we built a junior college—this was just after the war—it meant that we should have to sacrifice the building of 120 houses. The same thing applied in respect of the provision of a health centre. Although we might be anxious to provide a health centre, we had to decide whether it was more important to do that than to provide houses to house the people cured at a health centre of ills which arose through living in bad housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my right hon. Friend agree that in deciding to build the Polaris base we have denied ourselves an opportunity to build 2,000 houses in Scotland and that it is a question of priorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first priority is to see that the country is secure, otherwise there is no purpose in building houses at all. If a few bombs came from Russia there would be few houses left in the whole of Scotland, so we have to make sure that a deterrent exists to prevent the houses which we have already built from being destroyed. But that is another question.

It is necessary to distribute the building labour if it is desired to increase building. It is not only a question of increasing the number of skilled men. It is necessary to increase the quantity of bricks and timber and glass which are available, and to provide bathroom taps and similar things, so that a multitude of trades are affected when a programme is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
rearranged and new targets set. All this takes a great deal of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the terms of reference to the Scottish Special Housing Association one factor mentioned by the noble Lord has not been given sufficient consideration. Originally the Association had two purposes, to supplement building, not only by building houses but by using labour which otherwise would not have been used, and to invent new types of building which would not prove such a drain on the scarce supply of skilled labour. The Association has done this, and has done a great service in promoting the use of poured concrete, as was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. J. Hill), and by other unusual methods of building. The Association has been a pioneer in respect of the provision of multistorey flats and has performed a tremendous service in showing the building trade that other methods can be used than the normal ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the idea of factory building which was established just after the war. I found to my surprise that factory building turned out to be more expensive than orthodox building. The great scientific consortia provided estimates which proved to be more expensive than those of the village builder working with traditional methods. This seems all haywire from the point of view of common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) has probably done more in pioneering new methods and ideas in building, and probably knows more about this subject than any of us here. He has shown that it is possible to build good houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What surprises me is that there is such a variety of houses. When somebody gets a good house I do not see why they do not go on building such houses, but every new architect has to design houses of his own and he usually makes the same mistakes which architects made thirty years ago. There should be the possibility of getting ideal houses. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen) spoke about some of the houses built in Glasgow. Some of the architects who built the houses made the lobbies so narrow that, by the time people had put up their pegs and hung their hats
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
and coats on them, there was no room to get through the lobby. How at this time of day architects can design these things and local authorities can approve them passes my comprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office ought to have some sort of standard house from which many of these snags have been eliminated. They should take the best houses in Scotland. I do not want to advertise, but in my constituency there are some of the best houses in Scotland and my hon. Friend the Member for the Gorbals also knows some good houses. Why cannot these be made a model for all local authorities? Why should new architects go on making the same mistakes and different mistakes every time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Special Housing Association has not received sufficient credit for its splendid work. When people talk about high rents I would remind them that the Association was an additional subsidy to Scottish housing, because when a local authority built its own houses it had to pay its own rates on the houses, but when the Association built special houses for an authority the Government paid the rates and this was an additional contribution to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government had no responsibility for the fact that many local authorities wanted to subsidise the rents of their own tenants. There was no reason why the Government should subsidise the rents of those tenants because the local authorities wanted to get excessive subsidies for the tenants of their own houses. The Government have to run their affairs in a businesslike way and to charge a rent which, while not an economic rent, is approximately equal to the local authority rents in a district. Although, if the local authority wanted to it could change afterwards, when the rents have been fixed by law, the S.S.H.A. could not change its rents in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that credit will be given to the Association for the splendid work it has done in Scotland, and for its pioneering work. I hope it will be used for this purpose still, to discover and develop new methods of production, and that it can side track, as it were, bottlenecks in normal methods of production. This was one of its primary functions. It has done it in the past and I am sure it will do it in the future and that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
Government will provide whatever money is necessary to meet the targets which the Association is able to attain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot go into a local authority area and build in spite of the local authority. It must do so with consent. Tribute should be paid also to it for the tactful way it managed to assist local authorities without undermining their 	<i>amour propre.</i> I am glad the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North did not mention his own local authorities near where he lives, because its housing accomplishments would not be a great tribute to local authority housing and it could have done with a great deal more assistance from the Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to Edinburgh I should point out that one of its main handicaps has been not shortage of finance, nor shortage of land, but shortage of skilled building labour. This has been a repeated problem, and because of that I do not think it is quite fair of the right hon. Gentleman to criticise the local authority in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that if too many houses are built there is an auction sale for building labour, where, as after the war skilled men were running around from one job to another and there were not enough to go round. The S.S.H.A. was created to obviate this difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unfortunate if this Committee were to leave the impression in the minds of the country that the sole purpose of our discussion is to condemn the standards of the S.S.H.A. Before I came to the House, as the Secretary of State will know, I served as convener of the Glasgow overspill committee and part of my duty was to visit many towns in Scotland with which the Glasgow Corporation had an overspill agreement and to see the houses built by the Association. I am prepared to concede that on occasions we found houses which were not up to standard, but we would find this in houses built by private building companies or local authorities. It would be unfortunate if we were to use this debate solely to suggest that the Association has not done a good job of work for building. I remember looking at the faces of young mothers in Kirkintilloch and Whitburn and the pride they had in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
homes provided for them by this Association. These people had been taken out of some of the most dreadful slums in Western Scotland and had found a new life owing to the help of the Association and the architects who designed the houses. Very often special layouts had been provided by landscape artists and the like. It would be wrong to continue to speak as we are doing. We should bear in mind that it may detract a little from what people think about building standards in the south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) did something of a disservice to industrial life in Scotland by suggesting that we did not have enough private houses for sale. I know it is important, when we are trying to attract industrialists from the South or from the Americas to come to Scotland, that there should be adequate facilities for the executives of companies, but if the hon. Gentleman will look, any Tuesday or Thursday morning, at the editions of 	<i>The Glasgow Herald </i>or 	<i>The Scotsman </i>he will see very ample supplies of houses for sale in the most attractive parts of Scotland. I remember taking industralists who had come over from America to establish factories in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Archie Manuel) and they saw not only a good industrial site, but an area of good communications with a big city, and splendid amenities in the way of golf courses. They also saw many splendid houses for private sale. It would be wrong for the impression to get about that we had not got facilities in Scotland for people in top management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing is to ensure that central planning for Scotland is put into effect, and this is the real purpose of the Association. I cannot agree that the Association seeks to usurp the functions of the local authority. The Association realises that its function is to supplement the efforts of local authorities, and they could never have got ahead and made the contribution which they have made to industrial methods without the assistance of the Association. This was particularly true of Kirkantilloch and Whitburn where we were able to house many people employed in the B.M.C. factory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also suggested by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Government's present policies were such that the Association's resources could not be fully employed in the future. This came rather ill from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I said. I asked the Secretary of State if he could assure us that in the months to come these resources would be fully used. I was not making any statement about the present situation. I was seeking information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point which the hon. Gentleman makes, but asking the question at all seems to imply that there was some indication that for political purposes there might be some limitation on the work being done. When the hon. Gentleman was an Under-Secretary at the Scottish Office in charge of the housing department, and in the time of his predecessors, there was often a trough in the number of houses built in the reception areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, but as he is making such references to me I must tell him that it was for this kind of reason that I inquired. Anybody who has any concern about the S.S.H.A. is of course concerned that its resources should be fully used. I am not trying to make any particular point about this. I have had experience of this, and I realise it is one of the important questions which comes to mind when one is dealing with the Association. The hon. Member misunderstood me on the question of home ownership. I was saying that increasingly key personnel moving into Scotland will want to own their own homes. Fortunately, as he said, there is a realisation of this, and there are some available, but if he visits the overspill area and some of the new firms going in he will know that this is one of their main problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that home ownership is one of the important questions, but it is important to point out that, in the last five years in particular, we have tended to have these troughs in house building and the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn must accept responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He went on to suggest that the cost of house building was a very serious problem for the S.S.H.A. It is something I am worried about. While we are concerned with the cost of building houses in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
Scotland we are also very much concerned, as I am sure the Association also is, with the cost of land, when it is obliged to buy, particularly in these reception areas. I trust that the Secretary of State in the next few months will appeal to his colleagues in the Cabinet to take a very strong line on an issue of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I welcome this Bill. I believe that the Association is the real hope of effective planning in Scotland. More power to its elbow!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to enter the debate, but, as some of my hon. Friends know, I have a great interest in the building industry, and I know some of its very great difficulties and problems. The difficulties which face my particular firm must be indeed the difficulties which face the S.S.H.A. The greatest difficulty is the weather with which we have to contend. While we may speak of bad housing provided by private enterprise firms or by corporations or by the Association there are many factors militating against firms getting the houses they desire. Often it is not the fault of the Association or of private enterprise firms that houses do not come up to the standards one would wish. One of the great problems which confront the industry is the weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor about which I feel very strongly is that of contracting. For many years we have proceeded along the same old lines of scheduling and contracting, and unless we alter that fundamentally I cannot see our getting continuity of work which is necessary to cure our problems in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do I say that? A contract is made and a fine organisation is built up and reaches its peak of perfection, but never is it at the peak of perfection at the beginning; that only comes when the contract is finishing. What happens when the job is finished? The organisation disbands. Then prices have to be put in again, and the whole question of prices for other jobs goes through the melting pot again. Departments, too, are sometimes not free from blame in the delaying of contracts. There is often considerable delay in getting schedules approved by the local authority. I believe quite sin-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
cerely that if we want to tackle this problem reasonably and satisfactorily we must alter the contractual system. We must try to get continuity of work in the industry instead of breaking down the organisation which firms have built up in the course of a contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other factors which militate against houses being built in Scotland. The building industry has always been stretched to some extent, although there is always a certain volume of unemployed building labour going through the labour exchange. That is understandable. They are moving from pillar to post, from one contract to another. There are other factors militating against the construction of houses. One is the planning. The estate has to be planned, and that needs individuals with the qualifications to plan. The next thing is getting out schedules, which necessitates a great deal of work by quantity surveyors—and there is a great shortage of quantity surveyors. Nor when the job is completed is it possible to get the final payments, because quantity surveyors, of the local authority or private people, are unable to measure up the work, and many contractors are laying out considerable sums of money which could well be used in the construction and building up of their enterprises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman allow me? I am interested in hearing him admit that the building industry has been pretty fully stretched in recent years. He said, before that, that there has been difficulty with continuity of contracts. Has this been a very big problem in his own experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Quite a considerable problem—a very considerable one, indeed. At the moment my firm is working with roughly 500 men on one contract, and the position is that when that contract finishes, if no other contract comes along, the labour force has to be dispensed with. This happens time and time again, and is a problem we have to look at very seriously. Once a machine is stopped it is difficult to get it started again, and there is considerable waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the quantity surveyors, but there are other problems. There are the engineers. New cities and new towns have been mentioned, but there is the question of planning a new city or a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
new town. This takes years and years of work. Not only that, but after the planning has been done engineers have to be brought in to make up sewers and roads and give the proper contours of the ground. This also takes a great deal of time and there are not sufficient engineers to do that. Only a certain amount of work can be done in the time, and we want to get the best results for the money which is being spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one great advantage which I see in the Scottish Special Housing Association, in that it gets better continuity of work than a private enterprise firm. It does not have to schedule to the same extent. Not that I think that is wrong; I think that is correct; but we should learn from that, and do something so far as local authorities are concerned for continuity of contract and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the hon. Gentleman the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) who spoke on the question of increased cost, I would say I was not trying to put him in difficulty. I am anxious for someone to give me an authoritative statement on the increased cost of houses over the last 12 months. I do not say he is wrong in saying it is £100. There are many reasons for this increase. Take copper, for instance, which has gone up by more than 100 per cent. There is a considerable amount of copper used in the houses we are building. Practically every item of material used in the building industry has gone up in price by leaps and bounds. This gives rise to great uncertainty for the contractor in putting in his price. He has no idea what the cost is going to be to him in the twelve months ahead. This is causing some boosting up of prices, and at times other contractors take a chance—and that gives rise to one of the many problems which confront our industry, the problem of bankruptcy. The number of firms which go bankrupt in the building industry is greater than in any other industry. This is not a healthy state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole crux of the matter is to get a better contractual system. This would not only be of benefit to the local authority and to the tenants of the houses by way of lower costs but it would also give continuity of work and contracts to the contractors.

My right hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) mentioned the question of priorities. Take the question of the Polaris submarine base. Do not let us argue about the merits or otherwise of the base. We have our own points of view about which should come first, the chicken or the egg. Here are represented 2,000 houses and workers are being employed the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am very reluctant to interrupt the hon. Member, but he must come closer to the subject of the Bill, and I notice that there are other people wishing to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. My hon. Friend was talking about building labour absorbed in the building of the Polaris base; he was not talking about the submarine. In view of the fact that in yesterday's paper a contract was announced of over £900,000 involving building labour, is he not likely to be in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baxter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would direct attention to the fact that contracts, be they for one thing or another, for bases or contracts for English contractors to come up to Scotland on a negotiated basis, take away building trade labour from housing contracts, because workers are enticed away by higher rates of wages. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) has stated that in Edinburgh houses cannot be built because they have not the workers. Workers cannot be available for everything, and if they are taken by English firms and put on a Polaris base, on a school or a hospital, because a negotiated contract can pay them better rates than can the contractor who is building houses in Scotland, or the Scottish Special Housing Association, a difficulty at once arises. I have a little pecuniary interest in the building industry, and experience of it. I should like to put the picture right in the eyes of the Committee. It is easy to say that we will build so many houses but we must have regard to the labour, and the difficulties involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest the Scottish Special Housing Association is being handicapped, as my hon. Friend

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) said, if it does not get a certain amount of priority of labour. Although I would not dream of trying to trespass, or to be out of order in raising the question of the Polaris submarine, I only want to suggest that construction in that part of Scotland is going to take up an immense amount of building trades and construction labour which will not be available to the Scottish Special Housing Association. I should imagine that there is a great demand by Scottish housing for plasterers, plumbers and constructional engineers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must point out to the hon. Member, as I pointed out to the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter), that this Bill is concerned with finance for the Scottish Special Housing Association. I would be much obliged if he would restrict his remarks to that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I think this is relevant. The Scottish Special Housing Association will not be able to spend this amount of money on the labour which is necessary for constructing the houses if the labour is being utilised elsewhere. My argument is that there is a shortage at present of plasterers and plasterboard, and if this continues, although finance may be granted in this Bill, it will not be possible to spend it. I suggest it is relevant to think what this money means in terms of building labour and construction. If the Scottish Special Housing Association wants to spend this money in Ayrshire it cannot do so if the building materials and workers are being directed elsewhere, to what I believe is something which should not have priority. If that is so this Bill is not going to be of as much benefit to Scotland as it would be if the building labour were available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen the Scottish Special Housing Association develop since its inception, and in our part of the world we have competition between the municipalities, the county council and the Scottish Special Housing Association. We think the Scottish Special Housing Association, although it has frequently been open to criticism for the quality of its work, should be considered and every possible help given to it. My only regret is that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
the amount of money in this Bill is not much greater to enable us to build the larger number of houses which are needed at the present time before we can solve the housing problem of the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the first thing I should do is to congratulate either you, Mr. Brewis, or the Secretary of State, I am not certain which, on what I think must be the record number of speeches in any one morning in a Scottish Committee, Standing or Grand. Whether this is the result of the shortness of the Bill I do not know, but at a rough count 18 people will have made speeches—17 different people, because I expect the right hon. Gentleman is going to wind up. This augurs well for our debates in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But having congratulated, at least partially, the Secretary of State on that, I am bound to admit that I was frankly amazed at how things change. The right hon. Gentleman's reputation in the House of Commons over the years, since, I am certain, before I was in it, was that he was a tiger for accuracy and a most meticulous person on the detail which came into a Bill. Yet when my hon. Friend pointed out this slight difference between £50,000 and £500,000 the right hon. Gentleman said, "This is just a printer's error". Well now, I cannot believe that, if the position were reversed, and it was a year ago, we should not have had an hour's debate on this "appalling lapse" by the Secretary of State and every single Under-Secretary in the Scottish Office, on this "perfect scandal"—to bring to the House of Commons Bills so slovenly in their drafting that even though they have been in the Vote Office for several weeks no one in the Scottish Office and no Minister had noticed this tremendous error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the few minutes I want to take—and I know the Secretary of State has many questions to answer—I should like to keep to the purpose of the Bill, interested as we have all been to see the width of the discussion from contracting procedures to the problems of priority which lie on the shoulders of the Secretary of State, and which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) told us about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
All these are important and interesting, but the purpose of the Bill we have with us is to give the S.S.H.A. extra money. Everyone, on both sides of the Committee, has felt that extra money should be given to the S.S.H.A. although there has been some slight variation in opinion about whether it should be £10 million or £20 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say a word or two about the S.S.H.A., as the Secretary of State did, because anybody who has had to work with the Association realises what an important part it plays in the whole structure and the future of Scotland's industrial development. Some Members have criticised the quality of the Association's houses. The hon. Lady the Member for the Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen) and others have done so, and of course there have been odd grounds here and there for criticism, but I think, as other hon. Members have said, we could say the same of other contractors. But the point which the Secretary of State made in his opening speech, and which I think people on both sides of the Committee did not, perhaps, pick up as clearly as they should have done, is that the S.S.H.A., by its very nature, is often a fire brigade type of operation. In my experience it has often had to go in rather late in the day because there was a crisis of some sort or another, a large number of houses needed for an industrial development, and Linwood, Bathgate and Fort William have been mentioned. I think that in view of the considerable urgency with which its construction often has to take place, we in this Committee should realise the very high standard on average that the Association is now producing, and the very high standard it is trying to achieve in its planning and so forth. The fact that it has to move quickly is often extremely important to Scotland, and I, for my part think that it has done extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) said he hoped that there would be a new look in the whole of the S.S.H.A. building operations, but he then went on himself to admit that there has been a new look over the last year or two. He talked about the excellent team of designers got together and the experiments that they are doing and so on, and these points have been made by other hon. Members. There has been a new look, and I think the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
S.S.H.A. has learned the whole time from criticisms made in the past in this Committee, in Parliament, and elsewhere, and that it is now achieving considerable skill and ability and a greatly improved quality of house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enter into a great ideological battle on this, for we have had them often enough on perhaps more appropriate occasions, but various Members spoke about the problem of the S.S.H.A. being, as it were, awkward from a local authority's point of view because it charges higher rents. I think the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Stirlingshire described the position perfectly accurately. It is not the Association which was out of step with the local authorities. It was the other way round. This is one of the reasons why its building in the country districts has not caused this kind of problem, because in the country districts we do not tend to get these very heavily subsidised rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also interested in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) because he stressed the question of amenities, as one would expect from a person with his background. He brought in the important thing about football pitches. Well, if we have more large, well-designed and well-drained football pitches Scotland will, no doubt, be winning the Triple Crown before very long. But it is not only in amenities for the development of sport and so on that the S.S.H.A., in its comprehensive plans, can do well or badly. It is also of the greatest importance to incoming industrialists that the area they are coming to should be pleasant to look at and live in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would pick up the point the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie) made about this, because he knows a great deal about the S.S.H.A. He spoke kindly about it, but he was rather less than fair to my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). There is no doubt that in certain areas of Scotland there are some houses available for management, and so on, coming in, but if he had had as much experience as I have over the last few years, he would know that there are many other areas where we want to get industry and where new houses of this sort should be provided. Whether they are to be done by the Association,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
the new town corporations, or whatever authority, I think we must all realise that, in future, management personnel are looking for the better designed house. Often the ones which are available are those which were suitable for the eighteen-eighties but are not quite in keeping with the modern thinking of the modern management we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie), who has now had to leave us, that there is a place for the Association to help in Highland development. No doubt we shall hear more in a few minutes about when this idea gets off the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to sum up by saying that I think criticisms which there have been of that rather inferior type of houses, or rather too high rents, are really irrelevant at the present moment, because the S.S.H.A. is making great improvements. I am certain that with the extra money we are taking for it for the next few years it will continue to play an extremely important part in the life of Scotland and will continue to improve the quality and quantity of its houses. If it can build cheaper houses as a result of experimental work I do not think anyone on either side of the Committee will oppose that. I do oppose the idea that it should give specially subsidised rents, and I expect the Secretary of State does, too, because this is not the function of the Association. It has done a splendid job of work, often under very difficult conditions, for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
a printer's error and not an error made in the Scottish Office, and the printer has asked that his apologies be passed on. It was the Scottish Office that spotted it. It was not the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) phoning up the Department—who, as far as I know, has no houses being built by the Association in his area. What was the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) doing? He should have voiced concern about this. In spite of everything the overworked Scottish Office did discover that this perfect Bill had been rather spoiled, but I apologise because it was not I myself who discovered the omission. I recognise that the right hon. Gentleman seemed to think I had a reputation for accuracy. I am sorry that he did not in his new shadow capacity himself spot this error and lash us about it right away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that on the whole we have had a rather pleasant attitude towards the Scottish Special Housing Association. Everyone seemed to think that it is a rather wonderful association and should get on with building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I almost got the impression from the hon. Member for Cathcart that the only thing standing between it and driving on with the ambitious programme of the last Tory Government was a Socialist Secretary of State. The hon. Member has a remarkable capacity for looking facts in the face and not seeing anything at all that is staring him in the face. He will appreciate that in 1953 the Scottish Special Housing Association built nearly 5,000 houses. How many did it build in 1962 under that great driving ambitious Tory Government? Under 1,000; I think somewhere about 967; and it was not until two years ago that there was a sudden revival of interest. I do not remember many speeches by the noble Lord about the shortcomings of his Government and the Scottish Special Housing Association at that time. There was only then a realisation that here was the perfect instrument with which to get on with building and to give it the continuity that my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) was right to emphasise was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the credit of the right hon. Gentleman, I want to say that in respect of the last two years the position was much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
better. Still last year we were only building at just under a rate of 2,000. If it is anything to console the hon. Member for Cathcart, we hope to do better with the Scottish Special Housing Association this year and to build over 2,000 and to start between 2,000 and 2,500 and give it the continuity on which to base a better drive and programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is not the end. This is only, in a sense, an interim Measure till we do get geared together our full-term plans in relation to public investment and give a proper share to housing. I have said, and I am glad to repeat it, that we want to get as quickly as possible to 40,000 houses a year in Scotland and then proceed upwards and beyond that to the point when we get 40,000 public authority houses, with increased private building as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what is the basis of it all? There is the contractual system and there is also the building industry which must organise itself for the job. My hon. Friend was quite right in pointing to the trouble with contracts and contractors being unable to fulfil their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been references to the work done by the Scottish Special Housing Association for the pulp mill. Not all the houses are being built by the Association. Some of them are being built by the Inverness County Council, let out to a private contractor. Some are being built by the Fort William Council on private contract. Some are being built by the Scottish Special Housing Association. There have been shortages there, with the result that we saw in February. We were not keeping up to scratch in our target and we asked the Housing Association to undertake to come in and do additional building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the advantage of the Scottish Special Housing Association. It has a direct labour department with 1,400 people. It has got the architects and the quantity surveyors. With the backing of the Government, it can be used in this way. I am very glad that the right hon. Gentleman himself appreciated that this is worth while, but what I regret is that for so long it was lost sight of. At one time, I thought that the previous Government intended to wipe it out altogether. We have got to get back to building it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
I come now to some of the points which were raised in debate. First, house prices. The S.S.H.A. is an advantage here. Last year, comparing its ability to tender with tenders put in from private contractors, we saved about £187,000. It is reckoned to be 5 per cent. below the level of tenders from private firms for the same type of house. This is a considerable advantage and most desirable at a time when prices are rising. Of course, prices did not start rising seven months ago, and the rises which did occur then could not be related to something which we had done when we came in. There is a time-lag in price rises, and we have certainly had the doubtful benefit of that in many ways. We are watching the question of price rises, and I assure hon. Members that the Scottish Special Housing Association has done good work in keeping prices down and in using alternative methods and materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the houses of the Board of Trade industrial estate managers. These houses were built for the Board of Trade and financed by the Board of Trade. The decision to sell was the Board of Trade's, not ours. We certainly have no plans for the selling of further houses at present. What we want to build up in Scotland is a stock of houses into which people can move so that labour will not be held immobile. We need a stock of rented houses. I am not against even the Scottish Special Housing Association, if it has the capacity, building houses for sale in the right places. Goodness gracious—Kilmarnock Town Council does that, so I would not deny the right to the Housing Association in the right circumstances and in the right place. But its main task must be to build under the statutory obligations laid upon it. Hon. Members should appreciate what these are. The rundown in Scottish Special Housing Association building started from 1957, from the limitation which was placed upon it to co-operate with local authorities in respect of general need, particular jobs being put upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the question of assistance to the Housing Corporation under the 1964 Act was raised. The work has just started. A housing officer for Scotland has been appointed and he is working closely in co-operation with the Scottish Special Housing Association. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
are building in the growth areas. The Association has two schemes at present, one in Dumbarton in the Vale of Leven and one at Cowdenbeath in central Fife, to promote the building of houses for junior managers and scientific staff, the sort of thing that the right hon. Gentleman spoke about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this is, once again, a rescue operation by the Scottish Special Housing Association in face of the failure of the enterprising private builders we keep hearing about. This is a job which they should be doing if they were as good at it as hon. and right hon. Members opposite tell us. It is a good thing that we have the S.S.H.A. which can do this very job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) raised the question of standards. One of the troubles is that, once a house is built, it lasts for 60 years. After the war, there was a shortage of the perfect materials. There was a shortage of timber and we had to save timber. I say frankly that standards were sacrificed. Undoubtedly, local authorities resisted, but the Scottish Special Housing Association, a direct Government agency, responded. Timber was saved. Concrete was used in flooring, and so on. Those houses, compared with the houses which the Association is putting up today, are unsatisfactory. The result is that the people who are in them still grouse when they compare what they have got with the others. But we should not lose our sense of perspective and blame the Association for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The houses which the S.S.H.A. is putting up today, in construction, layout, finish and everything else are first class. I had the opportunity of opening the sixty-thousandth house in Irvine. It was a scheme worthy of pride—not pride on the part of the S.S.H.A., on the part of Members of Parliament or members of the Government, but pride on the part of people who will occupy them; and there was certainly evidence of that. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie), with his personal experience, appreciated that point. The Housing Association has this ability to go into an area quickly and, with its experience, put forward a com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
prehensive layout of good quality. This, to my mind, is one of its great advantages and why it should be attractive to local authorities dealing with overspill. I assure my hon. Friend that I am determined to use it not just to maintain standards but to raise them and, to that extent, to be a means of discipline on everyone else in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter), but the houses to which he referred were not built by the Scottish Special Housing Association. They were built by the Scottish National Housing Company during the 1914–18 war, and they were taken over by the S.S.H.A. in 1963, only two years ago. The houses need to be repaired and modernised. How far does one go? One will never be able to make good houses out of them, so we are trying to do the balanced thing by doing them up to give reasonable amenities while, at the same time, not spending too much money on the quality of the houses as such. He will appreciate that particular difficulty arises in respect of the N type of house, and the improvement there has not proved very satisfactory. I assure him that my Department is in touch with the S.S.H.A. about this to see whether we can get a better form of improvement. I hope that this will help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathoart did not fully appreciate the point which he raised on the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. This is not grant in respect of one year. It is an overall estimate of what will fall on the Votes in an accumulation of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Association is doing a tremendous amount of work for Glasgow at the present time. It has 1,870 houses under construction in the city, and it has plans in hand for a further 2,236. This is no vindication of the charge that it is slowing down or dragging its feet. I want to see a get-together between the Association and Glasgow Corporation, particularly in the central redevelopment areas. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Woodside (Mr. Carmichael) is relevant to this particular task. Glasgow has an enormous amount of building to be done, rebuilding, hauling down and the rest, and I want to be able to use the Scottish Special Housing Association as much as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) showed once again how valuable the Association was when we had to transfer miners from one area to another and we were able to put them into Ayrshire, into Sanquhar and Dumfries and so on and get on with the building of houses. Now, when we are faced with regional development and the problem of bringing industries into areas where the local authorities cannot really be expected to support the financial burden of new houses, whether in the Highlands or the Borders, the Scottish Special Housing Association can be used, and I hope that it will be used. But, let it be remembered, this must always be done in co-operation with the local authorities. The Housing Association must not supplement the local authorities. The local authorities must not lean back and say, "Let someone else do it". They have their own responsibilities for their own areas, and they must not shove them off on to anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task of building new houses in Scotland is such that we cannot ignore any agency whatever. We are fortunate in having the Scottish Special Housing Association and in the quality of the people it employs. This Bill asking for an extra £10 million is, to my mind, a holding operation until we can get together with longer-term plans on how we can properly expand the use of the Scottish Special Housing Association. I do not believe that there is any other way by which we could have got those 60,000 valuable houses since 1937, and I am absolutely convinced that this will not be the end of the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been welcomed pretty widely by hon. Members. The work that can be done in the raising of housing standards and the setting of standards of amenities is something which, I am sure, has not been and will not be lost sight of. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) asked for credit to be given to the S.S.H.A. for the work it has done. In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
my view, it has done astoundingly good work, particularly latterly. It has shown what can be done, and it has set standards for Scottish housing. When we criticise housing by the Association, everyone appreciates that the older types of public authority building in Scotland leave an awful lot to be desired from the point of view of aesthetics, amenity and the rest. We must set ourselves new standards, and we must be prepared to pay for these new standards. We shall not get the new Scotland on the cheap. I am absolutely convinced that the S.S.H.A. will be able to play a big part in the new Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
