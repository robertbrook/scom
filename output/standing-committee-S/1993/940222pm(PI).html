	<div class='title'>TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 90, in page 4, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) An order under this section in the case of any person who on 31st March 1996 is in the employment of one or more local authorities who are or include an authority which ceases to exist by virtue of Part I of this Act, shall make such provision as is necessary to ensure that, to the extent, if any, to which, by reason only of the said Part I of this Act, that person would apart from the order cease on 1 st April 1996 to be in such employment, that person is transferred on 1st April 1996 to the employment of such local authority as may be specified in or determined under the order.".—	<i>[Mr. McLeish.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 91, in page 4, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) An order under this section shall include such provision with respect to any person who is transferred by or under the order from the employment of one authority to that of another so as to secure that.
	<ol>
	<li>so long as he continues in the employment of that other authority by virtue of the transfer and until he is served with a statement in writing referring to the order and specifying new terms and conditions of employment, he enjoys terms and conditions of employment not less favourable than those which he enjoyed immediately before the date of transfer; and</li>
	<li>the said new terms and conditions are such that—
	<ol>
	<li>so long as he is engaged in duties reasonably comparable to those in which he was engaged immediately before the date of transfer, the scale of his salary or remuneration, and</li>
	<li>the other terms and conditions of his employment,</li></ol>
are not less favourable than those which he enjoyed immediately before the date of transfer.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tain Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister is wrong about the transfer of staff, and I am sure that he is wrong about the timetable. The purpose of amendment No. 90 is to ensure that all local authority employees on the 31 March 1996 transfer to a new authority on 1 April 1996. It incorporates the provision in section 216(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Many people read our proceedings and it will make more sense if I read this out.
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order under this section in the case of any person who on 31st March 1996 is in the employment of one or more local authorities who are or include an authority which ceases to exist by virtue of Part I of this Act, shall make such provision as is necessary to ensure that, to the extent, if any, to which, by reason only of the said Part I of this Act, that person would apart from the order cease on 1st April
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
1996 to be in such employment, that person is transferred on 1st April 1996 to the employment of such local authority as may be specified in or determined under the order."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that is clear enough for those who read our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As amendment No. 90 is supported by the employing authority and by the trade unions and staff associations and is considered to be the best way forward in the circumstances of reorganisation, why on earth cannot the Government accept it? No convincing answer has been given to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1973 Act set out the basic principles on the transfer of staff from the existing to the new authorities and the compensation arrangements that would be in place for those who were redundant. Are those basic principles anywhere to be found in the Bill? If not, why not? The Committee deserves to know. I reiterate that the Minister is incorrect. The general principle of transfer was set out in sections 216(2) and 216(3) of the 1973 Act. The specific requirement to transfer all staff allowed detailed advice from the staff commission. That has not been done on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 in law—we have checked this in the interval—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I would rather like the Minister's attention when the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has completed his conversation with him. We are told that clause 9 deals only with the continuity of employment of staff transferred; it does not deal with the substantive issue of transfer. That legal opinion was confirmed over the telephone. I should like to know whedier the Scottish Office refute it, and if so, upon what grounds. In England the staff commission has been given policy guidance by the Department of the Environment. It says that the staff commission should take account of the Government's position on TUPE regulations. What is the difference between Scotiand and England in that respect? I hope that those questions wdl be answered some time before the night is over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is this morning's assertion that the timing of the reorganisation is no different from the timing of the previous reorganisation. That is factually not the case.This reorganisation will take place in half the time. It is no good saying that this is simpler than in the 1970s, because many people think that, far from being simple, it is actually more difficult than in the 1970s because of the nature of modern technology and the difficulty of unpicking the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we go over the facts? The Wheatiey commission was set up in 1965. The commission's proposals were published in 1969, and the White Paper was published in February 1971. The publication of the Local Government (Scotiand) Bill was in October 1972, and it received Royal Assent in November 1973. On 2 April 1973, the Scottish local government staff advisory committee was appointed. On 13 November 1973, the Scottish local government staff commission was appointed. On 7 May 1974, shadow elections for new regions, islands and districts were set up, and on 16 May 1975 the reorganisation of the new local authorities took place. That spans almost a decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the timetable this time? The consultative document was published in October 1992. Parliamentary colleagues will not take it amiss if I say that the consultative document did not hold a candle to the care and consultation of the Wheatiey commission. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
Minister's predecessor and my erstwhile pair, Miss Betty Harvie Anderson, Tom Fraser, Ames Imrie, an extremely competent local government official, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) and others went up and down the country consulting and listening properly. The repeated reaction from local authority staff was that the Wheatley commission had come to see them, had listened to them, had asked relevant questions, and had reflected on what they had said. None of that has been done this time. In Banff and Buchan and in many other places—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I like to give hon. Members some leeway, but the hon. Gentleman is speaking about the Bill rather than the amendment. He is going wide of the amendment. He should have raised these matters on Second Reading. The hon. Gentleman should confine his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obedient to the Chair. However, we are in some difficulty, because I would not have raised this subject had it not been for the Minister's assertion this morning that the timetable was exactly the same as in the 1970s. Are we to have the leeway to refute ministerial statements that are clearly false? However, I get the gist of it and say only that the time scale for this reorganisation began in October 1992, with the publication of a flimsy consultative document which was dreamt up in 12 months at most. The reorganisation is supposed to be complete, with the new authorities in place, by 1 April 1996. This is half the gestation period that was required last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat: the Minister, speaking with the authority of the Scottish Office has made a palpably false statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not use that term. No member of the Committee would issue a false statement in our proceedings. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I want is to have a dispute with you, Mr. Martin, about terms. I think that "economicar is a parliamentary word, so I shall substitute "economical" for "false".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is saying that the Minister did not issue a false statement. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it at that. I do not wish to use any words that are out of order. If I have been out of order, Mr. Martin, I apologise to you as Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point involves the questions that I asked this morning about planning. My proverbial breath was taken away by the Minister's response. If the Minister thinks that those questions are simply matters of detail to be resolved as we go without requiring special attention, he is wrong. Those questions are very far from being matters of detail to the people and planners involved. They are gut questions. The matter of conurbation planning is absolutely central. I hope that the questions will get a substantive answer tonight. If not, I shall ask the same questions, in one form or another time and again, as often as is consistent with order. It might be a good plan for the Minister to arrange to answer those five questions on
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
planning in writing, although an answer in a letter is second best to a substantive answer in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of staff is critical. The Minister was right to say that members of staff are local authorities' main resource. They provide key services to local communities. Often they perform key tasks in very difficult circumstances. The quality of local services depends largely on the skills and dedication of the staff. Some hon. Members are very worried about staff morale in local government. The proposed reorganisation is a great anxiety to all 300,000 local government employees in Scotland. Those people did not ask for reorganisation and they do not want it. Local government staff want a stable and consistent working environment, but instead they face uncertainty, instability and insecurity. As a result, they want the Bill to contain clear commitments about job security, employment continuity and the maintenance of their living standards. Assurances of concern and good will are not enough. The issues are fundamental and need to be tackled in primary legislation. The Minister must respond by giving the guarantees that staff need. Otherwise, there will be a further crisis of morale and motivation that will seriously damage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already asked the Minister some specific questions about the clause. My overriding concern is to secure the job security and salary and conditions protection that staff need during a reorganisation. That concern is shared by my hon. Friends the Members for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), and by all my colleagues. It is also shared by many thousands of people in Scotland. Therefore, I ask why the Minister considers that staff should have less protection in 1994 than in 1993. That cannot be justified. It can lead only to the conclusion that security of employment is not a priority for the Government, as it was in 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred already to clause 9, which gives some protection to staff. Its protection, however, applies to transferred staff only. Without a commitment to transferring all staff, the Minister cannot rely on clause 9 as his response to the question. I note with interest that the wording of clause 9 is taken directly from the TUPE regulations. That implies that the Minister can accept the TUPE principles will apply to reorganisation, but his logic is flawed unless he accepts that the job security and conditions of service all staff in post on 31 March 1996 must be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister again: will he accept that the general principles of the acquired rights directive and the TUPE regulations should apply to the reorganisation of Scottish local government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to raise again the matter of the appointment of senior officials to the new authorities prior to transfer day. Many questions arise. For example, will the appointments be made by open competition, or will ring fencing be applied? My main question, however, is as follows: what protection will be given to staff applying for posts in new authorities when their current remuneration package is better? That is a practical question, and deserves attention. Such practical matters must be dealt with. The proper place to deal with them is in this Committee, and the proper time to do so is here and now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I follow the questions raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) by saying that I am worried about the timetable? The Government seem to be offering an 18-month to a two-year period in which all the crucial matters will be discussed and finalised. That is not an adequate time scale, given that there was a six-year gestation in 1975 for the introduction of the new authorities. The time scale on offer now is very short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personnel and services will be disrupted during the transition. Authorities will operate in parallel in that period and local government officials will be stretched, but—simultaneously—conclusions will be reached about both the general principles and the details of redundancy and staff transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there is no real difference in the intention between the Bill and the amendments. There is a big difference. Clause 8 allows orders to be made for transfer after further consideration on the tightest of timetables. Clause 9 refers to staff after transfer. The staff commission can only give advice. It is up the Secretary of State to issue orders. That process is light years away from any provision in the 1973 Act. There is a fundamental difference of approach between this Bill and the 1973 proposals. Why are such matters not in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there will be no difference in the end product. If that is true, why not retain the 1973 provisions? There should be explicit safeguards for staff. Provisions in the 1973 Bill were established after a great deal of consultation. Why change them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the complexity of merging staff from large units into smaller units, is the timetable adequate to tackle such matters? There is no general precedent in Scotland for such a merger. The Government are leading us into new territory. We have not received an answer to the information technology problems, which go to the heart of the way in which local authorities operate. The points about early retirement or redundancy have not been answered. The Minister has not adequately responded to points about the effects of the measure on staffing standards, the local economy and individual families. Those issues will be decided later by ministerial orders in the tightest possible timetable. The amendments could provide the answers the those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the Government expect the 18-month to two-year period to unfold? What timetable will local authorities receive for the transition period? The answer would provide a pointer to the Government's thinking. Everyone could then decide whether the timetable was realistic. Staff matters are at the heart of the system. If the system is to work well, decisions about staff must be made correctly. The timetable is very tight. That is unfair to local government. How does the Minister believe that local authorities will cope? How does he expect them to perform within the timetable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke this morning about estimates in the Pieda study of the possibilities for Central region. The Minister is still considering how he will suggest to the House that boundaries should be drawn. Pieda estimated that two extra staff members would be required in a two-council solution. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to calculations based on a three-council solution for the districts. I hope that that solution will not tempt the
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must refrain from reading newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Conservative Ministers had read the 	<i>Local Government Chronicle</i> for the past 10 or 15 years, they would not have proposed such a terrible destruction of local government in Scotland. Those who take an interest in local government know that the proposals could damage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers proposed in amendments Nos. 90 and 91 are needed. No sudden loss of staff will occur. The Pieda estimate for the three-council solution in Central region is that there will be a net recruitment requirement for 210 staff. That requirement would cost £5.2 million a year. If we consider the calculations that Touche Ross and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy made, there would be a further net cost of £55 million to local government. The small authorities will need extra staff unless they are forced into the marketplace, which would mean the destruction of local government as we know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was comment this morning about which Scottish council was leading the race in the lunatic Olympics in terms of what was being done to staff. People should look seriously at what is happening in Stirling distict council, which seems to be nudging ahead of even Kyle and Carrick, by striking a budget last week which will lead to 18 immediate redundancies. That budget has benefited from an increase in revenue support grant from the Government, which will enable it to cut its council tax. It is clear from that and what happened at Kyle and Carrick that some councils would like to target staff as the losers. Once again, that demonstrates the need for amendments Nos. 90 and 91 to safeguard staff from such proposals. Not only the staff in Stirling would be affected, because the council has proposed a 200 per cent. to 300 per cent. increase in leisure charges. The scenario frightens people. Having seen the first glimmer of the knife that is held over services by some local authorities, staff are afraid that it will fall on their necks if the Government's market-driven model gets its way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is expected to take a lead and say that staff are not under threat. He can do that not just with words but by accepting our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have been extremely angry at the farcical nature of the Bill. We sat through a debate on boundaries and were dismayed by what is being proposed. We have had a debate on costs, which heightened our concern about the reckless nature of this reorganisation, but, on clause 8 and amendments Nos. 90 and 91, the Government are simply not listening to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
plea of 300,000 people that they must be treated with fairness and dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why, as my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow asked, are the Government unwilling to provide the same assurances in this Bill as they gave when the 1973 Act was put on the statute book? People are not asking for favours, they ask only for the same treatment as was given 20 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the safeguards that the Government had built into the Bill to cope with the transfer of staff. Let me repeat those flimsy safeguards. In the first instance, they will be influenced by the Secretary of State making orders. That means that 300,000 employees at best will be in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains the qualification
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision"</p></blockquote>
to cover new authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which groups of employees, or particular employees, are to be transferred".</p></blockquote>
First, there is a general power for the Secretary of State, and, secondly, there is a power that allows him to select groups, or particular individuals. The provision continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order prescribe a general rule or rules by which the transfer of employees, or of specified groups"</p></blockquote>
can take place. It provides that local authorities will be able to get together to make arrangements on which, again, the Secretary of State will have to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are not safeguards. This disgraceful clause provides no assurance whatever to those 300,000 employees that they will have a future in the new system of local government. It is preposterous for the Government to argue as the Minister has done, that our proposal in any way matches the flimsy, shabby details in clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the matter is that the Opposition want written into the Bill a guarantee that each existing employee will be transferred to the new set-up. Is that too much to ask, or will the Committee make a decision today that will go back to Scotland, and simply say to every employee that every job is at risk in the reorganisation? That will be the implication of our decision if the Government reject our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even worse, if that is not bad enough, is the fact that this mess may end up in the courts. Scottish employees face being at the mercy of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will have power to define orders, group, particular groups, and local authorities. That will create uncertainty, but, to add insult to injury, we face a situation in which, through the TUPE regulations and the acquired rights directive, recourse to the courts will be necessary. Is not it disgraceful that this legislature wishes to treat the Scottish local authorities staff in that manner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

It beggars belief that the Government cannot accept two simple amendments that would avoid court difficulties and include in the Bill the guarantees that those staff seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in Scotland, least of all local authority staff, wants the shambles that we call the reform of local
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
government. It is impprtant to send a loud and clear message to those employees that we appreciate what they have contributed and that, in the crisis that lies ahead in the coming two years, their interests will be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want anyone to have any doubt about what the Government will be doing if they vote against our amendments. They will tell employees in Scotland "We simply don't care. The market will prevail and, once we get this shabby Bill onto the statute book, it will be a free-for-all." It will be left to the Secretary of State, the marketplace and some of these jumped-up new single-tier authorities to deal with staff. We await the Minister's response with interest. Without satisfactory and detailed assurances, we shall vote on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a load of nonsense from the hon. Member for Fife, Central. Obviously I wasted my time earlier going carefully and objectively through the detailed consequences of the amendments and of the Bill as drafted. I thought that I was being helpful, but it is clear that Opposition Members did not listen to a word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interestingly elongated debate for some time. Questions have been asked repeatedly, despite my having answered them in the preceding debate. One question, from the hon. Member for Linlithgow, was genuinely new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked me about appointments to shadow authorities on reduced terms. Clause 13 allows for the preparation of detriment compensation schemes in appropriate circumstances. We shall consult COSLA and others about the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the answer to my question will be yes, but may I ask the Minister whether he has cleared with the Treasury the whole question of detriment compensation, because it can be exceedingly expensive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is inconceivable that I would make statements without being fairly sure that the Treasury was content with what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my assurances on clauses 8 and 9. Clause 8 deals with the substantive issues of transfer; clause 9 relates to the protection of existing terms and conditions. As regards the Bill's timing, I repeat that the timetabling for both the shadow authorities and the new authorities is the same as at the previous reorganisation. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon Member for Fife, Central says that there was a consensus. As I keep saying, the boundaries were changed substantially during the Committee stages of the 1973 Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The parallel is invalid. Not only had there been lengthy debates from the time the Wheatley commission reported, and an essential consensus on the necessity and desirability of the reform itself—at that time it was reform—but a considerable amount of work had been done as a consquence of that

	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
consensus until the point at which the shadow authorities were created. There is no parallel in this respect. The Government are forcing through a measure that is unwanted and unnecessary and which has not been subjected to an independent review. The Minister cannot draw a parallel because there was a continuing debate about some of the boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In respect of the amendments, the parallel is exact. The new authorities will have the same length of time after the Bill is enacted as I told the Committee. For example, for the 1975 reorganisation, when, according to hon. Members the timetable was perfect, the relevant compensation regulations to which hon. Members referred were not made until June 1975, when the new authorities were up and running. I do not accept hon. Members' criticisms of the time scale. I explained the technical difficulties involved in the amendments. Conservative Members regard the staff of local government in Scotland as its best and most important resource. The staff in local government will not be impressed when they read the report of this lengthy debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not have grasped this properly. Is the Minister saying that there is no problem about time scale? His comparisons of the 1970s and the 1990s are factually wrong. Is he saying that Scottish Office Ministers have no anxieties about the pressures of the time scale that local government will face?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that there will be no problems. There will be problems: matters to be decided and resolved. The time scale will, for all practical purposes, be the same as the previous time scale. We are ahead in setting up the advisory committee and I believe that the time scale will be met. The Secretary of State has the necessary reserve powers to ensure that it will be kept to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will not take long. As the Government have rejected the amendments, I draw the Minister's attention to clause 8(4). A systematic approach to the Bill would be to go through each order-making process and table amendments which would turn negative procedures into affirmative procedures. I have been accused of having a fetish about this aspect of parliamentary procedure and I suppose that there are worse fetishes. It is relatively harmless and does not get one into the tabloid press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that, as drafted, clause 8(4) submits the important orders dealing with the subject matter of our previous debate to a negative process. That means that the Government can table orders during the recess if they wish. It is then left to the precarious and difficult procedure whereby hon. Members have to table prayers for debates if they are unhappy about the orders. Clause 8 would be much more bearable if the Minister were prepared to consider the possibility of tabling amendments to make the orders subject to affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I decided not to table a series of amendments because I accept that some of the orders, which are minor in nature, could be dealt with by negative procedure. Staff protection orders, however, are particularly important
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
and it would not cost the Government much to redraft this part of the Bill to reassure members of Committee that, without let or hindrance, fear or favour, procedural debates could be held on the orders under the affirmative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still anxious about the appointment of senior officials before the transfer date. It may be an oversight but the Minister did not answer the question whether the appointments would be made after open competition or by ring fencing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) in relation to another part of the Bill. He will understand if I approach his charming request with caution. There could be a considerable number of orders under clause 8 and the hon. Gentleman will recognise that we are following precedent in the way in which we approach this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Someone is speaking softly and some of us are paying great attention.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is much noise from both sides of the Committee. When any hon. Member is addressing the Committee, it is courtesy that he should be given a proper hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sums up my position towards the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the question of ring fencing and open competition is to be left to the advice of Robert Peggie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Authorities themselves will have to take final decisions on individual staffing, but we shall be looking to the staff commission for advice on that particular matter.

	<div class='clause'>Clause 10</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONTINUITY OF EMPLOYMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could speak about clause 10, passing over the fact that the Opposition have just voted to delete from the Bill all the protection for employees contained in clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 is a more technical clause. I am glad to reassure Opposition Members that it repeats provisions of the 1973 Act. It provides, in certain circumstances, for continuity of employment over and above what would normally be available to local authority employees, for local authority staff who are recruited or re-employed by a new council. The 1973 Act contained a similar provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing legislation ensures that where a local authority employee moves to a new job with another council without receiving a redundancy payment, the previous period of service continues to be taken into account for the purpose of calculating future redundancy payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 extends that provision so that periods of service with the previous authority will count towards all contractual matters that depend on length of service and not just redundancy pay. Examples of the contractual matters concerned include the right to claim unfair dismissal and maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A provision of this nature is not, of course, needed for the vast majority of staff transferred to the new councils by orders under clause 8. The contracts of those staff continue unbroken by virtue of clause 9—which has, happily, scraped through the Committee to provide staff with reassurance. Clause 10 is designed to apply to staff whose contracts have been broken, either by virtue of the fact that they have lost their previous jobs because of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
reorganisation but have been re-employed before becoming eligible for redundancy, or, perhaps, because they have chosen to accept a new job in a shadow authority before the vesting day on 1 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause offers local authority staff security over and above that currently provided in statute. I do not think—though perhaps my opinions on such matters are not borne out by the debates—that the clause can be other than reasonably welcome to both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the Minister's remark about clause 9, some Opposition Members would still like a legal opinion—with a view to the matter possibly being raised again on Report—as to whether it deals only with the continuity of employment of staff who are transferred and not with the substantive issue of transfer. There may be great difficulty about the matter. My hon. Friend, if I may call him such, the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, seems to assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says, "Absolutely." Fortified in that opinion, I register that there is a difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 also presents a difficulty—the actuarial minefield of enhanced pension rights. My question is simple. I asked previously whether a provision had been cleared by the Treasury, and I was assured that it had. Has this been cleared by the Government actuary? Mr. Batho says no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any problem at all about clause 10. We had full consultations with all the Departments that are involved before clause 10 reached the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there have been full consultations, has the problem of enhanced pension rights been taken care of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that there is a problem. Clause 10 simply repeats the safeguards that the 1973 Act contained. It continues the safeguards for a limited group of employees in the present reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, in the Government's view, all local authority employees can sleep easily in their beds without worrying about their pension rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have told the Committee, it is not envisaged that clause 10 will apply to all local government employees. Clearly, the overwhelming majority of staff will be affected by clauses 8 and 9, not by clause 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would restrict the power of the Secretary of State to designate an advisory body on pay. The clause can be described as political. It cannot be substantiated by anything that happened between 1973 and 1975. It is mischievous in intent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that the advisory body should be set up only with the agreement of the local authority associations. Moreover, it would render it impossible to set up a new body for the purpose. Our contention is that if the Government believe that this politically motivated clause should be implemented, it would be better that that be done in consultation with the local authority association, which knows more than the Secretary of State about what is happening in local government. The amendment would also ensure that existing institutions, such as the staff commission, would be used. That would be preferable to setting up a new body, whose powers could be draconian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the relevant provisions in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, as do the notes on clauses prepared by the Scottish Office, although the notes observe that the provision was not used. However, our advice is that the note on clause 11 is incorrect. The Secretary of State designated the employers' side of Scottish council staff for the purpose. No order was required under the 1973 Act, and officers involved in the process have concluded that the power served no useful purpose. It was invoked in a very small number of cases, despite the wide-spread accusation of massive rises in salaries in that period and of the feather-bedding of substantial posts in local government.

The facts of the 1973–75 experience cast doubt on the structure of the clause. It would have been acceptable if the Minister had commented on the fear that reorganisation of staff and local authorities would be complex. The clause mentions an advisory body for the pay of existing employees. Is that another attack on local authorities and local government employees? The Opposition are sick and tired of the innuendo in every attack. Local authorities do an excellent job. They do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
support reorganisation. If this crazy Bill is passed, they will have to cope with the consequences. It would add insult to injury to suggest that they could not cope with pressures that emanated from the transition. The Opposition are being reasonably charitable. We say that, if there is to be an advisory body let it be formed through discussion and let it be an organisation that already exists in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may take the opportunity to explain some of the thinking behind the clause. I expect most councils to take a responsible and careful approach to staff remuneration during the transition period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister claims that he expects most councils to behave responsibly. Thus, he implies that a minority of councils will not behave responsibly. He should substantiate such allegations and give the Committee his reasons for suspecting that some councils may behave irresponsibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made no such allegations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said "most councils".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully expect most councils to take a responsible and careful approach to staff remuneration during the transitional period. I shall explain why it is reasonable for the Government to take the powers for which the clause provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some employees will reasonably receive increased remuneration for accepting more important or senior posts in the new councils. However, it is incumbent on us to ensure that the Bill provides reasonable protection against a council that offers a few employees large and unjustified salary increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new provision. A similar power was taken during the previous reorganisation in Scotland. It was acknowledged then that such a safeguard was necessary. We hope that we shall not have to use it. I hope that the Committee agrees that it would be unfair not only to local taxpayers but to other council employees if a few people received substantial pay increases for no defensible reason. It would be wrong if the vast majority of staff had to watch a few employees appearing to receive preferential treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has been deliberately drafted to restrict its application to specific events over a specific period. Unlike in 1973, the Secretary of State will be obliged to consult local authority associations before he sets up the advisory body. I repeat: there was no such obligation in the 1973 measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the advisory body would have to take into account the levels of pay recommended by national negotiating bodies. It would not be able to have its own ideas on appropriate salary levels for employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and most importantly, the provisions of the clause are purely transitional. It would cease to have effect after 1 April 1997. The clause is designed for a very limited purpose and, I believe, has adequate safegurds inherent in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the arguments of the hon. member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister taken out similar powers over the proposed water boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a completely different part of the Bill. When we deal with the water provisions those matters can be discussed. Under this clause we are talking about local authorities generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would severely undermine the deterrent effect of the clause. As drafted, the amendment would require the Secretary of State to obtain the agreement of every local authority association in existence in Scotland before he could set up an advisory body. That is not sensible. It would mean that any local authority association, including the Association of Highland District Councils or a consortia of authorities established for the purpose of gaining European funding, would be able to veto any proposal. Even if the majority of local authority associations agreed on the matter, it would take only one to block the move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reassure Opposition Members that the clause already provides for appropriate local authority associations to be consulted—we are obviously referring to COSLA. That obligation is additional to the earlier provision in the 1973 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible to interpret the authorities from which the Minister will seek information to be those authorities with which he fancies have a chat? Is it possible that individual authorities will happen to have the same preference as the Minister? He has already said that he has met Kyle and Carrick district council, which seems to be trying to win the loony Olympics in local government services. That scenario could be repeated. There would be no cohesion; authorities would not be speaking with one mind, it would depend on how they saw things. It would be a tautological meeting and the Minister would hear from someone he knows who would say what he wanted to hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to Kyle and Carrick. I repeat what I said earlier. I had a meeting about local government reform with my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and the majority Conservative councillors on Kyle and Carrick council. I had a meeting on precisely the same basis with the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), the majority on Cumnock and Doon Valley district council and the Labour minority members of Kyle and Carrick. We discussed the same agenda. That is a reasonable basis on which to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for consultation, we are talking about an advisory body and I can give an assurance that the obvious body that we would consult on this matter would be COSLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will come on to this point, but I am sure that many of my constituents will welcome the fact that the Bill provides protection, because the last time round there was widespread concern, even if it was not justified, that excessive salary increases were being awarded. This measure will provide protection for local authorities as well as for ratepayers. Will my hon. Friend say what will trigger the setting up of the body and who will determine when a salary increase is worth examining? Will it be one person or several?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should emphasise to my hon. Friend that the advisory body would need to consult closely with the national negotiating bodies, to which I referred earlier. The process would start with the setting up of the body—a complaint could be triggered by a member of the public, a negotiating body or group of people—followed by the consideration of the evidence on merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention was responsible for the task during the previous reorganisation. At present the Government have no view about whether a new body would have to be set up to take on the task. Nevertheless, it is important that the Government retain the flexibility to set up a new body should existing bodies such as the convention, the accounts commission or the staff commission prove unsuitable or not want to take on the task. The staff commission, for example, may think it inappropriate to take on the task in view of its largely advisory role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is limited, but necessary to provide a useful protection to local authority employees and to local taxpayers. Should an irresponsible council choose to use the reorganisation to award unreasonable salary increases to staff, the safeguard will be widely welcomed. I do not like the amendment, but hope that the clause will commend itself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to repeat my question to the Minister. He wants safeguards against what are in his view large salary increases in public authorities. Does that logic apply to water boards? Does he intend to apply a similar mechanism to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your indulgence, Mr. Martin, for discussing another part of the Bill when responding to the hon. Gentleman. The terms and conditions of employees of water boards will be subject to approval by the Secretary of State. Separately and differently, we are taking a necessary safeguard to ensure that unreasonable salary increases are not awarded to particular local authority employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to persist, but I am anxious that members of the public will find it difficult to discover what new salaries are compared to old salaries. Will the body be actively scrutinising the salaries of employees taken from existing authorities to new authorities? Will it ask, as a matter of routine, that authorities submit full lists of salaries, before and after reorganisation, so that it can comment? Otherwise, it might be difficult for the public to trigger an inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm to my hon. Friend that an individual member of the public could trigger an inquiry. The precise remit of the body in terms of how proactive it might be will be determined by the Secretary of State, but we envisage the body—if and when it is set up—having a role that is not solely reactive. I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite alarmed. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside asked an important question, but I am not at all persuaded by the answer. Frankly, I fear witch hunts against individuals in local authorities. I am searching my mind for any comparable situation. Members of the public can trigger off—to use the apt
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
words of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside—an investigation into the salary level of a chief executive or senior officer. What comparative experience do the Government have in doing that? It seems to be opening Pandora's box and is an action fraught with danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government remember what happened last time, in what are portrayed as several, quite unjustifiable pay increases? When studied more closely, there may have been justification for them. I am not a believer in the idea of irresponsible local authorities. When have local authorities been irresponsible in such circumstances? Usually, there is another side to the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975, who was to blame? One can argue the toss as to whether it was the Labour Government or what happened with the Barber Budget. There was a strong rate of inflation and the country had, at one point, over 25 per cent. inflation—we were almost into hyper-inflation. In that context, there were large salary increases. Whether they were unjustifiable was a matter of argument because often those who got the increases were being promoted from comparatively minor jobs to important jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the comparison of members of the public triggering off such an investigation in any other field? Is it all about what was purported to have happened in the 1970s?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start by referring to the notes on clauses that were helpfully made available by the Government to members of the Committee. Opposition Members obviously do not know what is in the Government's mind when they draft legislation or what the arguments will be in defence of that legislation, until the Minister reads the brief that has been prepared for him by his civil servants. We would appreciate a whole raft of Opposition civil servants to brief us on the alternative arguments, which would make our lives considerably easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to go on the notes and clauses. The note on this particular clause states that a "reserve power" has been given to the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is thought to be a necessary reserve power because of the fear that, during the period of local government reorganisation, individual local authorities will take the opportunity of the confusion and change that arises from that reorganisation to award excessive pay increases to their particular employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had such allegations during debates in the Committee. This morning, the hon. Member for Tayside, North explained that when he used the term "jobs for the boys" that is what he meant. Fife regional council had taken advance of the situation to award excessive pay increases to their employees, arising out of the reorganisation in 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is passed unamended, the Secretary of State will be able to set up an advisory committee if such an allegation is made this time around. Based on the advice given by the committee, he will then be able to direct a local authority to reduce the remuneration that it has awarded to its employees in that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses are useful. They refer to what happened in 1973 and 1975 when a similar reserve power existed. Naturally, Government have to take such a reserve power, but the power was never used following
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
reorganisation in 1975. If we ask why the power was not used, we get the obvious answer. It was never used because there was never any abuse by local authorities. Excessive pay awards were not made to local authority employees. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow explained why there might have appeared to be abuse, given the huge salary increases that occurred at that time. However, when they are investigated, they are seen as justified either in terms of the rate of inflation at that time or of the increased responsibilities that local authority officers took on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) referred to concern about excessive pay increases. He admitted that that concern was unjustified. The Government are trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill. They are trying to pretend that the Secretary of State needs the vital reserve power on the grounds that the last time reorganisation took place, Labour local authorities in Scotland paid their officers unjustified huge increases. However, the Government cannot provide a single example of a local authority taking advantage of the situation to make an excessive pay increase to an employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses refer to the previous reserve power. They state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the event, it was not used. The clause has been included, however, to meet concerns which have been expressed in relation to other organisations".</p></blockquote>
What are the other organisations that have caused the concern that forces the Government to include the clause in the Bill? Perhaps they are the water boards. Perhaps the Government fear that the quangos that they set-up to run water services in Scotland will take advantage and award themselves and the people appointed to them by the Secretary of State huge salary increases. Given the past record of quangos, that may be what the Government expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, the Government may fear that the joint boards will exploit the situation. I refer to recent events at Rover. When Rover was taken over by BMW, I believe that its chairman awarded himself £10 million. That caused some concern among Labour Members even though it did not seem to worry Conservative Members. The Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is not a matter for me."—	<i>[OfficialReport,</i> 8 February 1994; Vol. 237, 	<i>c.</i> 140.]</p></blockquote>
He suggested that if people want to exploit the takeover of Rover by BMW by raking off money and by lining their own pockets with gold, that is a matter for the private sector. We do not accept that view. Nor do we accept that anyone in the public sector would line his pockets in the way that happens in the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I recall it, the Prime Minister said that it was not a matter for him.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only bought mine two years ago, so I cannot give that assurance. When Rover was a nationalised concern, I was a poorly paid teacher and could not afford to buy a car of any description because of the public pay policies pursued by Tory Governments. I was kept on a low income, so I had to get the bus to St. Saviour's high school in Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the notes on clauses refer to quangos and to the considerable public disquiet about some of them? The notes on clauses might reflect concern inside the Scottish Office that some new quangos will follow that model. The example of the Welsh Development Agency must have put the fear of death into the Scottish Office. The agency scandalously misused money and gave large pay-offs to individual members of staff. The Secretary of State for Wales—one of the funny-money men into whose clan the Minister fits so well—had to apologise to the House and to promise that that would never happen again. Could that be the motive behind the notes on clauses and the reason for the Government's apprehension? That iniquity stems not from local authorities but from the current Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. That is the only commonsense interpretation of the notes on clauses, which concede that there are no examples of local government taking the opportunity of reorganisation to award it or its employees excessive pay increases. The hon. Members for Tayside, North and for Ayr could not give a single example of abuse or of when the reserve powers in the 1973 Act were employed. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) has given an example—quangos—that might lead the Government to fear that there will be abuse this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the quangoisation—if I can put it like that—of Scotland, quangos have repeatedly awarded themselves huge, unjustified increases from taxpayers' money. The Bill will create a new raft of quangos and of joint boards, so it may be necessary this time not just to take but to use
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
reserve powers to try to control those quangos. I see that the Minister is edging about in his seat—does he want to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was about to conclude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no. I am far from completing my speech. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I missed what the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), said. If he wants to intervene, he can tell the whole Committee what he said, but obviously he has decided to go back to sleep and not to interfere further with the Committee, which is probably just as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that he expects most local authorities to behave responsibly. That implies that he expects some local authorities not to behave responsibly. I asked him to justify that, but he could not answer. He simply evaded the question and went on to another matter. The past 20 years have shown that all local authorities in Scotland behave responsibly and, on that record, cannot be expected not to behave responsibly. The Minister should not concoct allegations by using the word "most". He should say that he expects all local authorities to behave responsibly, as they have in the past and will in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the clause was necessary to provide protection against a council that might make excessive increases, but did not say where in Scotland such a council might be found. Perhaps he knows more about Tory councils than I do; perhaps he was thinking of new councils, such as Kyle and Carrick, East Renfrewshire or Stirling, which are likely to abuse the provisions and make massive pay awards to their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside raised an important issue when he questioned how the process would be triggered and when the Secretary of State would take.on the reserve powers for which the Bill provides. The Secretary of State has said that an individual could be the trigger. It is highly unlikely that an individual council tax payer would trigger off that process. However, a group such as the Freedom Association might do so. Such right-wing groups which have got it in for Labour like nothing better than to create a diversion to do with a local government scandal in a Labour-controlled council. The Secretary of State might be asked to invoke his reserve powers to set up the new authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that commerce and industry will have any input in this respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my experience of local government in the Dundee and Tayside areas that commerce and industry are most supportive of local authorities. They work closely with Labour-controlled authorities in Dundee and Tayside and are happy to do so. I would not expect commerce and industry to be involved in this issue because they are not party political; they do not want to gain party-political advantage from embarrassing the Labour administration on a council. However, there are groups who do. They will take advantage of the proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
mechanism to try to embarrass Labour councils for party-political reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making too much of the party-political point. Industry and commerce might well be involved if there were an excessive increase in salaries because that would reflect on salaries throughout the area and thus affect their recruitment policies. It would not necessarily be a matter for conflict with the council if businesses raised the matter of salaries paid by the new authority. That is why I asked my hon. Friend the Minister whether the body would scrutinise the new salaries on a regular basis. My hon. Friend answered that it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman expressed his genuine concern to the Minister. He was not in the Committee when I said that there was no evidence that local authorities will behave in the way suggested. There is no evidence that business and commerce in any part of Scotland expect local authorities to pay their employees excessive salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that local government salaries may affect the general level of salaries in an area. The biggest employers in Dundee are the local authorities. The Government are anxious to dismantle them in Scotland and to put their services out to competitive tender so that salaries in local authorities can be dragged down to the private sector level. One of the hon. Gentleman's motivations for supporting the Bill is that he hopes that local government employees will be paid less in future. He wants their salaries to go down to the market level, which is determined by the fact that 3 or 4 million people are out of work, which in turn pushes down wages. The Labour party knows that that is what the Tories are all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must contradict the hon. Gentleman. The Conservative party is about attracting good styles of industry to this country which can pay good wages. There are numerous examples of such industries in Scotland. That is the platform of Conservative policy, unlike that of the Labour party, which adds costs to businesses—costs which must be taken into consideration in deciding the price of products. That in turn reduces the wages available for the work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr, as usual, speaks awful nonsense when defending the Conservative Government's record on wages and conditions for workers. Their economic strategy is directed at driving down wages and making conditions worse. They do not say that openly; they call it "flexibility in the labour market" and "making Britain competitive in relation to Europe". What they really mean is, "Let's drive down the wages and conditions of workers in this country because that is how we will maximise profits for the private sector."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This measure is part of the strategy of attacking the public sector because it protects wages and conditions. Ask the workers in Dundee if they would rather work as a typist, for example, for the private sector or for the local authority. People would rather work for local authorities because they have better wages and conditions than the private sector. That is what angers Conservative Members: they do not like the fact that local authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
employees receive better wages protection and terms and conditions of employment than anyone else. Local authorities are good employers who look after their staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to the point about the trigger mechanism that I was trying to make before I got distracted by Conservative Members. This does not apply only to organisations such as the Freedom Association. Conservative and minority groups in various local authorities will be able to use this mechanism to seek to embarrass the majority Labour administration in an area. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow hit the nail on the head when he said that a witch hunt could be mounted against local government officers. Someone's salary increase may be completely justified in terms of increased and different responsibilities but, because of this mechanism, he can be exposed to what amounts to a witch hunt if a minority group in the area tells the Secretary of State that his increase is unjustified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is despicable. I do not mind the Government taking reserve powers as long as they recognise that they are reserve powers, and as long as they put on record their belief that there will be no need to use them. But the Government are virtually encouraging irresponsible individuals across Scotland to mount the kind of witch hunt against local government officers to which my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made great play of the fact that the amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult all local authority associations in Scotland. He mentioned, among others, the Association of Highland District Councils. He knows very well that the intention of the amendment is simply to ensure that the Secretary of State seeks the agreement of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. If the amendment needs a technical change to give expression to that intention, I am sure that we would be prepared to withdraw it and reintroduce it in clearer terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not expect the Secretary of State to consult everybody associated with local government in Scotland. We are talking about the main local authority associations—the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. The difference between the Opposition and the Government is that we do not want the Secretary of State simply to consult local authorities in Scotland; he should also reach agreement with them. There is a world of difference. The Government consulted on the poll tax but they did not listen to anything that was said. They went ahead with it against all the advice given during the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that if the Secretary of State ever had to use his reserve powers, although he would certainly consult the local authority associations, he would then ignore their advice and go ahead and do what he wanted to do all along. That is the Government's track record—they consult on everything and listen to nothing. They go ahead and do what they were going to do in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that my point of view is well practised. It has been well learnt over the past 15 years. The Government do not listen; they have never listened. We are asking them, at least in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
context of this Bill, to listen, for once, to what the representatives of the people of Scotland are saying. The Government's madcap scheme will bring nothing but grief, not only to them but to those who depend on local authority services across Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) designate such existing body as he considers appropriate; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) establish a new body"</p></blockquote>
to advise him. Who will make up the new body? Which organisation would be appropriate to take on such a role? The clause appears to be setting up yet another quango to operate in the sphere of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a general concern about the Government's approach. There is an inbuilt assumption that some local authorities will be financially irresponsible, and that reserve powers will be required. The clause provides that a member of the public can trigger off an advisory committee investigation into local authorities' transitional salaries and wages, but that is not the case with water boards' equally transitional salaries and wages. Both are public bodies, but I fail to detect the principle involved. Quangos cannot be called to account; they are not elected or accountable to the public. They cannot be called to account by such an advisory body, but duly elected local authorities will be called to account. I cannot detect the principle involved in the Government asking for an extra reserve power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an in-built assumption against local authorities. That is an example of double standards. The Government propose a further quango in the form of the advisory body to oversee elected local government. Who or what does the Minister envisage asking to undertake the task? Why the difference in principle? Why ask another quango to investigate a duly elected public authority when he will not investigate a non-elected quango? There are enough quangos in Scotland to keep us going without an additional one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find, like everyone else, that the vagueness of the clause is something to be concerned about. The clause deals with remuneration and sorts out the mess that has been made. People feel that somehow in 1973 there were jobs for the boys and lashings of loot to be handed out. My hon. Friends the Members for Linlithgow and for Dundee, East, however, mentioned the inflation rates and cash estimates of that time. If they are studied, it is clear that the real value of salaries—job for job, responsibility for responsibility—did not change much between 1973 and 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that local government became a little more attractive to people who considered themselves as managers in private or public sector industry. Many of the people who I have met, such as Robert Black from the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, who is the chief executive of Tayside and was chief executive of Stirling district and a senior manager in Strathclyde, bring with them a force of intellect that would be at home in any boardroom in Britain. There are many others of similar talent who thought in 1974 and 1975 that local government was an attractive outlet for their talents. They were paid sensible remuneration, which at that time, was not thought excessive. People got the idea, however, that everyone, particularly politicians, was lashing around
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
salaries to their favoured sons and daughters. That was because of the hysteria that was caused at the time. The impression was created that local government was somehow a sector in which people received salaries that were larger than their duties should bring. That impression has lasted since the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said in a vague way that they might establish a new body, and, by putting it like that, they are giving a hostage to fortune to the public. They seem to be telling the public that it is all right to continue to have a negative view of local government. When the Minister talks to and about local government representatives on a non-political platform he says much that is positive, but the clause is vaguely suggesting to the public that the Government might need another body to stop people doing what we know they did in 1974 and 1975. That is why the Minister should consider the amendment seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have been happier if the amendment had included COSLA, the Scottish Joint National Council or the Scottish Council for Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical Staff, and had specified who and what the body was and stated how it would fit into local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can demonstrate that we could have confidence in the advisory body, if that is what it is to be, if it was an existing body of which people know. If it is to be a new body—unspecified, ephemeral and to be feared—it could be a worry and might do great damage to local government credibility and the quality of the staff who will commit themselves in the next period to putting their careers, minds and skills into local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us think about what is likely to happen. In some cases the regions are to be broken up. If that happens there will either be large authorities—if the Minister persists—such as North Lanarkshire, which will combine Cumbernauld, Monklands district and Motherwell district, or regions such as Fife will be unitary authorities. Whatever happens, they will be large authorities—not as large as Strathclyde now, but large authorities that will take on substantial additional responsibilities. Districts will take on regional responsibilities that are greater and more onerous than the district authorities have hitherto taken on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that in that case talented managers will be needed—people who are creative and thorough, of the calibre of MBA holders. I even know of small authorities employing such talent. Certainly the larger regions now look for people of that kind. To employ that kind of person, however, an authority will have to pay substantially more than a district officer is now paid. People are worried that the advisory body that the Secretary of State may set up may have the specific purpose of holding down remuneration rates at that level of local government, thereby denying local government the talent that it needs. That will put people off local government as a career. If the action is seen to be taken for political reasons it will set a new era of local government off on the wrong footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State might argue that the establishment of a new body is simply a form of fallback and that it will not really be used. He might say that there
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
are organisations in which he has confidence and to which he speaks regularly. He is always telling us that when he dishes out the revenue support grant he consults COSLA on the formula and that everything is very well done. He is not willing to state, however, that he would use that organisation as the advisory body. Why not? It would make sense for him to do that. It would be better for everyone—for us in Committee, for Parliament when it considers the Bill on Report, and for local authorities and their employees who are looking with trepidation to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other scenario is that very small authorities will be given hugely increased responsibilities. The brain power and talent needed to manage them is probably greater than that required in a large authority of two or three districts or a region such as Fife, where expertise already exists. Such small authorities will have to bring in people who are capable of dealing with all the difficulties that we have discussed in Committee—the lack of resourcing, of funding, of school and social work facilities. Those problems will be much more difficult to manage than they would be for a large authority in which economies of scale could be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that senior middle managers from regions will want to take on the highest responsibilities in the new small authorities without adequate remuneration. I think that because of the difficulties that those authorities will have, they will want decent payment. When Robert Black, for example, left Strathclyde to gain experience as a chief executive, he took on a district for a few years. It was a challenge to him and honed his skills and, as we mentioned earlier, he moved on to Tayside. I do not think that if such moves are seen as permanent, however, people will take those posts for anything less than would go to senior middle management in a region now. There is a worry that someone, as yet unspecified, is waiting in the wings, with a possible political purpose, to do the Secretary of State's bidding and challenge the remuneration offered by small authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who have moved from senior positions in regions have conserved salaries. Little has been heard about such salaries. People will not suddenly move to a region and decide not to five in the same house or pay the same bills. The bills and, in a way, the lifestyle will be set. I know of nothing in the clause that would allow conserved salaries to be challenged by the new advisory body. It is a tremendous worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East told the Committee that he had been a teacher in a former life, as I have. Teaching is an honourable profession although it is not always full of honourable people. I heard that the brother-in-law of the Minister of State, Department of Employment, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) was a teacher, but left the profession because as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, it was so badly paid and going nowhere. Local government workers—many of them very talented people—who may be faced with the offer of a redundancy package, a pension, and the chance to go to the private sector, or into some voluntary sector where they may receive greater reward and fewer attacks of the kind that the Conservative party customarily makes on local government, will say, "It is not worth it. If I cannot have a job in a large authority, I shall not go to a small authority that is without resources. I shall go." The sad fact about so many professions,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
including local authority employment, is that very talented, well-educated and highly skilled people leave public services and retire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a fair point. Is he aware that in Tayside regional council, which administers a population of 400,000, senior positions receive substantial salaries and attract the finest talent, but that when the new authorities come into being, Dundee district council, or Dundee council, will have a population of only 150,000 and will be unable to afford the salaries commensurate with such posts? Does he agree that the result will be a sort of brain drain from such areas as Dundee and Tayside to bigger authorities in the west, which is the reverse of what has happened recently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point was very well made. My worry is that people will leave local government altogether and accept retirement packages. They seek management quality and creativity that the Minister has probably commended many times in private when he has examined various schemes. I am sure that other Ministers at the Scottish Office with responsibility for local authority matters have come across those talents many times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) was recently in my constituency, an area in which a partnership has been struck between Scottish Homes and the local authority. There is no doubt that talent and management skills are necessary to put such packages together and tackle many problems in all services. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East that we face a genuine problem. A person offering his creative talents to a small authority cannot be sure that some advisory body, whose membership he does not know, will suddenly step in and pull the salary offer from under his feet, advising him to take the job at a lower salary and reduce his lifestyle, or get out. That would be the problem with an unknown body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have wondered why the Minister has not specified the type of advisory body the Government have in mind. It worries me. I am by nature a suspicious person, especially after 15 years of the present Conservative Government, who have betrayed every promise and ideal that they propounded at the elections. They have betrayed us on their one solid plank, tax. If they can do that, they can betray us on anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not know what type of body will be established and consulted, he is asking everyone here to buy a pig in a poke. It is nonsense to bring to Parliament in a Bill a clause that provides that the Government may designate an existing body or, invent a new one. The amendment seeks a more concrete provision. If it makes no difference what type of body there will be—if the Minister decides that it will be one that supports and does not threaten, one that will just help out, ease things along, and oil the wheels—why does he not specify, say, COSLA or one of its salary committees? That would instill much more confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the advisory body shall consult and seek information"</p></blockquote>
and it goes on to say that the Secretary of State may direct which local authorities will be consulted. Let us suppose that my worst scenario is correct, that it does make a
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
difference, and that the, Secretary of State decides to set up a body that will drive local government reorganisation a certain way, which denies people adequate salaries, underpays them, under-resources local government and leads to local government failure. That would be a very dangerous advisory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) says that if the advisory body believes that an authority proposes to fix for any employee or class of employee a rate of remuneration, it will talk to representatives of local authorities and their employees. If it is a malicious body with a particular agenda it will interfere again and again with the rates of remuneration that are offered. If it is a beneficial and positive body, why does not the Secretary of State remove the uncertainty? Why create a new body, why not use an existing body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That body could become either a source of aggravation, animosity and disillusionment in local government, or it could become a supportive organisation that smooths the way to co-operation and settles matters of remuneration in line with local authorities' ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is to be a positive and beneficial body it should not be an unknown, unspecified body—it should not be a new body that is invented for a particular purpose. In that spirit the Secretary of State should accept the amendment and possibly go further and on Report be more specific about the body. He should get rid of this uncertainty and take away the fears of local authority employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again history is made because my intervention was intervened on with a point of order. That point of order could be called the seventh cavalry because it provided time for the Minister to be given a briefing from people whom we are not allowed to mention to enable him to answer the awkward question that I had put to him. No doubt the hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) will be suitably rewarded after seven o'clock. Before I was so conveniently—for the Minister—interrupted, I said that the Government could not be referring to the previous reorganisation of local government in Scotland. Are they referring to all those expensive reorganisations of local government in England and Wales that have occurred during the lifetime of the Government in order to justify the necessity for including this provision in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now understand the hon. Gentleman's question. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that concerns were expressed about possible excessive wage and staff salary increases in relation to other reorganisations south of the border. We are proposing a reserve power that was provided in the previous reorganisation. We hope that it will not be used. A reserve power is necessary and is a safeguard for local authorities themselves against the inevitable criticism that they will use this reorgansiation to push up wage and salary costs. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is correct that I am a parliamentary consultant to the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, but for the benefit of Conservative Back Benchers who are sometimes misled on these issues, I should tell the Committee that local government officers are represented by Unison.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor did I say that it did. I was referring to the hon. Gentleman's expertise in these general matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not think that he should act like a Minister? A Minister is a dignified person. There were serious allegations that certain unnamed people received a great deal more Government money than they should have received.

Can the Minister name one case of evidence that someone received more public money than he or she should have received?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to intervene in the debate—a Chairman should not often open his mouth.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that I made no allegations against anyone. My point about the reserve powers was that members of the public might say that reorganisation might result in excessive increases for particular local authority employees.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the principal point behind the Minister's remarks? He says that he needs the advisory powers in case, during the transition period, there are—in his eyes—excessive salary and wage increases in elected local authorities. However, he does not focus the same thoughts on unelected water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that in 1973 the salary increases were caused by smaller authorities moving to larger authorities. The same applies with regional water boards moving to giant water boards. Chief executives of those boards and the inevitable host of deputy chief executives with greater responsibilities will demand higher salaries and wages to meet those responsibilities. I do not understand why the Minister wants to take powers against elected local authorities, yet does not seek similar safeguards in similar transition processes against non-elected quangos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

These are reserve powers which we hope will not need to be used. They are a safeguard for the council taxpayer, for employees and, indeed, for local authorities themselves as they will be able to say, with justification, that there cannot be any real abuse because the Secretary of State, if he so wishes, can set up an advisory body under the provisions of clause 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I sincerely hope that it will not be necessary to use the reserve powers. However, they are a necessary safeguard and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of the reserve power. We do not take issue with that power. We take issue with other factors which the Minister has, in a way, already conceded. Why is a new body necessary when there are existing organisations? Why does he not accept that the process should be carried out in parallel with the local authority associations? If the Minister were willing to accept our reasonable arguments about dialogue and then decision, and about use of an existing and not a new body, we would not need to press the amendment. Will he simply say yes or no to those two commonsense suggestions, to ease the reserve power into the statute book?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will say yes to one, but no to the other. We may need to consider a new body in this context. I can give the hon. Gentleman the absolute assurance that an advisory body, whether new or existing, could be established only after the Secretary of State has consulted such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be appropriate. I can also assure him that clearly and without equivocation the local authority body that immediately comes to mind in that context is COSLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been accused of repetition but this bears repeating. This is massive discrimination against local authorities. According to the Minister a citizen can complain against a duly elected local authority and use the mechanism of this advisory committee about which we have heard nothing in detail to fight against it. Yet citizens cannot do the same against a quango. That is in the hands of the Secretary of State. That is absolute discrimination against a publicly elected body. There should be similar powers against non-elected quangos. That point bears repetition. It is a major flaw in this Bill and it shows that the Government are on the attack against Scotland's democratically elected local councils. It is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

mistaken he is saying that every rise that is not blocked by the establishment of this board and a contrary ruling by it is accepted by the Government. That is an interesting development which causes me some anxiety. Essentially that is centralised state negotiation. Every rise that is not blocked is approved by the Government. That throws an enormous spanner into the Government's proposals for decentralisation. The clause specifically refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to any recommended levels of remuneration formulated on a national basis".</p></blockquote>
That takes inadequate account of any local negotiations that may take place because of changes, new formulations, different ways of working and different routines. There is no provision for making comparisons with any local negotiations elsewhere. The Bill refers only to nationally negotiated rates. That is a complete contradiction of the thrust which I support for decentralisation. It leaves the Government in the unfortunate position that anything that is not blocked is approved. That will come back to haunt them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to the second of the major issues to be tackled today. We have already looked at staff transfers. The decision taken by the Committee on that will make the staff commission's task much more difficult because we have created a free for all for employees. As the staff commission is to be appointed to bring some common sense and sanity to bear, that is to be regretted. Things could have been very different. Although the notes on clauses prepared by the Scottish Office refer to discussions between the Government, COSLA and the Scottish Trades Union Congress, they do not mention that despite representations to the Government, the submissions from COSLA and the STUC were largely ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments aim to put in the Bill issues that were raised in November last year, but which were unfortunately discounted by the Government. Had the Government listened then we might not have needed such a debate this evening on the staff commission. The group of amendments link in which some of the issues that have been raised previously, which are worth repeating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the issues need to be in the Bill. Far too often the Secretary of State takes more and more powers to himself, just as he does here. There is the question of trust and confidence in that process. We have little faith in it and we will not grant the Secretary of State more and more powers to shape and influence the path of this crazy reorganisation without a fight. Primary legislation is a major focal point for this group of amendments and others on clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the independence of the commission. We have already heard talk of an independent commission, but it must be truly independent. It must not be tied to the coat-tails of the Secretary of State, so that every time it looks at an issue, makes a decision or wants to consult that must be based on the diktat of central Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland. Clearly, there would be nothing independent
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
about such a commission. Of course, any Government must have a say and an influence. However, we are facing creeping centralisation and the creeping view that Big Brother in the Scottish Office knows everything even though, sometimes, he knows nothing about what is happening in local government. We must ensure that the commission is truly independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want to limit the Secretary of State's powers. We have made that point in arguments on primary legislation and when we argued for the independence of the statutory commission. However, the Secretary of State's powers must first be identified and then severely curtailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments also deal with the membership and nature of the commission and how it will carry out its works in a complex area. No one should be under any illusions. If these crazy reforms are accepted by the House, the staff commission will have an extraordinarily difficult task at a time when morale will be low, when services will be undermined and when professional organisations that are equipped to deal with the public and to provide excellent services will feel under threat from a Government who do not care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that the members of the commission have empathy with the public services and sympathy for the 300,000 employees who may be involved in the deliberations. If the Committee had not taken the fundamentally stupid decision about the transfer of all employees, it would have been much easier for the Committee's members—both male and female—to deal with the issues before us. The staff commission will require people with superhuman powers to deal with its day-to-day problems and to cope with the bungling incompetence of the Government's handling of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bottom line of the debate is the relationship between the Scottish Office and COSLA and between COSLA and the staff commission. We know from comments about COSLA's assessments of costs and from glib comments about jobs for the boys that Conservative members do not hold that organisation in esteem. That is a disgrace. However, the Committee must establish the ground rules by which dialogue can continue. Although the Government say that they listen, we rarely see any practical consequences of that. The Government must genuinely consult. Over the past 14 or 15 years the Government have been irresponsible. However the fabric of Scottish local government will depend on the decisions taken in the staff commission and on those involving the Government, STUC and COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to the meetings and consultations that were held last year. Why will the Government not listen? Surely there must be some issues in which common sense overrides the silly, petty, political and vindictive manner in which Scottish Office Ministers operate. The Committee should not be left to pick up the pieces because the Government will not accept the common-sense proposals that have been put to them about staff matters. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Those proposals are self-evident to everyone except the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), who is either getting excited by his letter writing or is treating the issue with the contempt that we normally expect from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments embrace the real issues involved. We have specified that the staff commission must be truly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
independent. The independence is linked to the factors to which I have referred, but we need to hear the Minister say that the staff commission will not be gerrymandered and that it will make a genuine attempt to tackle the issues that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would overcome the real problems posed by phrases such as, "as the Secretary of State thinks fit", or "as he considers appropriate". The Government run their business by order. Opposition Members are sick and tired of the process by which they escape criticism and debate. The Government creep around the House and allow the Secretary of State to avoid discussing details in Committee by the use of orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to clause 12 are vital. We hope that our arguments in the debate will hit home. For the sake of the 300,000 employees involved, we hope that the Government will approach the problem in a common-sense manner. They should accept the points that have been made. They should seek to make progress with the staff commission. If the Secretary of State decides to set up a pre staff commission advisory committee, much of the thinking that applies to the staff commission should apply to that committee as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In asking my questions, I seek clarification of how the Minister views the staff commission. Is it to be a body made of people with knowledge and expertise in local government who will assist both old and new authorities in the difficult task of transition?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, nor to criticise Opposition Members, but the Room's acoustics are imperfect and I am having trouble hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the staff commission to be a body full of people with little understanding or sympathy for local government? Will it be subject to control and direction by the Secretary of State? The only credible response is one that guarantees the independence of the staff commission and satisfies the need to have representatives of employer
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
and employee interests in its membership, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recognise the critical role of the staff commission in safeguarding the interests of staff subject to the reorganisation process. Will he explain why the functions of the staff commission are not defined positively in the Bill, as they were in the 1973 Act that dealt with the previous reorganisation of Scottish local government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that the credibility of the staff commission depends in part on its recognition by all parties as an independent body? Does the Minister agree that the staff commission should not be subject to direction by the Secretary of State in order to avoid its independent status being compromised? Does he agree that the credibility of the staff commission is also influenced by its composition and membership? Does he accept that the rules governing membership are specified in primary legislation and should include nominees of the relevant local government employer and employee association?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I suddenly remembered that Mr. Peggie had made an interesting speech to the COSLA conference at Dunblane, the home town of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton. I got hold of a copy of the speech, in which Mr. Peggie asked how, 20 years from now, a person of similar standing would reflect on the current reform exercise. Mr. Peggie emphasised the consensus for change and the support for new initiatives that existed at the time of the previous reorgansiation. He emphasised the huge amount of work and time that went into planning the new system on a wide basis. He noted the loss of expertise and experience caused by the 1974 reforms, and spoke of the time required to prepare for change. He questioned, implicitly, whether the Wheatley and Paterson reports got it so wrong that another reform is needed now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
