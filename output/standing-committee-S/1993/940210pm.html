	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 69, in page 115, line 29, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in Strathclyde electoral division 8 (Vale of Leven), polling district DB77 and that part of Polling District DB78 commencing at grid reference NS 3502 8396 on the southeastern boundary of that polling district then running due eastward to the track at Auchendennan Cottages; then running eastward along the said track to the A82 road; then southeastward along that road to its junction with the access to Lomond Castle Hotel; then due eastward from that junction to the eastern boundary of the Dunbarton district ward of Tullichewan/Luss in Loch Lomond; then running northwestward along that district ward boundary to the southeastern boundary of the said polling district DB77; then southwestward along that polling district boundary to the said grid reference NS 3502 8396.".</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) to resume his speech, I shall deal with the point of order raised this morning by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). The hon. Gentleman made two points, first, that the long title of the Bill is defective and secondly, that the Bill as drafted does not appear to amend the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. These are not matters of order for the Chair. As Chairman, I regulate the proceedings of the Committee. The content of the Bill, which was given a Second Reading by the House and committed to Standing Committee, is a matter for debate by the Committee. The consequential effects of a Bill need not be reflected in the long title, only the contents of the Bill. If the hon. Member feels that a matter consequential to the Bill should appear in the Bill, however, he can table an amendment to the long title.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am grateful for that information and for your ruling, which I shall study with care. I appreciate the advice that I can table an amendment that would alter
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
the long title, although it would break with precedent if the long title were extended by including the Government's motives for gerrymandering parliamentary constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I mentioned this morning the terms that would be used in Committee. I should be grateful if hon. Gentlemen would refrain from using the term "gerrymandering". There is no gerrymandering in this Committee: I do not want the term to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Martin. You are the Chairman and your rulings have the force of law in this Committee. I hope, however, that that ruling can be reviewed because the term is commonly used. It derives from an American slang expression, which has only recently become pejorative. We cannot easily discuss the Bill without using that word because the Bill enshrines that principle. If that is your ruling, Mr. Martin, so be it. Perhaps over the weekend, when you have time to deliberate and to consult a few dictionaries, you might care to reconsider the way in which you may have been forced, on the spur of the moment, to come to that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of my consulting a few dictionaries: I can think of better ways to spend my weekend. When hon. Members use such terms it gives rise to the suggestion that they are accusing other hon. Members of being unparliamentary, which they would not want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for an hon. Member, regardless of his station within his party, to make observations and comments that reflect directly on the conduct of the Committee earlier today? In fact, the Committee made changes recommended by hon. Members that show clearly that your ruling was correct, Mr. Martin. It is wrong for an hon. Member to come to the Committee and use such a term when the Committee, under your careful guidance, Mr. Martin, has carried out its duties properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Members of the Committee accept that my rulings are always correct, as they must be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. While respecting your judgment, I took it to mean that you thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) surmised that there may be a parliamentary purpose in the Government's understanding of the word, the use of which you have now said is inappropriate. In the context of local government, the proposals mean that sections will be carved out in which one party has a clear majority and no other party has influence. The word "gerrymandering" would be appropriate in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me deal with the original point of order. I will not allow the word to be used if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
there is any implication that Members of Parliament are involved in wrongdoing. Does that help the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. We need your clarification of the matter. I understand the problem, but I used the word "gerrymander", in all its pejorative sense, in the Chamber on Second Reading. Madam Speaker at no point saw fit to call me to order during my speech, in which I used the word far too often for Conservative Members. I accept your ruling if it is related to individual Members of Parliament, but not in connection with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. We can be rude about the Government, but not about individual hon. Members. My comments were made on the understanding that accusations were made against individual hon. Members in a previous sitting of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I am the last person to question your ruling, given that I was born and raised in your constituency, but I refer you to the reference in schedule 1, page 116, to East Renfrewshire. I accept your ruling that I may not accuse the Minister of gerrymandering the boundary lines for East Renfrewshire, but would it be in order to accuse of gerrymandering the person who instructed the parliamentary draftsmen to draw up those boundaries, whoever that person might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous point of order covered that question. We can talk about a political party being involved in something, but not individuals. That should give the hon. Gentleman some leeway. I am sure that he will use his good Springburn education to some effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am relatively new to Committee work, I ask for guidance about the meaning of the word "filibuster". Is what has just taken place a filibuster?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. Hon. Members do not get involved in such activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by saying through the Chair that, as always, I totally accept the Chair's rulings, both in instruction and in words of guidance. I only wish that Opposition Members would pay a little bit more regard to the words of the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make an appeal to you, Mr. Martin, about the use of the word "gerrymandering". I feel that, if the word "gerrymandering" were to be taken out of use in the Committee, the opportunity for Conservative Members to make many positive points after the Opposition have used that word would be lost. In many instancs, we are able to destroy the arguments of Opposition Members, as happened this morning with the contribution from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), when we demonstrated that gerrymandering was certainly not a feature. Conservative Members have no fears whatsoever when Opposition Members use that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could always substitute "pochled" for "gerrymandering".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his valuable contribution. There is nothing wrong with the word "pochled". It is a good, descriptive Scottish word. We should be proud of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quickly recap on some of the things that I said this morning. On the issue of Helensburgh, I believe that I presented a case that is beyond doubt. It shows that Helensburgh's position in Argyll and Bute is correct. It is in line with the wishes of the people in that area. It is accepted by those in Argyll and Bute and is welcomed enthusiastically by its elected representatives. That, above all, should register well with members of the Committee. I should like to think that Opposition Members would have the grace to withdraw the amendment, which cuts across the wishes of the people of Helensburgh in Argyll and Bute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have demonstrated that Luss' contacts, communications and interests lie with Helensburgh. On that basis, it seems that the only way ahead is for my hon. Friend the Minister to accept the amendment that I tabled and thus bring a degree of joy not to 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 people, who would be influenced by that decision, but to some 340 people who live in the Luss and Arden area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak, especially after the hon. Member for Ayr. Earlier, I asked the hon. Gentleman whether he had consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), in whose constituency Luss is situated. The hon. Member for Ayr said that he had raised the matter with my hon. Friend. I spoke to my hon. Friend and he claimed that that was not the case. As soon as my hon. Freind the Member for Dumbarton discovered that the hon. Member for Ayr had tabled the amendment and had spoken to people in Dumbarton constituency, he approached the hon. Member for Ayr. My hon. Friend was worried that the hon. Member for Ayr had seriously contravened the convention of the House. No courtesy has been extended to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Earlier, you said that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) should withdraw his remarks about my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), yet the hon. Gentleman is again attacking my hon. Friend. Can you bring him to heel and ask him to stop casting slurs on my hon. Friend's integrity and his ability to represent his constituents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should be some continuity in the Committee; we should get on with our business. I always allow some lead in to an amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will now speak about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton asked me to speak about the amendment on his behalf because he is not a member of the Committee. If the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) wants to get on the Chairmen's Panel, he can apply to the Speaker. I am sure that he would not be able to do the job as well as you, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried because the hon. Member for Ayr has not only broken the convention with regard to my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
the Member for Dumbarton, but also in relation to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the point has been raised, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West has gone to see the Speaker because the hon. Member for Ayr is dealing with her constituency but has not informed her officially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have given notification to the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West. A note was put on the board this afternoon. I might add that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West approached me and asked me to speak to members from Dunfermline district council, with a view to tabling an amendment along the lines which I have tabled. That is my understanding and that was why I met with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are well into Committee proceedings. Hon. Members will agree that my co-Chairman and I have allowed a certain leeway regarding amendments and debate, but the discussions that have been taking place show how, when hon. Members digress from the amendment, the Committee becomes taken up wih all sorts of matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not debating Dunfermline. We are debating amendments relating to the Helensburgh area and Dumbartonshire. I hope that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will speak to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I distinctly heard the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) refer to my hon. Friend as a liar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear that. Did the hon. Gentleman make that comment? [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes, he did."] Order. I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman if hon. Members are shouting in the background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are checking the facts and I withdraw the comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remark has been withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the points that I did because my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton wants the case in relation to Luss put quite differently from the way it was put by the hon. Member for Ayr, whom he believes to be misrepresenting matters. He asked me to point out that Luss community council held no public meeting. No members of the public were able to attend to make comments. A copy of today's 	<i>Lennox Herald</i> has been faxed to me. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Angry Luss residents this week claimed that they have not been consulted on the moves to join Argyll and Bute.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>They say that there has been no poll in the village and letters were circulated by the community council telling them to write to the Secretary of State asking for Luss to be torn from Dumbarton."</p></blockquote>
The report states, further on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Already the matter is in the hands of Ayrshire MP Phil Gallie, who has put the amendment in the hands of the Government's select committee on local government reform."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
It continues>:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But Luss pensioners Mrs. Jean McKimmie and Mrs. Janet Clow claim that the community council 'has gone behind our backs.' "</p></blockquote>
Mrs. McKimmie and Mrs. Clow said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'No one explained what we should do if we wanted to stay in Dumbarton District and I know of only six people that sent these letters off.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Local MP John McFall, who was approached by Mrs. McKimmie and Mrs. Clow at a recent surgery was outraged at the way they had been treated.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The pensioners told the MP that they heavily relied on Alexandria for doctors and shopping and that they had no links with Helensburgh at all"—</p></blockquote>
contrary to what the hon. Member for Ayr led us to believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand also that there is regular bus service used by pensioners from Luss to Alexandria, but no bus from Luss—no bus for us from Luss—and no transport from Luss to Helensburgh. There is also a problem relating to school catchment areas—a subject that arises regularly in discussion of boundaries. Children from Luss go to school in Alexandria because the catchment area feeds in that direction. It is only if they opt out that they go to school in Helensburgh. The links that exist are clearly with Alexandria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case a campaign seems to have been mounted by the local community council. I understand from local people that there is a suspicion that the Luss estates may have been involved in having the campaign mounted. Presumably it is thought that by moving their huge estates into Argyll they enjoy the prospect of paying substantially less in rates. I believe that a Conservative councillor—a Mr. Norman Glenn—approached the hon. Member for Ayr and asked him to table the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not mention the word "gerrymander" but, presumably, the estates have their eyes on a boundary redistribution that would make Argyll a possible target seat for the Conservatives to take from the Liberal Democrats, so there is a political motivation behind it. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will be interested to hear that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the area well, but I have been given precise information by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton, who represents it extremely competently. He is worried that the hon. Member for Ayr has misrepresented the position, and is eager that that be put right. I am glad to have had the opportunity to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before putting a precise question, may I commend to the Minister for his bedside reading the autobiography of the Conservative Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law? He described his early life. He lived in Helensburgh. There were three trains: one departed for Glasgow Central at 7.4 am, the next at 8.4 am and the third at 9.4 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his earliest life, Bonar Law took the 7.4 train, known as the train for the strivers. He was promoted in his Glasgow office, and the 8.4 am train was the train of the drivers. When he finally made it, before becoming a Member of Parliament, he took the 9.4 am train from Helensburgh, the train for the thrivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern of commuting has changed but little. Helensburgh is a prosperous outpost of Glasgow. I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, made further inquiries to ascertain the facts.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
Helensburgh is, as it was in Bonar Law's day, a dormitory town for Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises an important question of principle: should people who earn their corn in a big conurbation try when it suits them in their place of residence, to alter the boundaries of that place of residence simply to be advantaged in respect of rates? I am not saying that all Helensburgh's citizens are motivated by lower rates, but they do have an influence. What is the morality of people who earn their bread and butter in one area which, rightly or wrongly, has rather high rates, opting to take advantage of going into a lower-rated area that does not provide their livelihood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) about the strivers, drivers and thrivers, may I point out that Strathclyde region has now provided a 10.4 am train—for the skivers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), spoke about education provision. I should like further clarification of his extremely helpful comments which I look forward to reading in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> I want to pursue the point about what will happen to each school under both the Helensburgh proposals and the additional proposals covering Luss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, because there is no Catholic secondary school in Argyll and Bute, the pupils from St. Joseph's would, under the present system, be guaranteed the right of transfer to Our Lady and St. Patrick's high school in Dumbarton, where places would be guaranteed; and the money for this would be transferred from authority to authority under an inter-authority payments scheme and free travel would continue to be guaranteed. Under the present system the pupils in the primary school would be guaranteed a place in the secondary school, and their siblings, even though they are not at school at this time, would have the right to move from the primary to the secondary school in Dumbarton in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens, however, to those pupils who are not siblings and who are not at school? I wish to clarify whether, in such circumstances, when there is no Catholic secondary school in Argyll and Bute, the existing law will prevail. The existing law states that these pupils would not be obliged to attend a non-denominational school in Argyll but would retain the right to go to the Catholic secondary school in Dumbarton and have their fares paid. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify that point. It is only by explaining what would happen in particular circumstances that generalised anxieties will be dissipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have concerns about another school, which raises issues of principle that will be discussed, no doubt in the abstract, when we come to clauses 32 and 33. Luss primary, as a result of a previous amalgamation, has an arrangement whereby pupils may transfer for their secondary education, either to Vale or Leven, in Dumbarton—a division of Strathclyde as is—or to Hermitage academy in Argyll. Under either arrangement, pupils will go to different authorities for their secondary education. Unless the local authorities involved take a decision, under the present arrangements, to reallocate boundaries, the existing pattern would remain: those
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
youngsters who are entitled to free travel would continue to exercise that right, and the status quo would continue until such time as the authorities determined that it should be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue will arise should one authority unilaterally decide that it wants to change the arrangements, but that should perhaps be discussed more in the abstract at a later stage. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee if I respond briefly to the hon.Gentleman's points. He has been chairman of the education committee of Strathclyde and has been familiar with the problems for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether pupils from the Helensburgh area who currently attend the Roman Catholic primary school will continue to attend Our Lady and St. Patrick's Roman Catholic high school in Dumbarton after reorganisation, when the latter will lie in a different education authority. I confirm to him that, under the existing legislation, pupils already attending Our Lady and St. Patrick's Roman Catholic high school at the time of reorganisation, will remain there until they have completed their schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether catchment areas and feedeer primary arrangements are to be amended in future, that will be for the new education authorities to determine. I am not aware of any reason why such a change need occur in this or in any other case. That would be a matter for local consideration. It is certainly not for the Scottish Office to dictate what authorities should or should not be proposing to meet local needs and priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new Dumbarton and Clydebank authority at some point decided to propose changes affecting Our Lady and St. Patrick's statute, it would first have to consult locally. If it then decided to pursue such proposals, because Our Lady and St. Patrick's was more than 80 per cent. full, those proposals would have to be referred to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland for a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, under the existing legislation, the Roman Catholic Church would, in such circumstances, be fully entitled to make representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland about educational provision for the pupils involved. Pupils from the Roman Catholic primary school in Helensburgh will continue to attend Our Lady and St. Patrick's after reorganisation, so long as the present primary feeder arrangements apply. The transport costs to Dumbarton would continue to be paid. This legislation does not change the existing statutory provision establishing the right to Roman Catholic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan touched on transport. The provision of transport is a matter for education authorities and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what may happen in the future in individual cases. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that existing statutory provisions on transport to schools will apply after reorganisation. Those provisions are extensive and flexible. As for the choice of schools, the placing of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
requests legislation applies to all schools irrespective of education authority boundaries. We want maximum continuity and I shall consider with particular care the points that have been made before we reach clause 32, when we will go into these issues much more deeply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister concludes, could he clarify this matter, because he has moved away from what he said earlier? The redistricting of Dumbarton was discussed, but the difficulty is with the redistricting of Argyll. There is a Catholic primary, but no Catholic secondary in Argyll. The issue that has caused anxiety—and will cause more anxiety after what you have said—is whether—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, the hon. Gentleman should refer to what the Minister had to say and not the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, quite. The issue that has caused anxiety is whether those Catholic parents would retain the right for their children to go to Catholic secondary school. I understand the point that the Minister made about placing requests, but the difficulty with that is that the school might be 80 per cent. full now, but it could become 100 per cent. full and there would then be no places available for Catholic children from another division. It might be filled due to placing requests from Dumbarton division even if those children were not counted as being in its catchment area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of placing requests does not cover the problem of who pays for bussing. Middle class, well-off Catholics might be able to afford Catholic education and its travel costs, but working class or poor Catholics might not. I am sure that the Government do not want that; we certainly do not. There should be a free choice irrespective of financial background. If the Minister cannot clarify this matter today, I hope that he will be able to do so in a future debate or in response to my letter, which is winging its way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put down a marker for clause 32 on the subject of transport costs? The Minister is like the biblical Levite passing by on the other side of the road. The problem is the money available to local authorities. The Helensburgh case could be repeated right round Scotland; it is not a one-off case, it is an almost typical situation. Is there to be special transport devoted to Catholic children, because that would not provide the same match of buses to needs as we have now? Transport for Catholic children will become that much more expensive for the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be reasonable about this matter, Mr. Martin. Can we discuss it on clause 32 and can the Scottish Office provide us with statistics to back up its argument? I think that the statistics will show that what the Minister has told us is neither viable nor realistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret having to take part in the debate again, but I feel obliged to, given the opening remarks of the hon.

I cannot recall whether I said that I had contacted him or that he had contacted me: we shall see from 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow. My recollection is that the hon.

In this place we should be debating at a much more serious level and in an adult fashion, and we should not be caught up in trivia. Those remarks and the inferences made were trivial and I regret them very much. I hope that, as we get on to other important areas, trivia will be put aside and we will have an honest and earnest debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Member for Ayr referred to "honest and earnest debate", which implies that there has been some dishonesty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are getting rather picky. Those terms should not be taken out of context.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise you, Mr. Martin, that I shall stick to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge the fact that two elderly people in the village of Luss complained to their local Member of Parliament. It was suggested that the community council had not acted responsibly. My information, which tallies with what the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, is that circulars were passed round, people were given the facts and asked to make comments. Some did and some did not, and I respect the views of those two elderly people, who would have preferred the Dumbarton link. In any democratic process, there will be those for and those against. The vast majority are in favour of Luss being joined with Helensburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My initial contact was councillor Norman Glenn, but my contacts since then have not, to my knowledge, been party members. One was councillor Petrie and another was Rev. Nicoll, who is the vicar of Luss and Arrochar parish church. I had no contact with those people prior to my involvement in the Luss issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Govan referred to the movement of children for secondary education, he suggested the option of the Vale of Leven or Hermitage school within Helensburgh. I understand that the vast majority of children opt for the Hermitage school. That is further evidence that Luss's natural link is with Helensburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to what my hon. Friend the Minister said about the requirements for Catholic secondary education. I believe that everyone should have a right to Catholic secondary education. I have every confidence that existing legislation will be carried over into this Bill to safeguard the right to Catholic secondary education in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
Government should tell us the size of the transportation problem and the costs involved. The Minister said earlier that there shall be no new money. Such extra costs will directly affect the services of the new authority. Can we have an assurance that we will be given detailed information on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will leave that to my hon. Friend the Minister. No doubt he will respond when the appropriate clause is before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief because I respect the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan. He has shown his expertise as a previous convenor of education in Strathclyde. He has done much to advance the thinking of the Scottish Office about this ill-thought-out Bill and its effects on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that has been brought to my notice is that Strathclyde operates a better system of payment for buses for children than that in the legislation. Up to the age of eight, the range is normally three miles, and over the age of eight, it is normally two miles. In Strathclyde, the ranges are two miles and one mile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Bill will cost a great deal, we do not believe that it will make any finance available to small authorities such as Argyll to provide transport facilities for the people of Helensburgh. That is why I support amendments Nos. 21 and 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a few issues relating to the provision of special education, a service in which I spent 15 years. It has always been something of a Cinderella subject, but I compliment Strathclyde for trying to offer quality provision. Children from Helensburgh have to travel to different parts of Strathclyde depending on their specific needs. People are worried about what guarantees will be given to maintain those provisions in future. It is clear that no one knows where those children will go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Argyll does not provide a programme such as that at Middlefield school for communication disorders including autism. Would the new authority have the finances to provide such a facility? Would it be allowed to buy into facilities in other areas and would the children be happy with that? Facilities such as those at the Carnbooth school for children with dual sensory impairment can only be provided by large authorities. Strathclyde has done that very well. Such schools in Strathclyde are not scattered about—they are concentrated and many are in the Glasgow area. That is for the reasons of commuting that were discerned by the Wheatley commission. That is why the estuarial principle was used in previous local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried because the Bill contains no safeguards. It has been admitted that Argyll sees Helensburgh as a source of cash, and there will be a tremendous outflow of money. For example, £68,000 is the cost of bussing children to Catholic schools. However, money will have to be provided not only for those children going to Catholic schools, but to those who wish to cross boundaries. Will small authorities be able to provide that money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will small authorities be able to provide the special education facilities that children require? I think not. That is why it makes sense to connect Helensburgh to
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
Dumbarton. The signs are that the Government are not sympathetic to that view, but that is probably because they have not thought the issue through. In the vox pop surveys carried out, people are not asked whether they would cause problems for a family with a child with special needs if that were to their advantage. Thank goodness, most people in Scotland show compassion and would place their own less critical needs behind those of parents of that child. However, that is not how the surveys are carried out. They are always based on consideration of an argument of whether something is "good for you" and how in a new authority people would have to spend less money. Yet, the downside for children with special needs is not made clear. In Helensburgh, it is clear that there will be a downside. The Government have not thought through those problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by considering the invitation of the hon. Member for Linlithgow that I should read Bonar Law's autobiography. I am currently reading the biography of David Lloyd George, which will please the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. I shall endeavour to read Bonar Law's autobiography after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time that I praised the speech of the hon. Member for Govan, he immediately leapt to his feet and accused me of wasting the Committee's time. Let me just say that his speech was well researched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Labour party has chosen to table only a limited number of boundary amendments—I make no complaints about that—I am surprised at this choice of amendment. It leads to a most interesting conclusion, because the Labour party has argued consistently that smaller authorities will have great difficulties and will be unable to supply services efficiently. Labour Members have argued that in speech after speech, but they are proposing to make the new Argyll authority considerably smaller, at 65,000, than the Government's proposal. I am glad to have Labour's confirmation that it regards authorities of 65,000 people as perfectly viable in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also surprised at the amendment because, while many of the Government's proposals for different parts of Scotland are undoubtedly controversial, I do not believe that this one is. Indeed, I thought that the provisions would spread sweetness and light. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr rightly spotted the Government's secret motivation in merging Helensburgh with Argyll. As he said, Dumbarton district council has long wished to be a nuclear-free zone. The Labour party in Dumbarton will now have that privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Liberal point of view, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) confirmed that his hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) supports the district council's position that bringing Helensburgh into Argyll will provide a well-resourced and balanced authority. Argyll is an independent council headed by a provost who I understand is a member of the Labour party, and there is firm support for the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of his excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr referred to public opinion in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
Helensburgh. He is correct that public opinion on such issues is seldom unanimous. We all know and accept that. He was right to point, however, to the surveys conducted by the 	<i>Helensburgh Advertiser</i> that showed that 95 per cent. of those polled were in favour of Helensburgh being separated from Dumbarton. He was also right to point out the unanimous view of the local councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the White Paper was published, we have received a significant number of letters from people in Helensburgh and Cardross, almost all of whom have supported the merger with Argyll and Bute. That is relatively unusual. It is more usual for members of the public to write to the Government if they disagree with what is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister any means of knowing how many of those who have written to him earn their bread and butter in Argyll and Bute, and how many earn their bread and butter in the Greater Glasgow conurbation? I stick to my point that there is a moral issue when people earn their money in one area and are in a sense committed to it. That is especially relevant considering that we have been told—accurately, I am sure—that Helensburgh has not been associated with Argyll and Bute since mediaeval times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that I do not know. People simply wrote from their home addresses expressing their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not seriously suggesting that the logic of his argument should be followed through—that is, that a Greater Glasgow should extend through Clydebank and Dumbarton to Helensburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And beyond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And, indeed, beyond, the Hon. Member for Govan may prefer a Greater Glasgow that spreads down through Ayrshire and sweeps over Eastwood, as was pointed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister bear in mind that earlier in the debate I believe that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I raise a serious matter. In an earlier exchange in Committee, the hon. Member for Ayr said that my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West had asked him to put forward an amendment. He also said that he had sent a letter to my hon. Friend this afternoon. I have just spoken to my hon. Friend and I can confirm that she has received no letter from the hon. Member for Ayr. She has also confirmed that she did not ask for an amendment to be

I cannot think that it is right for members of the Committee to cast aspersions on the character of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West in relation to a council that is in her constituency. My hon. Friend has been doing excellent work and feels extremely let down by the actions of the hon.

If it is, surely it is perfectly in order for the matter to be dealt with in such a way, accepting that there are conventions in the House. Provided that the conventions are followed, they cannot be raised as points of order by those who want to make mischief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the points of order were raised, I was referring to a point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. Grant distribution is population adjusted to take account of tourists and commuters. Glasgow receives more money to reflect the large number of people who travel to work there daily. The museum and galleries grant also reflects that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr was correct to emphasise the support for Helensburgh district joining Argyll—or being separate from Dumbarton—that was given by the area's community councils. I accept the general point made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that what a community council states might not necessarily reflect the views of everybody in an area. That is reasonable, but Cove and Kilcreggan community council initially was unanimously in favour of a Helensburgh district council—hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree that that would be too small—with a second option of Helensburgh joining Argyll and Bute. Arrochar held a referendum that produced a large majority in favour of the area joining Argyll and Bute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Argyll and Bute district council has consistently stated that it would be happy to incorporate Helensburgh in a new unitary authority. There are a number of similarities between Argyll and Bute and Helensburgh to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr referred. Both areas are heavily involved in tourism and the holiday trade. Light industry and commercial facilities are similar and both areas have military facilities. The problems of requirements and changing needs are similar in the scattered communities of both areas. A well-balanced authority will be created.

The hon. Member for Govan asked about transport. I refer him to clause 40(3), which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order—designate the passenger transport area of the Authority".</p></blockquote>
I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking that the Secretary of State will consult fully before exercising the power; indeed, he intends to start that process with all interested bodies as soon as possible.

My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr tabled amendments Nos. 69 and 70, which are more limited. Members of the Committee would agree that my hon. Friend has every right to table the amendments, as we all have the right to table amendments that reflect our interest in any part of Scotland or result from representations made by outside bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that if outside bodies make representations to a member of the Committee, it is perfectly in order for amendments to be tabled. However, if those outside organisations are professional lobbyists who offer payment, I hope that the Minister would agree that the honourable course would be for hon. Members to decline that payment and decline to table amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree. I do not think that any member of the Committee has done anything other than act entirely honourably. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that he did not think the Luss community council necessarily reflected the opinions of everyone in Luss, but I am sure that he does not accuse them of hiring Westminster lobbyists to lobby the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would agree that this is annoying for hon. Members. The hon. Member for Ayr seems to have made it his business to go around Scotland seeking out views that appear to oppose other hon. Members and then to table amendments, some of which I am led to believe have been drafted by a professional lobbying organisation. I hope that the Minister would agree that that is not how we should conduct our affairs. We are not here to be pushed and lobbied and pressed by a professional lobbying organisation which seems to be using a particular hon. Member to go around Scotland, stirring it up, getting the information and tabling the amendments. That is not a natural way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting back to personal remarks and attacks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I think that it would be in good order to accept that hon. Members are tabling amendments because they feel that it is appropriate for the Committee to consider them. I hope that we do not get back to personal attacks because they delay the business of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, if I am not interrupted again, to finish in the next minute or so. Our original proposal for Luss and Arden was influenced by historical factors linking the area to the Vale of Leven and the then expressed views of the community council which we had every reason to believe were broadly representative of the area. Since the publication of the White Paper, we have received in writing the views of the community council of Luss and Arden. Its decision was unanimous. Each member of the community council was asked to consult with people in his or her area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also received letters from Luss and Arden from people who, to my knowledge, are not members of the Conservative party. They have all argued that the natural links between Luss and Arden and Helensburgh are by far the most predominant consideration that the Committee should take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must issue the usual caveat to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr that we would like to check his amendments Nos. 69 and 70 technically to see whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
any subsequent amendments would need to be drafted. With that caveat, we think that the amendments are perfectly sensible and reflect local opinion and I am happy to accept them. But I must ask the Committee to reject the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Govan and his colleagues if they are pressed to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great pleasure in moving the amendment. Before I begin, in case there is any nit-picking, let me declare two interests. First, I have a link with Scottish Power, of which more or less everyone in Ayrshire is a customer. I give a firm assurance, however, that that will not affect my comments or my judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as Ayrshire's only Tory Member of Parliament, I want to fight for and obtain the best measures for not just my constituents, but all people in Ayrshire. On that basis, I register an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been easy for me simply to have accepted the Government's proposals for south Ayrshire as they stand. From day one of the consultation process people in Kyle and Carrick argued strongly for an all-purpose unitary authority. A population of 113,400 would create an authority of rational size and ensure that the principal objectives of the Bill to work in the best interests of local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
people and to make councillors accountable would be met. Kyle and Carrick produced a report that demonstrated the financial benefits that would arise from the creation of a unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improvements in services such as education could be made. Under Strathclyde's management, Castlehill school in my constituency was scheduled for replacement. That decision changed virtually overnight from provision to closure. If the new authority of South Ayrshire could not manage education issues better than did Strathclyde regional council in that instance, it would be a poor do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I will not have to intervene often—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will make a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Minister. The record should be put right. The hon. Gentleman is attacking Strathclyde, but it implemented a full consultation process in relation to Castlehill primary school. I opposed the school's closure, which I made clear to Strathclyde during the consultation period. Ultimately, because of spaces in Forehill and Kincaidston primary schools, Strathclyde decided against what the hon. Gentleman and I recommended. The hon. Gentleman cannot say that that was an overnight decision. It was made after consultation with all the people involved and because the Government are pressurising Strathclyde to save money by making full again schools that were half empty. Therefore, the pressure for that action came from the Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not mislead the Committee again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not misleading the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What I meant to imply was that I hope that the hon. Member for Ayr will not continue to give information to the Committee that is clearly not correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If accuracy was a requirement of the Committee, very few of us, including me, would be able to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley of the Castlehill issue: one day, the school board's intention, of which the pupils and parents were aware, was that Castlehill was on a replacement programme. The next day it was announced
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
that that decision was not to proceed—in effect, there was an overnight change. I do not intend to and will not mislead the Committee, although there will be differences of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For several years my constituents have been poorly treated regarding nursery education provision. With the establishment of the South Aryshire authority, such services will be given a boost and will be available in parts of my constituency where there is a real need. That will not be an easy task, but a new, accountable local authority will be able to aim at that and, I hope, to achieve that target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The papers presented by Kyle and Carrick demonstrate that there is a link between social work and housing. The establishment of a unitary authority will give great benefits. It will be wonderful to have one authority that is responsible for both a structural plan and the actual detailed planning. Perhaps, at long last, those areas will merge and work together in the interests of and to the benefit of people in specific areas, instead of working in opposition, as they do now, on the very issues that are so important to local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schools in the main catchment areas do not present a problem in establishing the new South Ayrshire authority goals. There could be a problem with the proposed North Ayrshire authority, however, if we thought that cross-border co-operation would not occur. In Dalrymple school, in the constituency of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, there is a link to the Ayr constituency and to the future South Ayrshire local authority. That has not been discussed, but I am sure that it will be in future in a co-operative manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with my hon. Friends, I received a letter from Tom Fulton—a colleague of many of us—who is now the secretary of the Dalrymple community council, in which he and his council regretted any proposal to demise Strathclyde. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that there are people in Ayrshire who recognise the amount of good that Strathclyde planning has done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without a doubt, the hon. Gentleman is correct: it would be unusual if there were no differences of opinions. The majority opinion among my constituents and those in other areas—areas that I shall discuss later—matches mine, and not that of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition mentioned the chairman of Dalrymple community council. In my original request for consultation to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I noted that there was a degree of logic in putting Doon Valley, Dalrymple, Patna and Dalmellington in with the South Ayrshire constituency, based around Kyle and Carrick. The Secretary of State did not take up the opinions that I voiced at an open meeting in Ayr, which the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley also attended. I suggested to the hon. Gentleman that the issue was important to his area, and that I might have some sympathy with any amendment that he might table in that regard. The hon. Gentleman chose not to do so. I respect his views, but I respect my constituents' desire to have a local authority based predominantly in Kyle and Carrick, which is what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coy about amendments such as this, however, I note that Tom Fulton, the respected former chairman of the Scottish Labour party, holds the same opinion. He is a serious man. His view is shared by Richard Morton, chairman of Dalrymple community council. Was that the person to whom the hon. Gentleman was referring? I do not want to make much of that—I am merely registering a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the names of the chairmen of all the community councils in Ayrshire, especially those outside my constituency. However, Mr. Fulton's opinions are to be respected, as are those of others. I shall argue my own case, and I am not at present concerned with Mr. Fulton's argument for Dalrymple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consideration of the democratic process involved in single-tier authorities leads us back to the 1992 general election. I grasped that issue firmly and spoke about it on people's doorsteps and at about 11 public meetings around my constituency. I said that my aim was to have Strathclyde dismantled and to establish a South Ayrshire authority. I am pleased to say that that objective is expressed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general election was one thing. What happened after it was remarkable. In the district elections in Kyle and Carrick, Conservative policy was to push for a single-tier authority. In Kyle and Carrick, there are 25 district council seats. Seven seats were held by the Conservative party before the election. After it, we held 15 seats, and the former Labour administration was reduced to a nine-seat rump. That change of seats represents a 33 per cent. swing to the Conservatives, which must be interpreted as meaning that the people of south Ayrshire had great faith in the objective of establishing a single-tier local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, some community councils were in favour of the proposals, some against. Tenants associations offered support but some bodies—such as the Ayrshire and Arran health board and Ayrshire Enterprise—spoke against. Opposition Members often refer to such bodies as quangos, so I wonder why they give such credence to the statements that they have made. Both organisations play a valuable role in the community, but they are not authoritative about the functions of local authorities. They have their responsibilities, but local authorities have a different set of aims, objectives and achievements. As we are discussing other bodies, I draw the Committee's attention to South Ayrshire trust, which strongly favours the proposed South Ayrshire authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. He should contact South Ayrshire trust. It has good words for not only Kyle and Carrick and the future South Ayrshire but the involvement of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. However, it does not support the push of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley for an all-Ayrshire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley may disagree, but I remember a time when he would not speak to the Ayrshire and Arran health board. He distanced himself from it and would not attend its meetings. He seems to accept the South Ayrshire trust and have some confidence in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman an opportunity to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The meetings of Ayrshire and Arran health board have nothing to do with the amendment. Comments should be confined to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I suggest that health board's opinions about that issue are also not relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee no difficulty with the proposed arrangements for south Ayrshire. The two-Ayrshire split would ensure a voice for my constituents.The proposed three-Ayrshire split would extend that right northwards. I shall consider that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline briefly the case against an all-Ayrshire authority. It would strongly favour urban interests, such as those of Kilmarnock and Cumnock. The views of south and north Ayrshire would disappear in a wilderness. An all-Ayrshire authority would lead to a lack of accountability. The authority would be large and consist of many members representing mainly areas in the central belt. Such a centralised authority would not fully appreciate local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new authorities will have powers over education and social services. Size is important for those services. A large authority has disadvantaged my constituents in the past. People will relate more easily to the proposed south Ayrshire, which will be more identifiable than an all-Ayrshire authority. That is clear to all members of the Committee, but especially to Conservative Members. Important issues such as education and social services are one matter, but district councils have given an excellent service to the people that they represent. We should not forget the services relating to leisure facilities, gardens, cemeteries, environmental health—the emptying of dustbins and street cleaning—and, most importantly, housing for local people, who need to have a say in their community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for the South Ayrshire authority is unchallengeable. The Government's proposals are profound and wise and I do not need to advance the arguments for such a soundly based case.

Amendment No. 8 relates to the case for splitting the proposed North Ayrshire authority. Many arguments in favour of South Ayrshire authority could be applied to North Ayrshire. Local identity and accountability are extremely important and the arguments advanced in respect of leisure and environmental health apply as much to Cunninghame, Kilmarnock and Loudoun as they do to Kyle and Carrick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand—I will apologise if I am misquoting—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I will apologise if I am seen to be wrong, unlike some Opposition Members. I understand that two of the hon. Members who represent Ayrshire favour an all-Ayrshire authority but I believe that three hon. Members who represent Ayrshire favour a three-way split, two of whom—I am the third—would have preferred the status quo. I respect that view. The other two hon. Members expressed a preference for a three-way split in Ayrshire rather than the proposed South Ayrshire and North Ayrshire authorities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman was talking to one of his hon. Friends when I made that statement. I acknowledge what I said: I believed that to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a councillor in Cunninghame for some four years. At that time, there was a feeling in the north of Cunninghame that the urban-based council did not serve the needs of the entire area. Since then, there has been a sea change. There is a greater identity with the council and it is remarkable that today there is all-party representation from Cunninghame arguing the case for a separate, single-tier authority to be established in that area. There is a remarkable degree of support for that proposal from the community councils. That says much about how Cunninghame has been managed, especially recently, and I compliment those responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not envisage any major problems in respect of schools in Cunninghame. If there were any problems, they are more likely to occur in my original home village of Skelmorlie where the children travel across the borders, because of the establishment of the Aryshire and Renfrewshire authorities. Pupils travel from Skelmorlie into the Greenock area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
In the late 1970s, there was a tremendous furore in Skelmorlie when it was suggested that children should be taken from Largs and pushed towards Greenock. That was not what people wanted but it happened anyway because Strathclyde imposed it. When a further change was contemplated in the late 1980s to reverse that requirement for Skelmorlie children, the Greenock argument prevailed. Somehow, the arguments had turned turtle. People do not like change, and the Committee should bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cunninghame district council expressed its views in a leaflet which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The population in each area"—</p></blockquote>
of a three-division Ayrshire—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be much more equal and similar to that of other authorities proposed by the Government".</p></blockquote>
The numbers are not too important, but in an area such as Ayrshire, it is reasonable to expect a balance, which would be of some value. The leaflet continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 3 authorities would be able to reflect more effectively the views of their own communities".</p></blockquote>
That is a significant factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ayrshire chamber of commerce has put a case in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority, and I acknowledge that it supports that ideal. The basis for its view is that it will be easier to deal with one authority rather than with three. I differ from that view because I believe that in dealings with the chamber of commerce, each area will have a voice and make its views known. The areas will co-operate with each other to the advance of Ayrshire. That will be to the mutal advantage of every area, and good for all. The benefits will not be concentrated on one area only, probably the central belt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with other members of the Committee, I received a letter dated 3 February from Richard Cole-Hamilton of the Ayrshire chamber of commerce and subsequently telephoned him about that letter. The chamber of commerce is anxious about the matter, and I quote from item 6 of the letter, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The chamber is also keen to see the Government create a plan for change which has minimal initial and ongoing costs. This is of major concern to the business community and, in any subsequent Local Government arrangement, a high level of service must be closely coupled to value for money."</p></blockquote>
What is the hon. Gentleman's response on the key question of a minimal initial and on-going costs? Some of us believe that pension enhancement and other matters mean that on-going costs will not last for five years but for 15 or more years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My feeling is that the three-way split will benefit Ayrshire. Centres of administration already exist in Cunninghame. The difficulty would perhaps lie with Kilmarnock and Loudoun, Cumnock and Doon Valley merging together; there may be additional costs in that particular area. In relation to south Ayrshire, however, the establishment already exists and costs will be minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The packages presented by Cunninghame district and Kyle and Carrick show that there will be overall cost savings in the changes proposed, certainly in the long term, for the single-tier local authorities. There will be benefits for businesses and individuals in Ayrshire from the three-way split.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that, at present, all-party groups on Cunninghame district council accept and want their own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
single-tier authority. Kilmarnock and Loudoun district council have given approval to a Kilmarnock and Loudoun, Cumnock and Doon Valley authority as proposed in the amendment. South Ayrshire is also persuaded to go for the Kyle and Carrick district, as proposed. On the political splits, I have referred to all-party groups in Cunninghame and Kilmarnock and Loudoun, albeit that the local Labour party has some reservations. I understand that it would prefer an all-Ayrshire authority, but the majority of the council gave cross-party support for the three-way split. Kyle and Carrick is, of course, Conservative controlled and perhaps some would say that that has a political connotation—there is no such connotation when we look at Cunninghame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stand aside now and ask the Committee to rest assured that the proposals have the widest possible support from the local authorities in south Ayrshire and north Ayrshire areas. I commend them to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in a debate about the future of local government in Ayrshire—a matter of great concern not only to local councillors but to the whole population. I shall be paying particular attention to the views of the population and of organisations that represent the Ayrshire people, in asking the Committe to support amendment No. 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his reception of a deputation from Cumnock and Doon Valley district council and from Kyle and Carrick Labour group. He received the deputation, which I accompanied, with his usual courtesy. I was particularly grateful to him for listening to the points that were made. I am not sure whether he will take account of them. We shall see that later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to say a word of thanks to Conservative Members, from whom I particularly single out hon. Members from English constituencies. They have been battered around a bit by some Scottish hon. Members—not of course from my party but from others. A delegation has come down on behalf of the Ayrshire Makes Sense campaign, and it asked me to say that it was received very courteously and attentively by Conservative Members, particularly those who represent English constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representatives of the Ayrshire Makes Sense campaign are acting on behalf of an all-party—a non-party—campaign. David Donaldson has a distinguished business record. Indeed, he was a Conservative candidate some time ago in Shettleston. He did not have a great chance there but he carried the Conservative flag with great dignity and since then has had a distinguished career in business. Douglas Hemmings, who served with distinction for a long time as chief executive of Cumnock and Doon Valley district council is greatly respected. Councillors Eric Ross and David Sneller, the convenor and leader of Cumnock and Doon Valley district council have been here yesterday and today, to meet Conservative Members. They represent a Committee that includes, the chairman of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley Conservative Association, who is strongly in favour of an all-Ayrshire council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ayrshire Makes Sense campaign includes representatives of the Catholic Church, appointed to the committee by Bishop Maurice Taylor, who believes that it is in that Church's interest that an all-Ayrshire single-tier
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
authority should be created. The Church of Scotland is represented on the campaign, as is the National Farmers Union and community councils from all over Ayrshire, the chairmen of industry and commerce, Enterprise Ayrshire and voluntary organisations. That is why my arguments—and not those of the hon. member for Ayr—represent the views of the organisations and people of the whole county of Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall summarise the powerful case that has been argued in the past couple of days, and previously set out in documents sent to hon. Members. In common with the Ayrshire Makes Sense campaign, my hon. Friends and I believe that to provide services such as education, social work and roads, authorities of the size of Ayrshire are necessary. Ayrshire is similar to Fife, which has a distinguished record of providing such services. Campaigners believe that such services—especially those for the mentally and physically handicapped and disabled, and for children and the elderly can best be provided efficiently and effectively by an authority of about the size of Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidently, the campaigners believe that having an authority of that size would do away with the need for joint boards which, from my experience in local government, I know to be cumbersome and unwieldy for decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to Strathclyde local government reorganisation unit, which has kindly worked out for me that if the Bill's proposals for south Ayrshire are adopted, there will be a minimum of eight joint boards handling services there—education social work, strategic planning and the public analyst—and we know that the same plan is outlined in the Bill for the police, fire, water and sewerage. Those arrangements, which at present could be dealt with by an all-Ayrshire authority on a directly-elected and accountable basis, are in danger of being referred to joint boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An all-Ayrshire council would be coterminous with the other main bodies in Ayrshire, including the chamber of commerce and industry. There used to be a separate Ayr chamber of commerce, and an Ayrshire chamber of industry. They came together specifically to cover the whole of the county, to achieve cohesion with the old county boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a cordial relationship with the health board now that its chairmanship has changed. I disagreed with its previous chairman, but I still co-operated closely with its chief executive and staff. The health board supports strongly the proposal for an all-Ayrshire authority because its boundary would be coterminous with the local authority's. That is important for social work provision, because the social work authority is primarily responsible for community care. It would be much easier to work with one health board and one social work authority covering the whole of Ayrshire. In addition, the tourist board, Enterprise Ayrshire and many voluntary and other bodies cover Ayrshire as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason for an all-Ayrshire authority is that that is the people's wish. I shall discuss that later in detail. Yet another, not unimportant reason, is that it is consistent with the history and identity of the local people. They feel an identity with Ayrshire. One can still see at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
the top of letters Mauchline, Ayrshire or Dalmellington, Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They still feel a community spirit and identity with the old county, even though it has not been a county since 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's consultative document gave only two options: the first an all-Ayrshire authority, the second a division between north and south, which differed from the Bill's proposals, North Ayrshire included Cunninghame and Kilmarnock and Loudoun, and south Ayrshire included Kyle and Carrick and Cumnock and Doon Valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a good response to the consultation from all over Ayrshire, as the Minister rightly acknowledges. There was a certain cynicism, in Ayrshire especially, because of previous consultations on the health trust, where not much attention was paid to local people's views. Despite that, the response was substantial. The vast majority who responded during the consultations supported an all-Ayrshire authority, with few choosing the north-south division, even as proposed in the original consultative document. No one supported the north-south division proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that Kyle and Carrick's Conservatives supported the proposal for a south Ayrshire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Ayr did not use today his arguments at public meetings in Ayrshire. That was because they did not go down very well there. He did not want the people in the higher council tax bands in Ayr, Troon, Prestwick to subsidise people in Cumnock, Kilmarnock and Oban. That did not go down at all well. I still believe that what lay behind the decision to support south Ayrshire—although nothing has been said—was that the Conservatives do not want to play their part in providing the complete range of services for the whole of the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments underpin those of the Ayrshire Makes Sense campaign. On Tuesday, the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside spoke to the amendment relating to Kincardine, Deeside and Aberdeenshire, to which the Minister accepted. There must have been powerful arguments, for the Minister to accept the amendment. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I was shown the modern secondary school, I wondered where the primary feeders for that second school were. They lie within Westhill: one lies in the rural side of Westhill, towards Echt. Its education system is self-sufficient."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 8 February 1994; c. 178.]</p></blockquote>
We said the same because, as the hon. Member for Ayr conceded, the proposed division of south Ayrshire would place Dalrymple primary school in north Ayrshire and Carrick academy, into which it feeds, in south Ayrshire. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow mentioned Tom Fulton of Dalrymple and district community council, who argued that point in his letter to us, and the letter from Richard Morton, its chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal is one of the nonsenses in non-denominational education, even before we come to the nonsenses relating to Catholic schools. The favourable argument from the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside applies here also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that is the position in Dalrymple, but that is one school that, so far as I can see, cuts across
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
all three boundaries of the new authorities. Another example is Skelmorlie-Greenock, to which I drew the Committee's attention. What is the problem? Does the hon. Gentleman think that, on that basis, we should link Ayrshire with Renfrewshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just because there is one boundary problem, there is no reason to create further problems for Dalrymple, Carrick academy or many of the Catholic primary and secondary schools in Ayrshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, as ever, makes a vigorous case for an all-Ayrshire authority. He dwelt on regional services, but what about problems with district council services such as rent alignments and council charges? If an all-Ayrshire authority were created, where would its headquarters be? If it was in Ayr, what would happen to other headquarters such as Oban, Kilmarnock or Cumnock, if they were made area offices?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his first point about housing. The old Ayrshire county council was one of the best housing authorities, with a good record—as Mr. Hemmings—an official of the old county council—would confirm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The location of the new all-Ayrshire authority headquarters would be for the newly-elected councillors to decide. They could have it in Kilmarnock, Ayr or Oban. They might consider Cumnock, for which I could argue strongly. A later clause in the Bill provides for substantial decentralisation. An authority dealing with many services need not have each department's headquarters in the same place. The education headquarters could be in one town, and the social work headquarters in another. In terms of the authority's prosperity, that seems a sensible arrangement, and should be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I have been following his case and I have listened to the representations made on behalf of the promoters. Can I ask him a question which the hon. Member for Linlithgow appears to be asking everyone? I do so not to do damage, but to gain information. Has any thought been given to the costs of creating a single authority which is the reverse of the proposal under discussion? That matter should be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said something about English Members earlier; may I add that we are grateful for the interest shown by the hon. Member for Tayside, North? His question is best answered not by me, but by the Ayrshire chamber of commerce and industry. Business men in Ayrshire will want to keep costs down. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow mentioned the letter we received from Richard Cole-Hamilton, the distinguished former head of the Clydesdale bank and a constituent of the hon. Member for Ayr. He wrote that the Ayrshire chamber of commerce and industry originally submitted views in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority. It considered the matter again and on 3 February wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we continue to hold the view as stated in our submission to Mr. Lang. An all Ayrshire single tier Local Authority is essential to the maintenance of growth in this area."</p></blockquote>
It also wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chamber is also keen to see the Government create a plan for change which has minimal initial and ongoing costs. This is of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
major concern to the business community and in any subsequent Local Government arrangement a high level of service must be closely coupled to value for money."</p></blockquote>
It believes that an all-Ayrshire, single-tier authority would be the best value for money. Proceeding with three authorities would mean three education departments and three directors of education; three social work departments and three directors of social work; three roads departments and three directors of roads. That is what the hon. Member for Ayr suggests. The chamber of commerce says that a single authority would be much more efficient. If less money is spent on central headquarters, there will be more money to spend on education in schools rather than on three education departments. If money does not have to be spent on three roads departments, there will be more money to spend on roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be anticipating the theme my hon. Friend will pursue, but it seems that the central functions from which economies of scale can be achieved are catering, cleaning, central purchasing and information technology. They will obviously be extremely costly for three small authorities. Is that another concern that the chamber of commerce and other businesses have expressed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Now that he has made the point, I do not need to make it. It also gave me a rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its submission, the chamber of commerce also wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is therefore, already existing, a very strong organisational infrastructure which is focused on Ayrshire."</p></blockquote>
That is a strong argument. I argued earlier that there is a strong feeling of identity in Ayrshire and that is endorsed by the Ayrshire chamber of commerce and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to turn now to the wishes of local people because they are important. In moving an earlier amendment, the hon. Member for Ayr said that account should be taken of the views of community councils. In replying to the previous amendment, the Minister quoted with relish and enthusiasm the views of Helensburgh community council, and others such as the Luss community council. There is a good infrastructure of community councils in Ayrshire which has worked extremely well. I hope that when we come to discuss that point later, we shall pay more attention to the role of community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the Government's proposals enhance the role of community councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I accept that. We should spend more time on that when we get to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider a random selection of community councils from different parts of Ayrshire. Earlier, the hon. Member for Ayr implied that only community councils around Hurlford supported the idea of an all-Ayrshire authority. The co-ordinating letter came from the secretary of a community council in Hurlford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dalrymple community council was mentioned earlier. Its secretary, Tom Fulton, writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There was a good turn-out of members … The Community Council re-affirmed its strong and unanimous support for an All Ayrshire authority."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
He also referred to the problem of Dalrymple primary school and made other arguments, which I shall not go into, in support of an all-Ayrshire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow is an assiduous reader of his correspondence, and he follows it up. He mentioned Mauchline community council and Eric Jackson who is its chairman. Eric Jackson wrote to us all and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are unanimous in our desire for an all-Ayrshire authority. We are against ANY division of Ayrshire. As an apolitical group of elected members we stress that this is not a party political stance but we are anxious that when reform occurs it should be the best possible solution reflecting the views of local people."</p></blockquote>
Labour Members and, I hope, Conservative Members would endorse that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prestwick community council is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ayr. It is unanimously in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority. If the hon. Member for Ayr is paying any attention to the views of the community councils in his constituency, such as the active and representative Prestwick community council, he should support amendment No. 22 for an all-Ayrshire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bellfield (Kilmarnock) community council supports the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey). It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we wish to inform you that the above Community Council do not agree with the KLDC proposal for a Mid Ayrshire Authority, nor for a split of any description as suggested in the Local Government Re-organisation Report as issued by the Scottish Office. A vote was taken at a well attended Council Meeting on the 3rd. of February regarding the options put forward by your Council"—</p></blockquote>
that is Kilmarnock and Loudoun district council—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the Scottish Office, together with a proposal for an All Ayrshire Authority. The result of the vote was unanimous or 100 per cent. in favour of an All Ayrshire Authority."</p></blockquote>
Mauchline, Dalrymple, Prestwick, Bellfield and community councils from all over Ayrshire are in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority. If the hon. Member for Ayr reflected those views, he would also support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meetings have been held in a number of centres. The hon. Member for Ayr mentioned a meeting in Ayr, which he attended and spoke at. I also spoke. The hon. Gentleman did not tell the Committee that, in spite of his eloquent address, the meeting decided almost unanimously in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority. A similar meeting in Cumnock came to the same conclusion. I understand from my hon. Friends the Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Cunninghame, South that similar meetings were held in Kilmarnock and Irvine. Again, those public meetings were overwhelmingly in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside mentioned a petition. About 10,000 people from throughout Ayrshire have taken the trouble to sign a petition supporting an all-Ayrshire authority. Community councils, public meetings and a petition all support an all-Ayrshire authority. That is the overwhelming wish of the people of Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On education, I pointed out that Bishop Maurice Taylor had expressed concern about Catholic education. I have a letter from St. Thomas' church in Muirkirk, which also expresses fears for Catholic education. It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We also have fears that the quality of education in some areas will be adversely affected. We have doubts about the ability of small councils to maintain the range and quality of services currently
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
offered. Particularly at risk will be those services geared to help the less able and the under-privileged who need our help and support."</p></blockquote>
I said earlier that smaller authorities will be less able to provide services for mentally and physically handicapped people. It is to the credit of St. Thomas's church in Muirkirk that that view has been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concluding argument may not seem as strong as some, but it stirs the hearts of many people in Ayrshire. I argued for coterminosity. I argued for the wishes of the people. I argued for the efficient and effective provision of services. I quote now from the book "Ayrshire in History" contained in the official "Book of the Pageant of Ayrshire":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ayrshire is a real geographical unit … consisting mainly of the plains, river valleys and rising ground between the great Bay of Ayr and the hills and watersheds that stretch crescent wise from about Largs in the north to the wild moorland borders of Galloway in the south."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members might not think that the "Third Statistical Account of Scotland" contains any eloquent quotations, but I read nothing else at bedtime. It is safer than reading the book written by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie)—I will never have strawberries and cream again. The "Third Statistical Account of Scotland") states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ayrshire has a unity which is noticeably lacking in most other Counties of Scotland. The County of Ayr is not only an administrative unit, but also a well-defined geographical region, and a land whose people are proud of their tradition and of their County's contribution to Scottish life and culture."</p></blockquote>
Ayrshire is a real geographical unit. I urge the Committee to restore power and authority to the county of Ayrshire, and to maintain and enhance Ayrshire as a unit. Therefore, I urge the Committee to support our proposal in amendment No. 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Scots are wise, we tiptoe gingerly into the affairs of Ayrshire. I have been extremely kindly received by the constituency Labour parties of Cunninghame, North, Cunninghame, South and Kilmarnock. They offered me nothing but superb hospitality and a warm, if critical, welcome. It must be said, however, that I have never been more terrified in my public life as when Tarbolton Bachelors Club invited me to propose the toast to "the immortal memory" of Robert Burns. When, at the end of the evening, I asked them why on earth they invited me, they smiled and said, "Curiosity."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion, I am a ventriloquist, in giving the views of my hon. Friends the Members for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe). Not everyone who wanted to serve on the Committee was able to do so. I was one of the lucky ones, but my hon. Friends had responsibilities that prevented them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is widespread support in Cunninghame for the proposition that if reorganisation is to go ahead, it should be on the basis of three authorities rather than the two proposed by the White Paper and the Bill. My colleagues in north and south Cunninghame are clear that if the heart of Ayrshire is removed by an established Kyle and Carrick authority, it makes no sense to lump the rest together and call it North Ayrshire. That would create an authority with no geographical or historical coherence, stretching from Lochranza in Arran and Skelmorlie down to places
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
such as Patna, Dalmellington and the border with Dumfries. Insult was added to injury by giving the proposed authority the quite inaccurate name of North Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is doubtless some support for an all-Ayrshire solution, and for the division of Ayrshire into three authorities if reorganisation goes ahead—but the one formula that no one wants is the two-council approach proposed by the Secretary of State. Those are the views of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North convened a public meeting in Largs last summer, immediately after publication of the White Paper. He set out his own approach—that if there is to be a single-tier local government structure, the most viable and politically attainable option to go for is Cunninghame. My hon. Friend invited all parties to be represented at that meeting, which was chaired by the editor of the 	<i>Largs and Millport Weekly News,</i> Mr. Drew Cochrane. The leader of Cunninghame district council, Mrs. Theresa Beattie, a representative of the Scottish Nationalist group, Councillor Bell, leader of the Conservative group, Mrs. Clarkson, and Lord Glasgow, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, all endorsed a Cunninghame campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It progressed from there, with the support of both local Members of Parliament, although they made it clear that they would prefer to maintain the two-tier status quo. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will recognise that there is all-party support for the amendment, which would create three Ayrshire authorities rather than two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key factor is the Government's determination to carve out Kyle and Carrick as a single-tier authority. Other calculations flow from there—and my colleagues in Cunninghame are in no doubt that if the choice is between north Ayrshire, as currently proposed, and a three-council solution, as envisaged in the amendment, they want the case for Cunninghame upheld. In my role as ventriloquist, I should make it clear that those are the views of Cunninghame district council as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, tiptoe warily into Ayrshire affairs. There is a genuine difference of opinion on the best future for Ayrshire, and that should be given voice. The current Scottish Office plan for a giant authority and a much smaller one has little support. In fact, there is outright opposition to it from several local councils and throughout Ayrshire. It would be a lopsided solution, and I oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a genuine difference of opinion about whether the all-Ayrshire or the three-council option would be the best solution. The three-council option, as proposed by the hon. Member for Ayr, has the advantage of providing a better and more balanced distribution of population. It would avoid the difficulty of the dominance of any particular authority, which is a major flaw in the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that a mid-Ayrshire authority would administer regional and district services at lower cost than its estimated current share of Strathclyde's expenditure. It could also have the advantage of reducing demands on office accommodation and staff relocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three-council proposal would take account of the diversity in Ayrshire, which differs in nature from Skelmorlie to the north to Patna in the south, and from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
Ayr in the west to Muirkirk and Darvel in the east. The Wheatley report noted the wide range of population types and communities—all of which should be recognised and catered for as part of any reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three main towns of Ayrshire are undoubtedly Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. There is, therefore, an inbuilt logic in recognising that pattern through the creation of three councils of about equal size, in terms of their population. I am sure that the Ayrshire identity would never be lost. It certainly does not require a giant council to support it. The Government's proposal for a large North Ayrshire authority has, at least, created a unanimity of opposition. It has no support from the councils that will be directly affected, local Members of Parliament or public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks are based on local advice. I oppose the Government's proposal and believe, taking that local advice into account, that the three-council solution would offer the best balance between council size provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All those who read the account of our proceedings will agree that we had an outstanding debate about a complex issue. I congratulate all four hon. Members on their speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate was rather different from those about boundaries because previous discussions concerned important but relatively limited issues. We have just examined a fundamental issue of structure, about which reasonable people can disagree between and across parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, supported by the hon. Member for Linlithgow who spoke on behalf of the hon. Members for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe), and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), put forward arguments for splitting Ayrshire into three, which would add to the number of Scottish local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley for his kind reference to the meeting that I had with his delegation. I accept that there are honest and honourable people on both sides of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government initially received more than 60 responses that commented on Ayrshire. The comments made then by the four district councils served to highlight the conflicting arguments. Kyle and Carrick presented a strong case for unitary status on the basis of being an enabling council. Kilmarnock and Loudoun district council also favoured unitary status, with the possibility of taking in adjacent areas. Cunninghame district council favoured a single Ayrshire, as did Cumnock and Doon Valley district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal for north and south Ayrshire in the Bill is set out against that background of divided opinion. It is, therefore, a compromise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accurately outlined the council's views, but does he accept that not just councillor's views are important for local government? The views of the churches, voluntary and other organisations and, above all, the people of Ayrshire are also important. Councillors sometimes have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Does the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
accept that there is an overwhelming view among outside bodies in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's first point. I was about to say that although the councils' views are important, so are the views of organisations and individuals. The hon. Gentleman referred to a number of bodies in the public and private sectors that favour an all-Ayrshire authority. However, after the White Paper was published—I am not saying that this is decisive—the Government received 175 letters from organisations, community councils and individuals—and about 135 favoured the three-way split advocated by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have offered a compromise. The arguments about cost are not necessarily decisive. Cunninghame argued that a three-tier system would be less expensive than the proposed two-tier system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am an honest man, so I accept what the hon. Member for Angus, East said about the popularity of the north Ayrshire option proposed in the White Paper and the Bill. There has not been massive popular support for the concept, but sometimes compromises must be made. The arguments in favour of a North Ayrshire authority as proposed were that it would be strong and able to develop specialist services. It would therefore be of great assistance to smaller authorities elsewhere in west central Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That view is perfectly tenable, and there is much to be said for the Government's admittedly compromised proposals. One must make a judgment in such matters. The Committee listened most attentively to excellent speeches. We have heard from delegations that put forward their points of view, honestly and with a great deal of work and commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members must make up their own minds on the options before them. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley made a powerful, eloquent and well-researched speech and several valid points—I would not deny that for a moment. For myself, in reflecting the balance of voices in this debate, I ask the Committee to support amendment No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this highly significant group of amendments, which have far-reaching implications for not only the border regions but the whole of south-east Scotland and the Lothians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 would return Berwickshire to the Borders council area. I propose to concentrate on the Border region issue. Should my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian catch your eye, Mr. Martin, I am sure that he will develop his own arguments about the rest of the areas concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 is likely to be the most significant amendment that I shall ever move in my entire parliamentary career. It is the most important public issue, with the highest salience in public interest terms, to be raised in Berwickshire in living memory. I remind the Committee that not only will the 20,000 souls who live in Berwickshire be directly affected by the Committee's decision tonight, but, indirectly, the other 80,000 people who live in the rest of the length and breadth of the Borders region. There will be a knock-on effect also, as for other parts of the Lothian as a consequence of amendments Nos. 23 and 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have background knowledge of the issues involved in the amendments because they received correspondence to which they have given due consideration. I have also received some reports, to which I shall advert later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easy to speak at length and emotionally about the amendments. I could even—heaven forbid—make a party political case against the Government's plans in the Bill. The Committee may be relieved to hear that I shall not do any of that. There are three simple matters that I wish to explore. First, I shall examine the proposals in the Bill and how they were developed. Secondly, I shall give the Committee a flavour of the opposition to the proposals among local people. Thirdly, I shall examine possible alternative solutions to the problem that the Government could consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the Borders, and especially in Berwickshire, were shocked when they found that they were to be linked with East Lothian when the Government published the document "Shaping the Future—The New Councils" in July 1993. The upsurge of local opposition can only be described as spontaneous and unprecedented. The people in the Mears are canny and independent and, typified by the hon. Member for East Lothian. They are not given to high profile histrionics, although that may not be quite so true of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average person from Berwickshire is not given to high-level political activity. We deal with matters more subtly in south-east Scotland. But to a man and woman they rose up, without prompting from the machinery or organisation of any political party, against the Government's proposals. There was even a demo outside the Berwickshire district council offices in Duns market
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
square on the day that that council met to consider its response to the proposals. People carried loudhailers—indeed, the deputy vice-lieutenant of the Berwickshire lieutenancy was seen to be using one to great effect in his address to the hundreds of people who had foregathered to make it known that they considered the proposals to be fundamentally flawed. The meeting actually made it to the national evening news bulletins. Nothing of the kind has ever happened before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With or without a loudhailer, I have never had as much success in getting Berwickshire people to listen to me at public meetings. A few weeks later, there was a follow-up at the Duns agricultural show. I do not know whether the Minister has ever attended that show. I know that the hon. Member for East Lothian has, because he is regularly harangued there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I have not attended that show, and it sounds as if that is just as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. The Duns agricultural show was held in the last week of last August. A thousand people occupied the ring to protest against the plans. It may interest members of the Committee that that outrage and disquiet about the Government's plans is as acute today as it was in July. The Government began to consult people when they launched their White Paper in October 1992. The document was entitled "Shaping the Future—the New Councils". People in the borders participated in the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Committee will mind if I try to make a little more progress. There will be a series of Divisions in the House at 10 pm and, between now and then, I hope that we can break the back of this important group of amendments. I shall work on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period of consultation that was initiated in October 1992 by the Government on the publication of the White Paper was entered into in good faith by people in the Borders region. They noted, however, that when the Secretary of State introduced the White Paper at a press conference he said—because he was specifically asked—that he was prepared to listen to people's views and that, if people took the trouble to let him know what they thought about his proposals, he would respond to them positively. We took careful note of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, submissions were subsequently made by the regional council and the three district councils of Tweeddale, Berwickshire and Roxburgh; consultants were engaged to assist them in that process. The district council of Ettrick and Lauderdale made its own submission. A range of arguments was advanced for a variety of options but, from all those consultations and public debates, two things became crystal clear. First, no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
one but no one in the Borders wanted to sever the links between the Borders regional council and the district of Berwickshire. No one publicly argued for the proposition that Berwickshire should somehow be separated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for East Lothian reminds me, there were some arguments. Some people said that Borders and East Lothian should be knocked together into an all-embracing unitary authority, but I do not think that their arguments carried much weight or conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a clear consensus emerged for a unitary authority based on the Borders regional council area. How the idea to join Berwickshire to East Lothian emerged in the first place is still a matter of puzzlement and concern. Whose idea was it? No one has confessed to its authorship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If change is to be embraced—the Government's plans involve the maximum change, certainly for the Borders region—the onus lies on the Government to show how local government would be better with a Berwick and East Lothian set-up. That case has signally not been made at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the Minister made himself available to meet a local delegation, as he has done to meet others. The three people who were admitted to the ministerial presence in my company consisted of two distinguished people who, far from not being party political, were distinguished, long-serving members of the local Conservative association—although that may rapidly change unless the Minister gets the decision right this evening—and the third member was the indefatigable Councillor John Elliot who is an independent councillor in Berwickshire district council: he of the pork-pie hat and the "Keep Berwickshire in the Borders" T-shirt, together with kilt and sundry other effective methods of propaganda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may accept that, at that meeting, those three people made an effective case for the status quo. They used their best endeavours to get from the Minister and the Government the reasons for the proposition to link Berwickshire and East Lothian. It boiled down to the fact that, previously, Berwick and East Lothian had been a parliamentary constituency—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, it was well represented by my distinguished constituent, the hon. Member for East Lothian; I have to be nice to him because he owns half of Berwickshire!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second proposition was that agricultural links existed north and south of the divide between Berwick and East Lothian. To me that seems to be the political equivalent of saying that tomorrow is Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the district councils had produced a consultants report, from which the Minister drew selectively in order to adduce the case for putting Berwick and East Lothian together. Fourthly, he ended by saying rather weakly that he cannot please everyone. That was probably the most convincing reason of the four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say in parentheses—technically this is out of order, but I hope that I will be allowed a small indulgence—that the changes proposed in the amendments and the consequences for the Boundary Commission have a direct significance. As the Minister rightly said, active consideration is being given to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
parliamentary constituency of Berwick and East Lothian. I have to tell the Minister, in case he has not already heard, that when the public inquiry on the proposal to link Berwickshire with East Lothian was convened in Galashiels, almost 400 people attended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not with loudhailers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not with loudhailers, but there was loud applause, stamping of feet and cheering in an unprecedented inquiry, the results of which will be considered tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, it has happened. I am behind the times by only 24 hours this time. The Committee's decision will have serious consequences for the parliamentary boundary commissioners. I hope that they will take our deliberations into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the keep Berwickshire in the Borders delegation left the Minister after their meeting, they were none the wiser about the source of the proposals and the justification for them. Locally we are still puzzled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local reaction to the proposal to remove Berwickshire from the Borders council area could be described as adverse. I was lucky enough to persuade my local constituency party—I confess that the party paid for it—to employ a company, PS Opinion Research, which is skilled in this business and does telephone marketing and polling for commercial firms such as Mercury. My local party arranged for a telephone survey of 500 households in the district of Berwickshire. The most significant finding was that the canvassers could not get people off the phone because they demanded to be heard and to have their views recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 5 of that survey asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Thinking about the Berwickshire District Council as a whole would you describe Berwickshire as naturally being part of the Borders or the Lothians?".</p></blockquote>
In reply, 473 out of the 500–95 per cent.—said the Borders, 19 households—3.8 per cent.—said the Lothians, and 1 per cent. said that they did not know or had no opinion. When a scientifically selected, random authence in the borders district were asked where they thought their interest lay and whether Berwickshire belonged to the Borders or the Lothians, they gave a clear, categorical, incontrovertible answer. People have therefore made their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pay tribute to the ad hoc committee. It was not a politically-inspired campaign, as the Secretary of State sought disingenuously, to suggest on the Floor of the House. It was set up by the Keep Berwickshire in the Borders campaign and it orchestrated the dissemination of information to the public. It did a splendid job, as did the Tweedale press group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That well-known radical group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That well-known radical newspaper group also played a fearless role and kept people advised of what was happening. The Minister gave the Committee helpful advice about the number of letters that he had received and the various questions being considered by us today. What is the sum total to date of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
the number of letters that he has received on this issue? At the last count some months ago it was a high proportion of the total number of letters received from all over Scotland. Indeed, it is giving the Post Office good business and keeping rural post offices busy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should be aware that feelings against the proposals are still running as high as they were when they were first announced. The Borders region has produced a good document. It has played a distinguished role in the public debate. It has produced a document, which has been circulated to members of the Committee, called "Shaping the New Councils". Lord Minto is the convenor of Borders region and a very respected figure in local government throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. He made an impassioned speech. Unfortunately I was not present, but people who heard it said that it was the speech of his life. He made known the council's view when it set out its objections to these plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document shows the massive and widespread support for the view that Borders council should cover the whole of the existing Borders area. That has the support of the regional council, three of the four district councils, the vast majority of community councils, Scottish Borders Enterprise, Borders health board, Borders further education college, Scottish Borders Tourist Board, the Borders area of the National Farmers Union, a number of large companies and organisations and an overwhelming majority of Borderers. It is important to put that on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keep Berwickshire in the Borders campaign has produced another document, which was also circulated to the Committee. I draw hon. Members' attention to the information contained in sheet 12, which is at the back of the document. It lists almost 100 Border-wide organisations, such as the Borders regional wind orchestra, in which my 14-year-old daughter plays the second bassoon to great effect—I hear her practising and so can the neighbours. If the proposal is accepted, that orchestra would not be able to draw its participants from the whole of the Border region, so its membership would be decimated. That is only one example of many set out in the list of organisations that operate in a cross-Borders context, from the Borders Machinery ring to the Borders Vintage Agricultural Society and the Borders regional intermediate choir. A range of Borders organisations would be affected by these changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local reaction has made it clear that local people have a true Border identity. There are historical reasons for that, which have been built up over many years of fighting the English, being beaten by them, and marrying into their families and taking them over that way. It is a geographical entity, in which there is a sense of community and a distinct, free-standing economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local people feel that they are Border folk. That perception is a real one and the Government's plans diminish their identity and status. It is true and fair to say that local people are not well disposed to these plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are available alternatives. I accept that some of the amendments embrace significant change; they are not small, minor amendments. They would change the Government's proposals significantly. Operating within their own guidelines, the Government could strike a compromise to satisfy the wishes of the people in the Borders region and in Berwickshire district in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
The amendments would allow Berwickshire to remain within the Borders council area. They would either allow East Lothian and Midlothian to be free-standing unitary authorities if the Government thought that that was right and proper, or, as an alternative, East Lothian and Midlothian could be combined to form a new Lothian unitary authority. The deletion of the famous—or infamous—Balerno corridor, would allow the creation of a free-standing unitary authority in West Lothian. I acknowledge that suggestion may not please the people of Midlothian and East Lothian, which they believe should be recognised in their own right, and have free-standing authorities. That is a matter for the Government. However, arguments exist about counterbalancing the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were accepted, we would be left with the Lothians, which have a population of approximately 165,000 and west Lothian, which has a population of about 146,000. The Government will pay a high price in increased public cynicism about democracy if they do not accommodate opinion in Berwickshire by accepting changes to their plans. Ordinary people should have a say. If the Government try to amalgamate Berwickshire and East Lothian, the cost of transition will be enormous. It would cost almost nothing to leave Berwickshire where it belongs. If the Minister concedes the Borders case, I will give the Government credit for being big enough to listen to local people. We shall be stronger for coming together to fight and to present robust and positive opposition to the Government's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a decision. We cannot countenance further delay and uncertainty. It is unfair to the staff and to members of the public who will be affected by the plans. The Minister has the future of 20,000 people in my constituency in his hands. He has the ability directly to affect their fate for the foreseeable future. I plead with him to reconsider the Government's proposals and to accept the alternatives that the amendments suggest. If the Minister gets it right, he will deserve credit. If he gets it wrong, his mistake will return to haunt him. The people of Berwickshire will take a long time to forgive him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is fairly complicated. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire for his introduction. Like him, I hope that the solution will take account of the interests and aspirations of people throughout Lothian and the Borders regions, as far as that is possible given the unsatisfactory framework for local government reform in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to create a new authority named "the Lothians", which would include bits of East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian. They propose also a Berwickshire and East Lothian authority. We shall consider alternatives for the areas north and south of the Lammermuirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is speculation about Government motives for splitting East Lothian district between a Lothians authority, probably based in Livingston, and the so-called Berwickshire and East Lothian authority, which would include the Borders district of Berwickshire. Goodness knows where the headquarters of the Berwickshire and East Lothian authority would be based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
The region's geographical centre is 1,000 ft up the Lammermuirs in a deserted place called the Hungry Snout [HON. MEMBERS: "Have you been there?"] Yes. We went there to try to find the epicentre of Berwickshire and East Lothian. It is not a good idea to build a new headquarters there, although that would be as logical as anything else in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is manifestly untrue to suggest that the proposal for a Berwickshire and East Lothian authority arose from public consultation. That proposal, more than any other, led to charges of gerrymandering. However, I do not want to become involved in a slanging match with the Minister—we must think our way out of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that the proposed Berwickshire and East Lothian authority is unwanted, unworkable and incomprehensible. The county of East Lothian has never in recorded history formed part of the same local administrative area as Berwickshire. At present the two districts have separate local authorities, separate health boards and trusts, separate offices of the Department of Social Security and separate local enterprise companies. They are in different travel-to-work areas and even receive different television signals—one cannot get the same news on television in Berwickshire as one can in east Lothian. They have different local radio stations and a different local press. They are even in different National Farmers Union areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two areas are effectively divided by the Lammermuir hills. There is only one all-weather road linking them—the A1 trunk road on the east coast at Cockburnspath. There is a direct road across the Lammermuirs from Haddington to Duns, but it is a single track road with passing places, at least six cattle grids and no fences. Lothian regional council tells me that it has been blocked by snow about five times a year for at least two to three days at a time for the past 10 years. It is not altogether surprising that no buses run on that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the unlikely event of one of my constituents from Cockenzie travelling to Coldstream at the other end of the proposed new local authority area in the constituency of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, the journey would involve two changes, would take five hours and would cost £10.50. There is only one bus route down the A1 and not many buses use the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One outlandish suggestion was that a common factor between Berwickshire and East Lothian is the east coast main railway line. Superficially that looks interesting, but as there is no railway station in Berwickshire, the only way of getting by train from East Lothian to Berwickshire would be to pull the emergency stop handle, which is rather expensive. The only link is the A1 trunk road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the subject. We have been trying to find the missing link—apart from myself—between Berwickshire and East Lothian. We should consider the communication on the A1 road, which is the single link between the two areas. In a written answer the Minister told me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The average annual daily traffic on the A1 between the Lothian/Borders boundary … in 1992 was 6,300 vehicles per day. The volume of local traffic with an origin or destination in Borders region is estimated from junction counts and other surveys to be around 1,200 vehicles per day. It is not possible from the information available to identify the proportion of that traffic which is undertaking local journeys between east Lothian and Berwickshire."</p></blockquote>
As the figure of 1,200 vehicles a day includes traffic going from the Borders to Edinburgh, the local traffic travelling between East Lothian and Berwickshire is certainly fewer than 1,000 vehicles a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the area further up the A1, at the other end of my constituency where the Government propose to create a new, artificial boundary chopping off part of East Lothian, the Minister told me in another written answer that the average daily traffic flow is
	<br><blockquote><p>"14,800 vehicles on the A198. On the A1 at Meadowmill some 10,600 vehicles per day … is traffic travelling from or to the surrounding area between Musselburgh and Haddington. On the A198 at Meadowmill, about 99 per cent. is local traffic."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 26 October 1993; Vol. 230, c.614–5.]</p></blockquote>
That means that in the area in which the Government propose to make a boundary, the daily traffic flow is 25,400, but in the areas that the Government want to bring together, the traffic flow is fewer than 1,000 vehicles a day. That shows clearly that the boundary that the Government propose does not make sense and that the unity that they propose is purely artificial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on and on, giving more and more reasons why there is no community of interest between East Lothian and Berwickshire. I am particularly qualified to say that because not only am I a resident of Berwickshire and Member of Parliament for East Lothian, but I have five years' experience of being the Member of Parliament for the former constituency of Berwickshire and East Lothian. The two areas have very little in common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has said, Berwickshire has strong historical, physical and economic ties with the rest of the Borders, while Musselburgh has equally strong ties with the rest of East Lothian. I live in Berwickshire, and, having seen the clear and overwhelming expressions of public opinion in the county over the past seven months, I strongly agree with the hon. Gentleman that Berwickshire belongs to the Borders and that there it should remain. The Borders, including Berwickshire, has a population of 104,000. It has an established pattern of administration and services and it should be left intact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents in East Lothian have been horrified by the proposal. They have made it overwhelmingly clear that they do not want their district broken up. The Minister will recall that I met him on 1 October last year with a deputation of people from every part of East Lothian and from several political parties. They all supported the case that East Lothian should be kept together. We were grateful for our courteous reception by the Minister at the old St. Andrew's house. We had with us 13,881 cards from local people expressing their opinion about the threat to take Musselburgh, Prestonpans and Wallingford out of East Lothian. Of that total, 13,462–96.89 per cent.—opposed the division of East Lothian, while 419—just over 3 per cent.—supported it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
In an earlier debate, the Minister was a little disparaging about petitions. However, this was not a petition collected by canvassers. People had to go out to libraries and to council offices to collect the cards, or they had to cut out a section from local newspapers. They had to fill in their names and addresses, add their signatures, express their opinion on the proposed division of East Lothian, and then return the completed cards to their district councils. The cards were counted by the staff who conduct parliamentary election counts in East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having witnessed the count, I can tell the Committee that it was pretty rigorous. Any card that looked spurious was rejected. The number of cards returned was equivalent to a quarter of the electorate in the area, and 97 per cent. of that very substantial sample wants East Lothian to be kept together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as submitting those cards to the Minister at the 1 October meeting, the deputation made a vigorous case for keeping East Lothian together, citing the views of local business and particularly the views of the 60-strong East Lothian business club. I shall quote from a letter from Stuart Ross, the managing director of Belhaven brewery, whose product I strongly recommend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The firm recently was the subject of a management buy-out. It is based in Dunbar, quite near the Berwickshire boundary, and one might have thought that the firm would have some sympathy with the proposed union with Berwickshire. However, Stuart Ross wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Belhaven Brewery firmly supports the retention of the existing boundaries of East Lothian. Our customer base is primarily located in Lothian Region, Strathclyde Region and the Central Belt of Scotland and we feel it would be a disadvantage, from the point of view of customer service, to be perceived as being located in the Borders. We feel comfortable within East Lothian, even although our location is on the eastern periphery of the district, and over the past few years we have enjoyed a mutually beneficial and very positive relationship with East Lothian District Council who have assisted us in addressing various matters relating to the development of Belhaven Brewery. We have also received excellent guidance from other organisations within the Lothians, notably LEEL, and we would be disappointed to lose the contacts which we have made and the relationships which we have fostered. We can see no positive benefits accruing from the government's proposal that the eastern part of East Lothian should be conjoined with Berwickshire as part of the reform of local government."</p></blockquote>
I stress that the representations in support of the retention of the integrity of East Lothian come from every part of the district, including Musselburgh. The Minister sought to distinguish between Musselburgh and the rest of East Lothian on the grounds that Musselburgh was a Midlothian borough until 1974. It is important to emphasise that Musselburgh—the "honest toon"—joined East Lothian after careful consideration by the Wheatley commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Wheatley was a former Member of Parliament for Musselburgh and I am sure that he had the area's best interests at heart. Musselburgh has been a welcome and wholehearted member of the East Lothian community for 20 years, as is evidenced by the fact that the present convener of East Lothian district council, George Wanless, is a Labour councillor from Musselburgh. Certainly, Musselburgh has no desire to be cut adrift from East Lothian and that is evidenced by the strong showing of cards from Musselburgh that were among those which we handed to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
That was more clearly demonstrated when more than 1,000 people and three bands marched through Musselburgh on 11 September 1993 to support the East Lothian standing firm campaign. The rally was addressed by Nigel Tranter, by the Tory ex-provost of Musselburgh, Bill Caird, and by the Labour convenor, George Wanless. A similar rally was held in Prestonpans on 28 August. The campaign has been an impressive demonstration of the positive commitment to East Lothian from the whole district—from Dunbar to Tranent and from the rest of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the meeting on 1 October, the Minister offered just three points to support the Government's plans. First, Musselburgh and Prestonpans were mining communities that had more in common with West Lothian and Midlothian. Secondly, the rest of East Lothian is rural with an economy based on farming, fishing and tourism. Therefore, it has more in common with Berwickshire. Thirdly, there was a parliamentary constituency of Berwick and East Lothian from 1918 to 1983, and that there might be such a constituency again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arguments are pretty flimsy. Parliamentary boundaries are supposed to take account of local authority boundaries—not the other way round. In any case, having taken part in the inquiry into the future of parliamentary boundaries, I would be astonished if the commissioners at their meeting today decide to proceed with their provisional idea of a new Berwick and East Lothian constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rural and mining connections, the whole of East Lothian is developing a far more diverse economy with indigenous industries and a growing pattern of commuting to work in Edinburgh. The mining industry has been practically killed off by the Government and East Lothian's only working coal production facility—the Blindwells open cast site—would be on the wrong side of the boundary that the Minister is proposing. It would be in the rural local authority while one of our main fishing communities—Fisherrow in Musselburgh—would fall into the mining authority. That argument does not make much sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial proposed boundary would have split the catchment area of Preston Lodge high school. It would have run between Cockenzie power station and its coal plant to the puzzlement of Scottish Power. I acknowledge that that boundary has been adjusted in a token concession by the Secretary of State, but we still have the crazy proposition of a new boundary dividing Musselburgh from Prestonpans and Tranent and Whitecraig from Wallyford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those boundaries would have an impact on important services. Assuming that the new authorities have concessionary travel schemes, pensioners from towns such as Tranent would be able to get travel concessions to Duns, but not to Musselburgh. A pensioner from Wallyford would be able to get a cheap fare to Bathgate across the Balerno gap, but not to Haddington, which is just down the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sprawling detached Lothians authority does not make sense as it stands. The Berwickshire and East Lothian council would be absurd. It would contain only 76,000 people, scattered over a naturally divided area. It could not possibly provide a proper range of services at reasonable cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
With regard to amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 35, I said earlier that I would infinitely prefer to leave existing authorities to get on with their work until we set up a Scottish Parliament. When we have that Parliament, we may be able to move to smaller, more local, single-tier authorities. The Bill compels us to strike a compromise between what is truly local and what can provide the services that people require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Services are very important. I have received many letters from constituents about the need for special education for handicapped children. That may be lost if the regions disappear and we return to smaller authorities. Concessionary travel is another issue that has been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Services require resources and a population base. The average population of the new councils will be 200,000. Unless smaller councils have a guarantee of special financial support, they are likely to have poorer services, a higher council tax or, possibly, both. I fear that a single-tier East Lothian with just 85,000 people could suffer all the problems that we are predicting for the other smaller authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would create a twin East and Midlothian council, with a population of 167,000 people and a West Lothian council, with 150,000 people, on either side of the city of Edinburgh district, with 435,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In East Lothian, we have been concentrating on the need to fight off the unwanted division of our district and the absurd proposal to join the two bits, with Berwickshire on the one hand, and West Lothian on the other. I admit that comparatively little thought has been given to possible alternative partnerships, so I shall have to take personal responsibility for the compromise formula and, if necessary, face the consequences in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the suggestion of an East and Midlothian partnership publicly on two occasions, first in a statement on 23 October 1992 and secondly in a speech in the House on 14 July 1993.I note that Midlothian district council is supporting the solution, although I do not know whether it has consulted the people of the district. Since the White Paper was published, we know that, in addition to the views expressed by Midlothian district council, West Lothian district council is opposed to its curious union across the Balerno gap with Midlothian. I consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke) about the proposals and he supports the solution that I propose in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are demonstrable connections between East Lothian and Midlothian and I offer the amendments as a way out of the Government's absurd anomalies of the Balerno corridor and the Lammermuir gap. I hope that my constituents will forgive me, but there are times when a Member of Parliament must exercise a difficult judgment. The proposals may be the best way forward for strong local government and good service provision for my constituents and for those people elsewhere in Lothian and in the Borders. In that spirit, I submit the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituency faces the constituency of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a certain locus to speak in the Committee. In addition, friends of the hon. Member for Angus East are visiting my constituency, according to the Sunday newspapers, to distribute leaflets. I think that I am entitled to speak, at least briefly, about this particular issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his criticism, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire was unfair to my hon. Friend the Minister, and those who draw up the original document, "The Structure of Local Government in Scotland". If the lessons of history are wiped away, there is no doubt that Berwickshire would have been linked with East Lothian. To claim that Berwickshire has been part of the Borders is a misnomer. Berwickshire, and the people of Berwickshire, have always stood up to be independent from the border. They are akin to the people of north Northumberland in many ways, because of the nature of the agriculture and communications there. The town that they look to is Berwick-upon-Tweed, which we still have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must criticise the campaign run by Borders regional council. Its document—well produced as it is—is more a defence of Borders regional council than an attempt to find a solution to a difficult problem with which my hon. Friend and his officials have had to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the people of Berwickshire have always stood out from the Borders. The country is very different from that of Roxburgh, Peebles and Selkirk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is completely different, geographically. The people of Berwickshire realise that, in the way in which local government works today, they could not exist by themselves. So, they have a difficult decision—that between the devil and the deep blue sea. The area will either go into the constituency of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) or join something that it is used to in the Borders regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and his officials, because of the logic in the circumstances, did not realise and would not have anticipated the outcry from the community about being linked to East Lothian. If there was a fate worse than death for the people of the Borders, that is it. The outcry was justified because people believed that, if they had to join others, it would be better to remain in the, albeit different, community of the Borders than to go to East Lothian in the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment because it is the least worst option and Berwickshire would be better off remaining in the Borders community. My hon. Friend the Government Whip, who lives in north Northumberland, but is prevented from speaking by the rule of omertà in the House, has a strong-interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider the amendment favourable? I do not want to discuss the domino effect that it might have, but it would be much appreciated in Berwickshire if he could sort out the effects of a change to his plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether we can take the hon. Gentleman's speech as a trailer for some coming attraction. No doubt we shall find out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals were badly conceived. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire pointed that out in detail. He knows his area and how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
ill-conceived the scheme is. Splitting Midlothian and West Lothian with a land corridor and forgetting the geographical reality of the Lammermuir hills does not strike me as a good idea, but that is what the Government want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments, which set out a much more sensible relationship between Midlothian and East Lothian and between Berwickshire and the Borders. West Lothian continuing as an individual local authority is justified and will prove its worth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals have stirred up far more controversy than anything else in the boundary changes and the controversy is justified. I congratulate the people of the Borders for the lively and organised defence of their unique and characteristic local government needs. I hope the the Government will listen to the strong and rational case that has been made on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposed Lothian council would comprise two separate halves nine miles apart by road and without a common boundary between the two areas of West Lothian and Midlothian. The two parts are to be separated by the physical barriers of the city of Edinburgh and the Pentland hills, neither of which are insubstantial. It plainly is daft to set up a new council that does not have a direct transport link between West Lothian and Midlothian. If it happens, at least road priorities will be preordained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's Lothian proposal is patently inappropriate, if not downright schizophrenic, and I hope that it will be abandoned. It is plain that such a council would serve neither of its masters well. I support the amendment's concept of a Midlothian and an East Lothian and the obvious fact that West Lothian is a natural, compact and recognisable area of government that would more than justify its continuing as an excellent individual local authority. I hope that that is what the Minister will announce. It is what he should announce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
West Lothian, with a population of 146,000, is clearly a viable unit that is well able to deliver cost-effective services alongside, not welded to, the other obvious combination of Midlothian and East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Borders—and here I include Berwickshire—is one of Scotland's treasures. A unique community lies behind the natural boundary of the Lammermuirs, the Pentland hills, the Cheviots and the Tweedsmuir hills in the area to the Tweed and the North sea. The Minister must surely recognise the power and sincerity as well as the good sense that has characterised the campaign to retain Berwickshire and the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words of the two local hon. Members and ask the Minister to look at the amendments as a package that meets and reflects the local government needs of those involved. The Government's present plans have been totally rejected by those communities. The answer, fortunately, is easy to discern. It has been presented to the Government in the form of the amendments: the sensible solution is to have a West Lothian, Midlothian and East Lothian council and for the Borders to be linked with Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in the interests of good management, recognised community units and geographical reality that I support the amendments. I ask the Government to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my voice to the calls for a single Borders authority, as the only Committee member born and brought up there and then sent to Glasgow on a mission to civilise. I passed the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire going the other way; he was born in Glasgow and ended up in the Borders. It is obvious that as ever,Govan, got the best of the deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A strong and vigorous campaign has been fought in the Borders which I greatly admire. I should like to quote from one strongly argued and passionate letter from Councillor William D. Smith. He explains the objective case and concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I'm sure we'll have your help—otherwise I'll need to see your faither".</p></blockquote>
In those circumstances what can I do but urge the Minister to accept the case for a united Borders council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and reasoned debate about the new structure for Lothians and the Borders.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A frisson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A frisson of controversy about the historic and unique link between Berwickshire and East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members have said, I met with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and a delegation, which I accept comprised genuine citizens with no party-political axe to grind. I also met the hon. Member for East Lothian, representatives of that council and community and the hon. Members for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the preference of the hon. Member for Livingston was for the retention of Lothian region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can confirm that. The line I have taken with hon. Ministers is that they and delegations have the right of access to Ministers. That does not mean that they are necessarily putting forward their first preference, nor does it mean that they necessarily wholly associate themselves with the representations of the council. Those delegations are a legitimate and automatic channel of access to Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also aware of the views of Midlothian district council. I would be content with a council with the existing boundaries, one which extended into East Lothian or with a complete link-up with East Lothian. I listened carefully to all the arguments that were advanced. Each of the delegations' proposals would substantially change the structure of the Bill. I emphasised to the delegations that the Bill would largely reflect the structure set out in the White Paper, with one or two minor changes. I explained that if any changes were to be made to the proposals set out in the White Paper they should properly be considered by Parliament and, in particular, by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to create separate authorities for the Lothians and for Berwickshire and East Lothian stemmed from the Government's belief that, wherever practicable, the major cities should be counterbalanced by surrounding or neighbouring authorities of sufficient size. The validity of that point was recognised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. It was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
important not to create many small authorities that might be subservient to their populous city neighbours. With the completion of the city bypass, communication links between West Lothian and Midlothian are good. I accept, however, that most public transport links between the two areas are via Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to the reasons that we gave for our choice of boundaries. They included the fact that there is an authority along the A1. There are rural connections and there are similarities in economic and social structure. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) pointed out, in a welcome contribution to the debate, the differences between Berwickshire and the rest of the Borders. That was reflected in some of the submissions that we received. I reassure him that we are not considering linking Berwickshire and Northumberland. His comments were based on considerable knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked me particularly about responses that we had received since the White Paper was published. We have received about 400 letters from Berwickshire. That is 20 per cent. of the total in Scotland. We received about 3,000 petition signatures, pro forma letters and postcards. From East Lothian we received about 100 letters. The Standing Firm campaign, to which the hon. Member for East Lothian referred, sent us about 14,000 cards and from West Lothian and Midlothian we received about 180 letters, together with 1,475 representations in the form of petitions and postcards from West Lothian. As I said before, we have to take account of public opinion, although we cannot please all the people all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allegations have been made—although not in this debate—that the Government are not prepared to listen to the public or to Opposition Members, that only minor concessions would be made in Committee and that those would be to my hon. Friends. I have never accepted that criticism and I will prove my point. I know that our proposals have stimulated much debate. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has put his case clearly. I therefore inform him that the Government are prepared to accept that Berwickshire should form part of the Borders authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cases advanced by the people of Midlothian and West Lothian also lead me to conclude that a unitary West Lothian authority should be established. The remaining part of the package relates to the area covered by the districts of East Lothian and Midlothian. The hon. Member for East Lothian referred to representations that
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
he and I had received about a single-tier East Lothian council. The amendments propose a single authority covering the whole of this area which would be called, perhaps somewhat awkwardly, East and Midlothian. I do not wish to hold up the other changes that I mentioned by resisting the amendments that would create that authority. The hon. Members may regard it as reasonable if we reserved the right to consider the structure in this area, perhaps as the Bill proceeds through Parliament. With that reservation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister kindly spell out precisely what that means? He makes sympathetic noises and speaks in general terms. Will he say precisely what he wants us to do and his specific recommendation on the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am in the process of doing that, very quickly indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reservation is that we might want to examine the case for separate Midlothian and East Lothian councils. I accept the general verdict of the hon. Member for East Lothian, however, that that might create councils that were too small in relation to the city of Edinburgh. I simply say to the hon. Member for Hamilton that we reserve the right to come back to the matter, possibly as the Committee proceeds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister should consider the matter further, does that mean that he would be prepared to take part in further meetings with people from the areas involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I confirm that we are prepared to consider the matter further and to hold additional meetings.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply wish to say that we acknowledge with gratitude the fact that the Minister has listened to public opinion.
