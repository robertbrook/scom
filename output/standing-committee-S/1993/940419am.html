	<time>Tuesday 19 April 1994</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. It relates to an article that appeared in the 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> newspaper on 17 April. It is headlined, "Climbdown on schools chiefs" and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The government has conceded that the posts"</p></blockquote>
—that is, of directors of education—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be re-instated as a statutory requirement in the Local Government Reform Bill currently progressing through Parliament."</p></blockquote>
You will perhaps recall, Sir James, that in the debate on that matter the Government made it clear that they had no intention of making a statutory requirement in relation to directors of education. Therefore, could you provide an opportunity for the Minister to make an early statement to the Committee on whether the article is correct and, if it is, why a statutory requirement relating to directors of social work is not included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. It may help the Committee if I briefly reply on this matter. I saw the article in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> which suggested that the Government have it in mind to reinstate the statutory requirement that an education authority must appoint a director of education. I make it clear that there is no substance to that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 8 March, we had a full debate in Committee on whether the statutory requirement should be retained. In that debate, I stressed that we do not believe in unnecessary prescription. I further stressed that we wished to give the new authorities the freedom to choose and the power to manage themselves. That remains the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, it will be open to education authorities to appoint directors of education, if they so wish. But it is not our intention to force them so to do if, in their particular circumstances and in line with their own judgment on which they will be held accountable by their electorates, they do not wish to do so. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. On each occasion when we debated clauses 60 to 120, relating to water, and in reply to Opposition statements that large numbers of people in Scotland had indicated a preference for an alternative to the Government's proposal—that is, that directly elected councils should be in charge of water in Scotland—the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) consistently said that that was not so and that the majority of people who had submitted
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1860</span>
postcards in petition to the Government had not specified an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an example of the postcards that were submitted and that were published by the Labour party at Church street, Inverkeithing. Each card is personally signed and specifically states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I therefore call on the Government to maintain a properly funded water and sewerage service under the control of the locally elected councils."</p></blockquote>
I have promised the Minister a copy of the card. Plainly, either he was ill informed by his civil servants or he misread the postcards and so inadvertently misled the Committee for two weeks during those debates. Therefore, would it be in order, Sir James, for the Minister—I notice that he has put the postcard in his left-hand pocket—to read it to the Committee, to admit that he received 95,000 individual postcards on the matter and that he has inadvertently misled the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has heard what the hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my point of order, Sir James. Is it in order for the Minister to rise, if he so wishes, to confirm what I have just said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be if the Minister followed the hon. Gentleman, for the simple reason that the hon. Gentleman's point of order was not strictly a matter for the Chair. However, the Minister will have heard what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Throughout the 180 or so hours that we have spent in Committee, Opposition Front-Bench Members have consistently said that their opposition to the Bill is on the basis that, when Labour achieve power, reform of local government will become a matter for a Scottish assembly that they will set up. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] As Opposition Members confirm by their shouts, that is the premise on which they oppose the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Scotsman</i> quoted the view of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) on a Scottish assembly. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Asked yesterday whether he was including a Labour government in his comments, he said: 'Obviously, if there was a massive Labour majority, I don't think there would be any problem. But I am far from convinced that will be the case. If we do win the next general election, I think there will be a very tight majority for Labour.' "</p></blockquote>
Therefore, is it appropriate for the Labour party to continue its opposition on the basis that it is a matter for a Scottish assembly when one of its Members on the Committee does not wholly believe that there will be a Labour Government to implement proposals for a Scottish assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That response to an earlier point of order is a perfect example of the fact that when the Chair is kind-hearted it usually results in the Committee wasting a considerable amount of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Throughout our sittings Opposition Members have raised purely speculative press issues. Is it in order to refer consistently to erroneous press statements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1861</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise that complaint, but it is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 121</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>THE PRINCIPAL REPORTER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause goes to the heart of part III of the Bill and needs to be considered by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little doubt that part III should not be included: that view is virtually unanimous in Scotland. The people of Scotland were promised that there would be comprehensive legislation in this Session to deal with the welfare of children. There was widespread public expectation that that would occur, which was natural because England and Wales have had such comprehensive legislation on children for several years. Scotland has a major deficiency in that area and, as a consequence, Scotland's children suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply a desire to consolidate legislation that is behind the demand for such comprehensive legislation. A series of major inquiries have given rise to considerable public concern and there has also been a series of Law Commission reports, which the House should urgently consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee and the Scottish community know precisely why the Bill does not contain comprehensive legislation on children. It is because the Government have given priority to their own gerrymandering operations in local government. One issue has been taken completely out of context in a field of enormous importance to people in Scotland, purely because the Government wanted to find time to gerrymander Scottish local government for their own interest. Consequently, they have sidelined, pushed back urgent legislation for children, and that is unforgiveable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professionals who know legislation on children intimately and the many thousands of people throughout Scotland whose daily lives lead them to conclude that there are problems with the law, will not easily forgive the Government for putting unnecessary, Unwanted gerrymandered legislation on local government ahead of the clear necessity for legislation on children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government published last year a White Paper on Scotland's children which gave rise to the view that early legislation was being proposed. Much of the White Paper was acceptable and there was a reasonable degree of consensus on it, so there would not have been enormous political controversy. However, even after the consultation and a debate in Committee, we are faced with one crucial aspect of the way in which we deal with children in trouble being taken out of context and precisely the wrong remedy being produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks have the corroboration of the children's panel advisory group, an eminent group which brings together the elements involved in children's panels. The consultations about the provision have been all too hasty and the Bill contains the defects that have resulted from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1862</span>
The proposals in part III are opposed by the regional children's panels, which include people of all political opinions and of none, and by the children's panel advisory group, which consists of representatives from the 12 regional and islands children's panel advisory committees in Scotland and advises the Secretary of State on matters relating to the general administration of the panels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that the Government would pay close attention to the criticisms by such professional and expert groups. They pointed out, and I stress, that the proposals have the following disadvantages: they will lead to a loss of accountability; to the use of non-local reporters; to more remote centres for hearings; to an increased fragmentation of the service; and to an increased cost of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will also lead to a loss of the professionalism that the service has grown used to since its inception, a diminished independence for principal reporters and a greatly reduced influence for reporters on resources and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a formidable list of criticisms of the Government's proposals. By defeating the clause, the Committee could force the Government back to the drawing board to examine the proposals again in the wider context of what is necessary and vital to deal with the problems of children in our community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief, because we intend that the matter will be tabled again on Report. It is right that the Government's haste in legislating out of context should be given a wider audience so that the public understand what has happened. The Committee's debate should be seen as preliminary to the wider debate that will take place on Report and, undoubtedly, in the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a loss of accountability because at the moment reporters are answerable for general management policy and budgetary decisions to the local authorities. Given that a reporter is a locally based public official with significant powers and responsibility over a community's children and young people, such accountability is appropriate and necessary. That was the purpose of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1968 Act established the children's hearings system and that was based on the profound recommendations of the Kilbrandon report. It stated that the individual problems of young people in trouble were required to be examined in the context of their situation in their community and their families and dealt with by the organisation of suitable resources around the child and the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The context of local treatment of children and local accountability of the institutions established to deal with them was at the heart of the 1968 Act. On both sides of the Committee and of the political divide in Scotland there is widespread appreciation of the quality of what the children's hearing system in Scotland does. There is pride in the notion that, perhaps, we have got things right and other parts of the country have got them wrong. It would be an act of great folly to undermine, by rash and precipitate action, what has so painfully been built up. The establishment of a national reporter service will undoubtedly result in a severe loss of local accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, by definition a national system and a principal reporter answerable to a non-elected board will lose the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1863</span>
key attribute of local accountability. As an example of that loss, I point out to the Committee that the decision whether to pursue higher appeals to the Court of Session is at present taken by any reporter in a locality, subject only to the decision of the local authority, the members of which are themselves responsible to the community. The Scottish Office has already stated that in the context of the national system that is to be created,
	<br><blockquote><p>"choices would have to be made"</p></blockquote>
about the initiation of appeals within the very tight budgetary constraints on a national service. The decision will be taken, not locally, by local people, who are, subject to local accountability, but on a central, bureaucratic basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second criticism is that non-local reporters will be used. The basis of the present system is that people are chosen in their locality, operate there and are accountable to their local authorities. Centralisation would mean the prospect of the principal reporter perhaps moving reporters around Scotland to cover for factors such as illness and leave. That goes against the principle that was firmly established in the 1968 Act, that the reporter should be a person with local knowledge and with close working relationships with other agencies in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Critics of the measure believe that it will lead to the hearing centres becoming more remote. The central reporter might in some circumstances find it practical or reasonable to move the centres for hearings. That would also result in the loss of the local element that is crucial to the system, and in long distance travel for families and panel members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increased fragmentation is also to be feared. I quote the information supplied to the Committee by the children's panel advisory group. I hope that all hon. Members have absorbed it and learned from it. Its members are
	<br><blockquote><p>"greatly concerned that the proposals within the Bill may create a variety of structures which do not fit together well. Thus it is possible the Reporter's Service will be nationally co-ordinated; CPACs organised jointly, and Panels based on local Council areas."</p></blockquote>
The key part of the group's evidence is its statement that
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is likely to lead to a fragmented and uncoordinated service, where accountability is lost, and the children's best interests are not necessarily kept in clear focus."</p></blockquote>
That criticism is made by people who are profoundly involved in the system that is now in operation. The Minister would be well advised to listen to it carefully. If he finds it easy to dismiss such criticism, I question his judgment. The children's panel advisory group continued by stating;
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children's panels based on the proposed local government areas is not the best way forward. Past experience tells us that fragmentation of existing Panels will lead to a dilution of existing skills, experience and resources, poor consistency of approach, and difficulties over organising training."</p></blockquote>
That is another devastating criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been pointed out that establishing this centralised service will involve increased cost. The current cost of the reporter service is about £7 million. No one imagines that a centralised service could be operated more cheaply; it is likely that the cost will increase considerably. Dumfries and Galloway regional council—which is close to the constituencies of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang)—estimates
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1864</span>
that the cost of a national reporter service will be well in excess of that amount should current staffing levels be maintained, but it is likely to lead to an increase in those levels as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most serious criticisms—which comes back to the point of order that I raised at the beginning of the sitting—is the loss of professionalism that will result from this move taken, as it is, in isolation. We cannot separate the reform of the children's hearing system. The Government are to abolish the statutory requirement for local authorities to have a director of social work and for any such director appointed to have precise professional qualifications. This part of the Bill and the Government's whole thrust will lead to a diminution in professionalism, which is the best guarantee of the high standards that we have come to enjoy and which has made the children's hearing system something of which we can all be proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the new post of principal reporter will not have attached to it any conditions regarding qualifications. That fact, together with the way in which directors of social work have been treated by the Government, should make us genuinely worried about the level of professionalism proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister responds to the debate, perhaps he will tell us what qualifications he or the Secretary of State believe reporters should have. Will he tell us whether the post of principal reporter or reporter will be advertised and what conditions will be placed on those who want to be considered for the job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be done about training after this change takes place? The comprehensive training programmes that the regions have built up will be affected by the change from eight regions to 31 council areas. What will happen about the worthwhile and crucial training that reporters currently receive, and about the training for panel members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The diminished independence of the principal reporter is also a matter of concern. Although the Government have proclaimed the independence of the principal reporter, clause 128, if passed by the Committee, will allow the Secretary of State for Scotland to give the administration directions on the specific or general nature of its functions, and thereby to the principal reporter. What power will the principle reporter have to dismiss that advice, to give consideration to it or to change it? Will the Government give clear guarantees about the professional independence of the principal reporter? The Minister may care to explain why the principal reporter will be responsible to the Secretary of State and not to the Lord Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a host of reasons why the Committee should throw out the whole of part III of the Bill and why the Government should reconsider this proposal in the wider context of what is required and what is urgently necessary for Scotland's children. As good a reason as any for doing that is to be found in the Finlayson report published in 1992, entitled "Reporters to Children's Panels: Their Role, Function and Accountability".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that the Government can casually dismiss the authority of that report and others. The Finlayson report strongly recommended that the office of reporter should remain a local authority function and should not be transferred to a national body. So far, we have heard precious little justification from the Government for departing from that recommendation. The report stated:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1865</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The relationship between Reporters and Panel membership would be less close and it would be unrealistic to anticipate that a Central Government Reporter official would be in a position to influence the provision of essential local government support and services in the same way as he does and can do as a Local Government Chief Officer. Some of the advantages claimed by advocates for the change would be more illusory than real and the status quo in this regard is to be preferred."</p></blockquote>
Why have the Government chosen to ignore that pointed advice from an authoritative report? The Finlayson report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Transfer to Central Government control would affect the balance of the hearings system and a hearings system which incorporated a significant Central Government control would experience difficulty in relating to a local authority structure. The participatory role which the Reporter currently plays in the provision of local appropriate services for children would be seriously inhibited if he were a Central Government, as opposed to a local authority official."</p></blockquote>
That recommendation was made on the basis of sound, profound, professional authority. The Government have swept it aside as they try to juggle with elements of local government for no better reason than to advantage the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of this part of the Bill is wrong. It is wrong to consider it with measures with which it has little connection. It is wrong for the Government to ignore professional advice, especially that given directly to the Secretary of State. The Government are in grave danger of undermining an experiment in Scotland in which we all take pride. Part III of the Bill should be withdrawn. The Government should go back to the drawing board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. In the light of the powerful case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) would it be in order to move a procedural motion that part III be not considered? The Government could then reconsider the matter. The issues in part III would normally form a separate Bill. Is it possible to move that part III is not considered by the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman always tries to help the Chair. However, the answer is no. For elucidation, the hon. Gentleman can talk to our learned Clerk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Hamilton and appreciate the point of order. The Opposition are quite properly worried about the representations that we have all received. The representations express anxiety about fragmentation, cost increases and loss of professionalism. The hon. Member for Hamilton homed in on those key points. However, it is right for the Bill to cover issues of magnitude. As the hon. Member for Hamilton said, we are proud of the achievements of children's hearings. No system is perfect; human systems will always contain human error and failings. However, children's hearings have served Scotland well over the years, in our ever-changing, difficult world, an increasing number of children's problems come to the fore.

I agree that clause 121 is important. When my hon. Friend the Minister replies I should like him to tell us about the terms and conditions of the appointment of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1866</span>
principal reporter under subsection (2). I am not totally convinced that it is wrong for legislation of this magnitude and importance for Scotland to be structured in a way that could provide an all-Scottish basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it odd that Opposition Members argue two different cases. They constantly call for the establishment of a Scottish assembly with all that that entails, but will not tell us what powers and influence it will have, other than some vague reference to powers from Westminster and from local government. They never give us any detail.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is surely an area into which the Opposition's proposed assembly would want some input. If so, how can they avoid a structure such as the one that the Bill is attempting to set up? I ask that question because it is important that when we address the realities of what will happen if the Bill becomes law—and there is every prospect that it will—a structure will have been put in place by the Government that could make it easier for the Opposition to bring their planned assembly into being. I am not all that pleased about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves on from the realities of the situation in Scotland, has he, like me, received a letter from his local council in Perth and Kinross saying that part III of the Bill is wrong and should be deleted and that the children's panel service should be retained under local authority control? Does he agree with his local Conservative supporters in Perth and Kinross?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman think that I take an interest in these matters? I take comments from my local council very seriously. I discuss matters with them, which may come as a great surprise to the hon. Gentleman. It so happens that key people on the committees in Perth and Kinross are key officials in my own association. I recently had discussions with them. I therefore want my hon. Friend the Minister to tell us about the terms and conditions which, unsurprisingly, must have Treasury approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in our debates on social work and education directors, I am not opposed to statutory posts, provided that they are on renewable short-term contracts. I should be interested to know whether that practice can be followed here. If people are employed in a professional capacity it is important to be able, if necessary, to make changes without too much difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman properly decided not to support statutory directors of education and social work because he could not get a guarantee about fixed-term contracts for those posts. If he cannot get a guarantee about a fixed-term contract for the principal reporter will he similarly decide not to support the Government's proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman would listen carefully to what I say. If he reads what I said in earlier debates he will see that I made it quite clear where I stood on the matter. I expect my hon. Friend the Minister to listen to what I have to say. I am sure he will. Had the Committee listened to my proposals and thinking during the debate on statutory directors and had

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1867</span>
fixed-term contracts been part of the deal, I would have had no difficulty in supporting it, as I made clear at the time. I should like some idea of the terms and conditions, which I hope will be decided on the basis of a renewable fixed term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned a previous debate, but the point is relevant also to this debate. Is he saying that if an amendment were tabled proposing a statutory obligation to have a director of education and a director of social work, who would be appointed on fixed-term contracts, he would support our argument rather than the Government's?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman read the report of the debate, he would know that that is precisely what I said. I would have no difficulty supporting it. I happen to think that there is considerable merit in employing professional people. I said also that directors would probably be responsible for other services such as education, leisure, recreation, social work and housing. Those management structures are both sensible and logical. I would have no problem with that, no inhibition about supporting what, structurally, will provide Scotland with what we require to do the job effectively. I merely need explanations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, have read the COSLA amendments carefully. My hon. Friend the Minister should always beware of vested interests, wherever they are expressed. My worry is where we go when the Bill is enacted, and what will happen if there is a future change of Government. That concern has motivated my thoughts on most of the proposed structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland has a distinctive framework of child care law and a children's hearing system that lies at the hear of its arrangements. It has served well the country, and innumerable youngsters and their families. I must tell the Minister as a fellow Lothian Member of Parliament that I am dismayed at the idea of unpicking a service that serves our constituents so well. I say without bravado that, before the next general election, I shall go around South Queensferry, which the Minister represents, where I have many friends, and where my children went to school, telling people, regardless of party—many people other than Labour party members have expressed concern—that in making the proposals contained in the Bill, one of the candidates is responsible for wicked and wanton destruction. That is how I feel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will affect a settled balance of interrelating services, involving the lay community as panel members. They would bring their experience, commitment and training to the problems presented by families and youngsters in trouble and experiencing difficulties. The local authority's responsibility for social work, education and police policies, as well as the professional skills of staff, are deployed to assist families and children and to support, and give effect to, the hearing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the reporter is the fulcrum of the effectiveness of the entire system. His impartial role is of crucial significance because he is the guardian of the best interests of the children involved and he controls the best facets of the system and its arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals would remove the responsibilities of the office of reporter from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1868</span>
independence of its setting in the local authority. It is a piecemeal change that would unbalance the arrangements system and undermine the effectiveness and confidence needed in the working relationships between panel members and reporters, and other local authority staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the inquiry into events in Orkney and Fife, the Government published a White Paper, "Scotland's Children", which highlights the need for further review and changes in the framework of child care law. The proposals brought forward by the Government today ought to be framed in the context of a new Bill on child care law, and not brought before the Committee as an ill-thought-out, piecemeal amendment in this tawdry Bill on local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strength of the existing arrangements lies in the careful balance of the various elements and the commitment that all who are involved bring to the interests of the children, young people and families involved. The proposal to nationalise the reporter service—probably the first piece of nationalisation undertaken by this Government—will damage that effective balance. It will undermine the present lines of acountability that allow effective work in the most difficult cases, and a proper and appropriate involvement of the reporter and panel members in the overall development of services for vulnerable youngsters and their families. Placed alongside the licence that the Government proposes to give the new local authorities not to have education or social work committees or for those service areas to be required to be managed by a statutory officer with appropriate professional qualification and experience, the Government's proposals represent a step back to the 1930s rather than a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The children's hearing system in Scotland was introduced as part of the implementation of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, on which some of us worked extremely hard, and represented the most significant change in the juvenile justice arrangements for children and young people in Scotland this century. The crucial role of the reporter was established together with that of panel member. That brought together within a framework of welfare rather than punishment three lay people to determine, after listening to the views of professionals, the family and the child, what course of action was best suited to promote the welfare of a particular child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The separation of welfare from guilt and punishment has proved to be immensely successful in providing for Scotland a sensitive, compassionate and considered basis for determining how the needs of children and their families can best be met. The reporter is the key person at the heart of Scotland's system of juvenile justice. It is the reporter who carries the responsibility of determining whether or not a child should be referred to a panel to be considered for compulsory measures of care. In exercising that huge responsibility and discretion the reporter relies heavily on his or her close working relationships with the professional agencies that provide services within the community, the most important of which are the social work department, the education department and, frankly, the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reporter's influence is by necessity extensive, becoming involved in influencing and helping to develop corporate child care policies and strategies, and the policies of individual departments in tackling the huge
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1869</span>
problems that are generated by children in need and children in trouble. Because the reporter is a chief officer of the regional authority, he or she is able to exercise that influence through the close working relationships that exist within Scottish regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one knows better than the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas Hamilton), whom address in his capacity as I speak as a constituency Member, that the system works extremely well in our area. The development of youth strategies, child protection procedures and policies and services for children under eight and their families are just three examples of the sorts of policies that the reporter will influence because of the unique knowledge that he or she has from exercising his or her role as the reporter to the children's panel. The reporter, whilst retaining professional autonomy and independence, is additionally very influential in advising elected representatives of the statutory social work committee on various aspects of child care and juvenile justice. The close working relationships that exist currently in Scotland between regional reporters, their chief officer colleagues and the elected representatives of regional councils have been a powerful force for the good in securing the necessary political support and financial resources to develop those services that are required to meet the needs of children at crucial points in their lives. It is therefore no wonder that there is widespread concern and alarm throughout Scotland that implementing these proposals will, at a stroke, sever those important links and centralise the management and control of the reporter service from within the Scottish Office. No matter what reassurances are given, there can be little doubt that the changes, if implemented in their present form, will erode the considerable influence for the good that reporters have currently through their social work committees and through the various chief officers and corporate arrangements in the regional councils of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister some questions. First, what possible justification is there for dismantling the current successful arrangement and replacing them with a centrally based Scottish Office directed system? If Sir Russell Hillhouse wonders why I am so angry with him in this correspondence, there is part of the answer. Secondly, given that the Bill has removed the requirement for a statutory social work committee, a statutory education committee and the statutory posts of director of social work and director of education, will the Minister explain precisely who the reporter will work with in developing policies and services for some of Scotland's most vulnerable and damaged children? Thirdly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has also asked, how will the central post of principal reporter be appointed? Fourthly, who will appoint the five to eight persons on the board who, as I understand, will become the "managing authority"? Fifthly, how many board members will be elected representatives from local authorities? Sixthly, is the principal reporter to be a board member and, if so, how can that possibly be justified, because of the conflict of interest and loyalties that may arise? Seventhly, if the principal reporter is not to be responsible for operational and professional matters, to whom will local reporters
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1870</span>
be accountable for operational and professional matters? Eighthly, what committee within the new authority will be held accountable and responsible for the children's hearing system? Ninthly, is the principal reporter to be selected from the existing reporters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are ill thought out, and bear no relationship to the day-to-day operational activity of the reporter service and the children's panel system throughout Scotland. They show considerable ignorance of the importance of ensuring good working relationships and local accountability of the reporter, and they are yet a further illustration of the Government's intention to centralise. That is the very opposite of what they profess the Bill to be about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask certain questions that have been put by Strathclyde and by Brenda Reid, the chairman of the children's panel, to whom I have talked. First, with the possibility of reporters being engaged across local authority boundaries, how will the existing close relationships between reporter, panel and local authority be protected? How will reporters be available regionally to participate in the strategic planning of children's services, regionally and locally in responding to and resolving the issues that arise, and locally in participating through offering advice in individual case planning? That question is in addition to those asked by Strathclyde, the second of which is this: how will the national service link into and influence local authority decision-making on services and resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what access will local panel chairmen have to the principal reporter if they are unable to resolve concerns locally? Fourthly, will reporters be allocated specific budgets for the provision of local services? If so, what criteria will be used to assess that budget? Fifthly, will limited budgets restrict reporters' ability to initiate and defend appeals, or will they be exempt from financial constraints? Sixthly, with increasing occurrence of budget holding in the national health service, possible opted-out schools and contracted out-social work and education services, it is likely that reporters will be charged for reports. Will budgetary constraints restrict a hearing's ability to obtain the necessary reports? It would be a scandal if the ability to obtain reports was constrained by financial cheese paring in such delicate matters as children's futures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh Strathclyde question is, what qualifications will be required for the post of principal reporter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighthly, what about services to children? Most new authorities will have a relatively small population base. How will hearings throughout Scotland be guaranteed access to a full and uniform range of resources for children?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ninthly, how will the high levels of homelessness, lack of training and unemployment among young people leaving care be tackled when authorities are smaller and so have fewer resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 10; how will residential facilities be managed to ensure hearings' access to them when the home authority has no such resources within its control?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 11; will opted-out schools be required to make provision, including specialist services, for all children in their catchment area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1871</span>
Question 12; what guarantees will be given to safeguard vital, non-statutory services to children and those provided by the voluntary and private sectors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 13; how will the Government ensure that the proposals in "Scotland's Children" for a full and integrated approach to child care become a reality within the new structure? Accountability and responsibility must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 14; how can a national reporter's service be held accountable to Parliament, local authorities, panels, families and children?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 15; panel chairmen must be in a position to influence and challenge the policy and provision of resources by the local authority, as proposed by "Scotland's Children". Without committees, how will that be achieved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 16; who will be held accountable for professional decisions taken on vulnerable or disturbed children if there is no qualified director of social work? Every member of the Committee has discussed with a director of social work or a key senior officer the problems of a young constituent in trouble. What will happen in future? Who will be responsible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 17; some new authorities will not be able to construct viable children's panels. How will the Government overcome that problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 18; will the Government make a commitment to train panel members and set standards in that respect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 19; will authorities be required to provide adequate training for panel members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 20; how will the Government ensure that the independent voice of panel members is represented, especially when there will be a national focus on the reporter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that it is not possible to answer such questions within the constraints of this debate, but if that is so, what on earth is Parliament doing introducing the Bill in the first place? I have asked substantial, detailed, worked-over questions and it will not do to answer them with generalisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that because of lack of time, we cannot properly consider the matter at this stage of our proceedings. I hope, however, that the questions will be answered in a letter. If not, they must be answered on Report and when the Bill is discussed by our noble Friends in the other place. In any event, the questions must be answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the line taken by the hon. Member for Hamilton and for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). I agree with, and understand, the hon. Gentleman's passion and anger about this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must answer the question why this part of the Bill was not introduced as a free-standing Bill. Local government reform or reorganisation will have consequences and everyone interested objectively in the subject, from a professional or any other view, understands that there must be some finessing of the current system. However, there cannot be much doubt that the current system is successful in getting results and bears close examination in comparison with other systems elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1872</span>
there is a need to protect the way in which the process works currently. The onus is on the Government to explain their decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial decision is why the Government have brought forward these changes in the Bill and why they did not introduce them as free-standing legislation, which would have had higher quality scrutiny and greater opportunity for more and better consideration. The decision to include them in the Bill is totally unsatisfactory from every view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested also in why the Government have opted to fly in the face of the recommendations of the Finlayson report, which came down heavily against centralisation as an option and as a direction of change. The Minister owes the members of that committee, if not the rest of us, an explanation of why the Government have gone against those recommendations and have jettisoned with such casual ease that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous incarnation as a local solicitor, I appeared in front of a number of children's panels. My experience in the Borders and south-east Scotland was that because the children's panels were rooted in the local community, the panel members and the hearing system had an influence over parents, who are a crucial part of the entire operation. Parents and the current reporters are a part of the local community. The influence of local reporters on their neighbours is extremely valuable, but, if the Government are not careful, that could be sacrificed or prejudiced by these changes. The Government must pay close attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In south-east Scotland, the area that I know best, evidence persuaded me that the relationship between the reporters and the panel members, who are drawn from the local community, is a valuable connection. Again, in centralising the system, the Government could prejudice that if they are not careful. I want the Minister to say something about how he proposes to protect that relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, reporters will suffer a loss of status as a result of the changes. At present, they have the status of chief officer. That gives them the ability to exert authority which, in my experience, they use sparingly and effectively in getting things done and in getting the local authority system and the health board system to respond urgently and sensitively when the need arises. I regret the loss of that status which will result from the changes that we are considering this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made earlier about the loss of local accountability is a serious matter that should not be casually embraced as being of no account. The new system will have a centralised reporter system and the only accountability that I can detect is between the chief reporter and the non-elected board. That is inadequate and does not reassure me that the benefits and advantages of the current system will not be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system embraces the possibility of having foreign reporters introduced to localities of which they know nothing. In the Borders, that would be a tremendous mistake. There can be exceptional circumstances in which bringing in someone from outside may be beneficial. If such a decision were taken by a local panel and reporter, I would support them, but the full scale importation of people who know nothing of the social and community conditions into which they are straying to take decisions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1873</span>
that would have a great impact on young people's and families' lives would be regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Setting up a body as a non-governmental department is a serious mistake. The new structure will oversee Scottish juvenile justice and the system that administers it. To have a non-governmental department is crazy; it would be like having the Lord Advocate's department, the Scottish courts administration and the Procurator Fiscal as non-governmental departments. The idea is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The adult criminal justice system works adequately as part of the Lord Advocate's department, has a historic tradition and has gained everyone's respect as being independent of central Government. I cannot for the life of me see why that which is good enough for the adult system cannot be used for the system of children's panels hearings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should a non-departmental body be set up in isolation? The Committee of course knows that it could be heavily influenced by central Government because people will be directly responsible to the Secretary of State for their appointments and futures, as well as their finance. Setting up a non-governmental department would be a serious mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be more local authorities under the unitary System, and potential for fragmentation. An amendment is necessary to take account of that, but the Government's measures are an afterthought to an ill thought out Bill that is unwanted in Scotland. That is a retrograde step and the Government may regret it as the process that is being put into legislation pans out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will regret not having given the matter more thought and including it in a free standing, independent Bill which would have deserved and received higher quality scrutiny than has been given to these proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Linlithgow has returned to the Committee Room because I want to answer his questions in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall explain the justification for a new central reporter service. It will avoid the restrictions on facilities of small reporters' departments which were identified by Finlayson. It will make it easier to promote consistency of professional practice, identified as a key area by Finlayson, and to provide for a clear focus of leadership and management in a principal reporter who will be accountable to the board of the new administration for his management function. It will also retain the independence of decision making about individual referrals to the principal reporter who will delegate decision making to his local staff. It will make it easier to promote staff training and development and subsequently raise standards of professional practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) about the substantial service given by children's panels and reporters over the years. I pay tribute to that. I will answer his particular points as soon as he returns. I shall concentrate on the questions asked by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. He asked how,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1874</span>
with the possibility of reporters being engaged across local authority boundaries, existing working relationships would be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for the principal reporter to determine the disposition of staff, starting from their present location and assessing local demands and conditions. Reporter staff will be based locally, but there may be some cases where they will operate between more than one local authority area. Decisions on location will be based very much on the interests of children and their families. The principal reporter will regard as a major priority the maintenance of links with children's panels and with local authorities to progress the best interests of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how the national service will link into and influence local authority decision making on services and resources. Reporters will be expected to establish and promote the closest links with authorities in order to influence their thinking on policies and resources. Reporters will continue their close links with individual schools. We hope that consultative committees of the kind which already exist in some parts of Scotland will be adopted in the new areas. The reporter will continue to be a member of the child protection committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify who is to be on the consultative committees? How will they be chosen? What advantages do those committees have over the present system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the instance of the local authority it would be perfectly possible to establish such committees. I imagine that councillors would be on them. It would be very much within the discretion of the local authority. I would certainly encourage that as, I believe, would the hon. Gentleman. I agree with him that a very good service has been performed within the Lothian region—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Reducing local government to one tier—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall return to that point because it relates to the Finlayson report but I first want to deal with the hon. Gentleman's specific questions in sequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must not quote what I said and get it wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not misquoted the hon. Gentleman. He paid a tribute to the service within Lothian region and I acknowledged that that has been a substantial service. I believe that the hon. Gentleman's remarks were absolutely sincere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Panel chairmen will have access to the principal reporter, although in practice the working contracts will be primarily with the locally based reporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reporter administration will plan and control budget provision for the operation of the reporter service throughout Scotland and also for facilities used by children's hearings. Local services for children will be the responsibility of the local authority.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1875</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked about limited budgets. I just make the general point that at present local authorities are not exempt from financial constraints. The administration will require to work within the resources allocated to it. The principal reporter will be required to defend appeals—as at present—which are made against the decisions of hearings to the sheriff court or to the Court of Session. But he will—like the present regional and islands reporters—have to exercise discretion about initiating appeals to the Court of Session against decisions of sheriffs on points of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way? Clarification of an earlier point would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the hon. Gentleman's point but I first want to deal with the detailed questions that were asked by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, to which he has a right to answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be required by the Bill to furnish reports on children. Health boards, as public authorities, also have a part to play in the welfare of children, including the provision of reports where required. There should be no question of reporters being required to purchase reports that are part of the responsibility of public authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about qualifications. A suitable professional qualification will, as it is now for regional and Islands reporters, be required, together with experience and proven ability in administration. Knowledge of child care law and child development will also be required. The detailed qualifications and requirements remain to be worked out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister blandly reads from a piece of paper a statement that suitable qualifications will be required, but that the details have yet to be worked out. He is discussing part of a Bill that was presented to Parliament at the end of last year. It draws, apparently, on years of Government thinking that has led them to legislate on this matter now rather than waiting for the comprehensive measure that is to come. Why is the Minister telling us that he does not even know what qualifications will be required of the principal reporter? Surely that is crucial and central to the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will amplify my comments. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North made a helpful speech in this connection. The Secretary of State will, of course, be responsible for appointing all members of the administration, including the principal reporter. The Secretary of State sets out the terms of the appointment. He will make the first appointment and set the terms and conditions, with the consent of the Treasury. Subsequent appointments will be made by the administration, with the consent of the Secretary of State. The administration may determine terms and conditions, for which the Secretary of State's approval, and the consent of the Treasury will be required. My hon. Friend's comments will be borne in mind in that connection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the debate since 10.30. I am concerned about the genesis of this portion of the Bill, which is causing so much dissent among members of the Committee, the public, members of the children's panel and children's panel advisory committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great respect for Alan Finlayson. When I was a member of the Lothian children's panel advisory committee I was very much involved with his work and I do not think that he would have been involved then had it not been for some of my colleagues and me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister has said suggests to me—and I should like to know if I am right—that the entire system is designed to set up some kind of career promotion structure for reporters in Scotland and that everything else is subservient to that consideration. It appears that the desire to set up a career structure for reporters is driving the structuring of children's panels, and that local accountability and input is to be lost. Is that the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is not correct. I set out at the outset of my remarks the principal reasons for changing the system. Inevitably, in a move from two tiers of local government to one tier, changes will result. If we establish 30 systems of reporters under local authority control, some would not be viable. Reporters were consulted on that point. They sent representations to every member of the Committee and 84 per cent, support the Government's line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be patient. As to Finlayson, the decision on a central reporter service represents a change of circumstances, which was recognised as a possibility in his report. Our proposal is to promote his key themes of prescription of basic qualifications, establishment of qualifying training and promotion of consistency of practice and procedures through a code of practice. We believe that that will strengthen the service considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister let me ask one question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, let me finish. The Finlayson report recommended that reporters should continue in the employment of local authorities, but it indicated that very positive action was required to solve the problems of small reporter offices. Finlayson recognised that his recommendations would have to be reassessed in the light of decisions about local government reorganisation, which could result in an increase in smaller reporter offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I deduce from what the Minister says that if local government were not being reorganised, this disruption of the children's panel system would not be necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that the overall advantages of having one tier of local government are overwhelming. Not only will it be a viable system which is supported by the vast majority of reporters—84 per cent.—but we believe that it will result in more consistency than currently exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal next with the questions asked by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. Local authorities will continue to be responsible for providing the necessary range of resources for child care. They will provide and commission services as required. Besides their own provision, they may purchase certain child care services from other authorities or organisations. That already happens, with authorities purchasing residential care outwith their area. We propose to strengthen the duties on authorities to provide services for young people who have been in care, many of whom are at risk of homelessness. Local authorities may provide or commission residential care services from other authorities or voluntary organisations. That happens at present, with regular use of specialist facilities outwith an authority's area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about opted-out, self-governing schools. A board of management on a self-governing school will be responsible for providing suitable and efficient education for pupils attending the school, including the provision of specialist services. Authorities retain responsibility for some services, however, such as the provision of educational psychological services for their area. Those services must be made available to pupils in self-governing schools in the same way as they are available to pupils in schools managed by education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about guarantees and safeguards for non-statutory services. Under the general welfare duty which will carry over from the old authorities, their successors will have to assess carefully the need for continuity of services, however provided. Regarding the voluntary sector, we have given an undertaking to make a direction requiring the old authorities to pass to the new authorities full information about their grants to the voluntary sector to promote continuity. The new authorities will have the same statutory responsibilities as the old ones, and will no doubt want to continue using the valuable resources of the independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the White Paper, "Scotland's Children", in which we outlined proposals for a new system of strategic planning for child care. That would be an invaluable means of planning the future development of services during the period of reorganisation and beyond. Proposals for a new system are being worked out for consultation, and under those arrangements, all authorities will have to draw up child care plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reporter will have to exercise discretion over initiating appeals to the Court of Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1878</span>
At present, decisions on funding are taken by accountable local authorities. Who will be accountable, and to whom, when the new principal reporter decides that he cannot afford to initiate an appeal to protect a child?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks two different questions. As to appeals, if another body appeals against a reporter's decision, the reporter is required to contest that appeal. Whether the reporter should also appeal on a point of law is within his or her discretion. In that capacity, the reporter is, rightly, independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about accountability. Reporters across the country will be accountable to the principal reporter for their professional decision making. The responsibility for administering the system in the first instance will lie with the principal reporter, who in turn will be answerable to the board of reporter administration. As was mentioned earlier, that board is appointed by the Secretary of State. It is accountable to him for the effective management of the administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about panel chairmen. A variety of local consultative arrangements already exists. Following the Fife child care inquiry, COSLA encouraged constituent authorities to involve panel chairmen in the work of the relevant service committees. Useful links have been established in a number of areas. We would expect those to be developed with the new councils. As I mentioned earlier, we shall issue guidance under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 on staffing arrangements in the new authorities. That will include guidance on the need to ensure professional oversight of social work services at an appropriate level in the organisation, with professional decisions taken by the right kind of person at the right level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman touched on the children's panel structure. We believe that it is important to keep the essential community focus of local panels by basing them on individual authorities. It is unduly pessimistic to assume that some panels for new areas will not be viable. At present, the Islands authorities are fully able to construct panels. None of the new authorities will be as small. The new panels will provide a new and sharpened focus for the involvement of local people concerned about the care of children who have offended or who have been offended against. If any particular difficulties arise in recruiting in a local area, existing legislation offers a helpful flexibility about the residence of panel members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already answered the question about training. We have commissioned the preparation of a core curriculum for initial training of panel members which sets out standards of knowledge and competency. We shall maintain our major commitment to support and develop training for panel members. Furthermore, a new clause has been tabled to place a duty on local authorities with regard to training. We wish to look on that proposal sympathetically, and I shall say more about that when we reach that part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about the independent voice of panel members. Panel members will be represented through already existing national organisations. We value our contact with them and we envisage the continuation of the children's hearings representative group, which brings together all the relevant interests, including panel members.

If the hon. Member for Linlithgow reads the record, he will see that I have answered his questions, of which there were a considerable number this morning. I am grateful for his letting me know the sources of his anxiety, and allowing me to respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the principal reporter is the linchpin of the Government's proposals, but the Minister has said that the necessary qualifications remain to be worked out, as do the terms and conditions of employment. Will the Minister say how that information will be announced? With whom will consultation be held, and will Parliament be involved? What the Minister said implied wave after wave of consultation after the Bill becomes law. Why was that consultation not held before the Bill is enacted? The Minister seems to have rejected the consultation that was held, such as the Finlayson report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be consultation and guidance will be issued as I have described. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked why a specific Bill was not brought forward to cover part III. This Bill provides for the greater efficiency and accountability of local authorities and deals with a number of important public services in Scotland. It is entirely appropriate and desirable that Parliament should consider the reforms as a comprehensive whole, especially if given the various relationships and common factors among the public services dealt with in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister and noted that he agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow when he praised the reporter service in Lothian region. The Minister said that it had been a most successul service but then failed to explain why he proposed to abolish such a service and others that come under local authority control throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reminded of a programme that I heard at the weekend on national radio when Professor Ross Harper CBE, who is perhaps one of the most prominent Tories in Scotland, praised to the hilt the children's panel service in Scotland and, through that service, the Scottish reporter service. I have also read the letter from Perth and Kinross Tories who want the reporter service to remain under local authority control, despite the fact that their local Member, the hon. Member for Tayside, North, will vote for the exact opposite at the end of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Tories not prepared to listen to what everyone in Scotland tells them? It was summed up in one sentence in the Minister's speech, when he said that all this is happening as a consequence of the move to single-tier government. We are getting rid of an excellent service, which is the pride of Scotland and is envied thoughout Europe, simply because the Government want single-tier local councils, in the belief that Conservatives might win an odd council in Scotland as a result of that change. Service after service in local government—whether education, the social work service or concessionary travel schemes for the elderly—is being sacrificed at the altar of those people who run a handful of councils in Scotland and who are trying to achieve some legitimacy. It is a disgrace. Conservative Members who vote for the clause should be deeply ashamed of themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1880</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In conclusion perhaps I may quote an extract from a letter sent by the Strathclyde children's panel to the Secretary of State on 8 March 1994. The panel members are deeply committed to and heavily involved in the system; they are not politicians nor do they have a vested interest in local government reorganisation or in stopping it. They are, however, genuinely concerned about the effects of part III. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill proposes radical changes to local government, some of which, we believe will inevitably cause serious damage to Scotland's Juvenile Justice and childcare system."</p></blockquote>
That is a considered view from non-politicians, The Government are mad if they ignore such advice. In any event, they are politically mad to proceed with the Bill. They are endangering something that everyone in Scotland considers is a success, precious, and an achievement of which we are all proud. The Government should listen carefully to the voices of concern expressed in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that there is no alternative. They will turn Scottish local government upside down; they will move to so-called unitary authorities and will put 30 of them in place instead of the present eight regions and three Island authorities. By virtue of that fact alone, they argue that they must create a new centralised principal reporter system, as set out in part III. That is a bogus prospectus. There are other ways to proceed. The Government have found other ways to deal with the police and fire services, on a joint board basis, so there is no need for the centralised structure that the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us this morning that the panels will still be based on local communities and that the principal reporter will be independent. No one believes that because no one believes anything that the Government are saying. All experience suggests that what they promise will not happen. They are in love with centralisation and that is one principal reason why the Government are in trouble. At the weekend, Mr. Christopher Patten, Governor of Hong Kong, was reported as deliberating with enormous wisdom—from 5,000 miles away—on the Government's problems. He said that one is their obsession with centralism and he accepted some responsibility and blame for that. Surely, even at this late stage, the Minister can recognise that this Bill is part of the same syndrome. It damages the Government's reputation but, more significantly, it damages institutions that people in Scotland consider to be extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The half-baked nature of part III is shown by the Minister's admission that the Government have not determined the qualifications that will be required for the principal reporter, who will run the new, centralised system. We do not know whether the post will require minimum or maximum qualifications. We are told that the details will be worked out later, but we have reached the 160th hour of Committee proceedings. The Government knew that part III was to be discussed. They believe that it will be agreed, but they do not even know what qualifications will be required for those who are appointed under the Bill. That shows how useless they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

include knowledge of child care law and child development. Specific details will, however, be worked out after consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the Minister's reply is self-evident; the second part shows the extent to which the Government's thinking is half-baked and unprepared. Perhaps the Minister should have got a new piece of paper from which to read, because he was scrabbling around for the original piece. If he has no other, we must conclude that he has given us a definitive answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not got a clue. Scotland needs a comprehensive Bill that deals with children and child care. The provision in the Bill is hopelessly inadequate and it will have damaging effects because the issue has been taken out of context.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1882</span>
I have often driven people out of a room but never before I have opened my mouth. I would gladly drive out members of the Committee who have no interest in Scottish politics apart from voting to get back in favour with the Government Whips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment attempts to grant freedom of action to the principal reporter who may or may not be adequately qualified to do the job. We discovered in our previous debate that we do not know what qualifications the principal reporter needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We require a children Act, which a principal reporter could use to carry out his functions. On 28 January, I met Lord Fraser of Carmyllie—I find it hard to refer to him as an honourable Lord because I remember him as a humble politician who failed to hold his seat in Angus, East against the present hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh)—in his capacity as the appointed Scottish Office Minister in the Lords. Appointments seem to be a theme of this Government. That is why we do not have the responsible Minister in the Committee. Sadly, it falls on the shoulders of the Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Sir James Douglas-Hamilton). Normally, he is a reasonable person and he must be soundly embarrassed at having to read briefs that have no answers for the Committee and at knowing that he is destroying something that is very precious in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is proposing to destroy the children's panel system, which seeks out the best support and care of children involved in criminal misdemeanours. That is a fundamental part of dealing with such children. The responsibility for that has been borne well by the reporters up until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect English members of the Committee to have taken note of the crime statistics that were released at the weekend. But Scottish members of the Committee will have noticed that again, there has been a fall in crime figures in Scotland, despite massive poverty and pressure that people are facing. In Scotland, we do not experience rising crime among young people. We do not have children with 80 convictions who are released before they go to the juvenile courts in England and Wales to commit another 20 crimes. That is because the children's panel system is fundamental to our approach. It is well respected and many people are attempting to copy it, yet the Government are threatening to do it serious damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the same day that I met Lord Fraser, I met people from the Scottish Children Act group, which wants a children Act that would study carefully the Finlayson report and the principles of Kilbrandon and the modern context in which they work, even with this lunatic breaking up of local authorities in Scotland. It would produce something that was sensible. Legislation on children is forced into this Bill in such a way as to define tightly the role of the principal reporter when there is a need for greater flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that same day, the Scottish all-party group on children met. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and I attended the meeting and met people from the mediation service and others. I noted that people were there from Lord Fraser's department who listened to what was being said. They said that a children Act was necessary to accomplish their proposals, rather than having measures stuck into a local government Bill, which is threatening and damaging, and which would get lost in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1883</span>
such a comprehensive Bill among all the other great problems of abduction and adoption. An Act should cover this and other specific areas as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finlayson report was clear, but the Minister was very disingenuous when he replied. He cited extracts that left out entirely the specific reference in the report that strongly recommended that the office or reporter should remain a local authority function. Paragraph 22 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would be unrealistic to anticipate that a Central Government Reporter official would be in a position to influence the provision of essential local government support and services in the same way as he does and can do as a Local Government Chief Officer."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 9.34 also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The participatory role which the Reporter currently plays in the provision of local appropriate services for children would be seriously inhibited if he were a Central Government, as opposed to a local authority official."</p></blockquote>
The Minister attempted to divert the Committee from that conclusion because it is a fundamental one. It is important that the chief reporter has a broader function than the one defined under the part of the Bill that amendment No. 871 would remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill is passed and we think about the duties of the chief reporters, the relevant references to the Kilbrandon report should be studied because they see the children's panel and the reporter's duties as being tied up with local authority services. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the director of social education would have close to him or under his direct control a very large range of the services whose functions are such as to afford opportunities for the identification of children in need; full facilities for assessment; the necessary field organisation to undertake measures involving supervision (formal or otherwise) of children within the community; and the range of children's homes and residential schools provided by public authorities, as well as having access to similar homes and schools run by voluntary effort."</p></blockquote>
It is clearly stated that the responsibilities of the reporter are not just those described in the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, but are a fundamental part of caring social work services, not criminal justice services. That system has been a fundamental success in Scotland, but it is threatened by the limited, myopic logic of the Government, who have framed the measures that we want deleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We mentioned the resources of the specific officers, but there is a fundamental point about access to the physical resources that are required. It is noted in the submission of the Strathclyde children's panel, "Children Come First", and in the submissions of other authorities that problems are encountered if a reporter does not have access to residential resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee discussed social education and Labour Members told the Minister that the Bill was deficient because it did not make clear who would be entirely responsible for the provision of schools because there may be disaggregation. Disaggregation is simple: it means break-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities will be broken up into 30 or possibly more authorities while the chief reporter's responsibility will be drawn out from that to a local authority to central or centrist responsibility. I cannot find the correct word. One of the most fundamental dichotomies must be that the service providers will be subject to fragmentation while the person responsible, the chief reporter, will withdraw from local authority to central Government level. Such a dichotomy cannot be resolved by the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1884</span>
The position is the same as that of special education. Children who are at the moment provided with residential accommodation by an authority such as Strathclyde, under the children's principal reporter in the authority area, will find more and more that the residential accommodation is provided in another authority area. How will that be resolved? Nothing in the Bill allows for that resolution. The clause is written in a limited way and means that there is no flexibility, diversity or imagination allowed to the principal reporter to resolve the problem of residential resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The submission from Strathclyde also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 1968 Act only allows panels enforceable access to resources owned by their own local authority."</p></blockquote>
That is specifically what happens at the moment. Nothing in the Bill will resolve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told by hon. Friends who represent English and Welsh constituencies that Education Acts were amended to make it clear how special education should be dealt with, yet the Government did not accept an amendment about that from us. We need something from the Government on Report, if not now, to allow the flexibility for the principal reporter to resolve the problem about residential resources. Such flexibility is not available under the clause. The 1968 Act is not enough and in fact constrains the local authorities to provide in their areas. The problem will not be resolved and was not resolved for special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone is trying to puzzle out what is motivating the Government. The Minister did not answer the question when replying to the previous clause stand part debate. The function of the principal reporter has to be in some way consistent with the good practice achieved through the success of our current system. When we met Lord Fraser on 28 January to discuss the proposed children Act, he seemed to accept the breadth of the problems that we face and the need to solve them in a way that does not destroy the success of the system in Scotland for dealing with children who need care and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm

Without an extended definition of how the principal reporter will carry out his duties, other than just a reference to two Acts, the Government's thinking will not be explained. The Government will have to come back with regulations. That is worrying because we are not happy that changes can be made by regulation after the Bill has gone through. The matter has been badly thought out. As my hon. Friends have said, people from all political walks of life across the country have told the Government not to do it this way. It would be sensible for the Government not just to accept the amendment, but, after listening to the debate, withdraw part III and introduce a Children Act in which the subject can have its proper place and be treated with proper respect. I do not understand the Government's motivations. A career structure for the principal reporter is not an adequate explanation and the Government cannot expect us to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the important speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), by asking three succinct questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1885</span>
First, to which objectives and standards will the principal reporter be working? Who will set them? Will there be room for local emphasis to be given to his work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister said—I do not think that I distort his words—that locally based reporters will be expected to have contact with local panels and local authorities. What precisely will be the nature and focus of that contact? At present, the planning of children's services have benefited from information being provided to each region about referrals, decisions of reporters and hearings. Is it proposed as an example of so-called local government that the information will be collected and collated in the new councils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will elected representatives of the new councils be the sole persons appointed to the board of five or eight? If not, why not? If not, who will the five or eight be? Who will select them and what will be their relationship with the principal reporter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East suggested that youngsters south of the border can accrue as many as 80 charges, which creates a problem that does not exist in Scotland. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether it is true that, last year, in the constituency of Ayr 15 youngsters accrued in total between 750 and 800 charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his question. I require advice about the exact number, but that question bears out the great importance of the reporter service. Far from wishing to destroy the hearing system, which the hon. Member for Falkirk, East suggested, we want to strengthen it. We gave a major vote of confidence to it in the White Paper, "Scotland's Children". The changes should achieve two important developments: a higher standard of professional practice by reporters, with more consistency and more sharply focused local children's panels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administration to be established by clause 122 will have management and administration functions connected with the principal reporter and the offices appointed to assist him. Its general purpose is to make easier the principal reporter's performance of the functions conferred on him by the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. The purpose is described in the clause. It does not give the administration a role in the performance of the principal reporter's functions but we think it right that the Bill contain a definition of "purpose". Any provision for a new organisation that lacked such purpose and definition would rightly be suspect, and criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal reporter will have the same independence as currently enjoyed by reporters; he alone will be responsible for carrying out functions when making decisions about children referred to him. The question of standards will be a matter for the principal reporter. Certain duties are already specified in statute. I strongly favour collating information, and appointments will be on merit. The first round will be made by the Secretary of State; later appointments will be made by the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is setting those standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1886</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister realise that he is confirming my view that the idea came from a social work initiative—the Kilbrandon report? The Government are now ripping the reporter out of the social work system and out of the fundamental network that allows the reporter and the children's panel to function. They will no longer be part of social work departments, therefore they will no longer be criminal law officers at the Scottish Office. How can the Minister possibly claim to be safeguarding that symbiotic relationship between other social work support and resources, and the reporter, when he proposes to destroy it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will come under the aegis of the Secretary of State, not the Lord Advocate. Principal reporters are independent decision makers and will be responsible to the board, which is responsible to the Secretary of State for its administration. For that reason, the principal reporter will come under the Secretary of State's jurisdiction. It will be a national service with consistent standards and will, I believe, be extremely effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards standards, the principal reporter post will have a job specification set out in advertisement. He or she will have management standards set by the board and produce annual reports to account for their management of the service, but will be independent in decision making. I cannot say now who the person will be, but the Secretary of State will seek to appoint the best person for the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will have full flexibility with funding to provide directly all purchasing services. They will continue to assess local needs and determine how best services can be made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask yet again whether elected representatives of the new councils will be the sole persons appointed to boards of five or eight members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made it clear that they will not be the sole persons but that they will be eligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental difference of opinion among us. We believe that the best persons for the job should be appointed and that they should not be restricted to councillors, although councillors will, of course, be eligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of the Secretary of State's responsibility, will the Minister answer in simple terms? Is it not true that reporters will be taken away from social work departments and the present relationship with other social work chief officers, who are important in supporting the functions of reporters and children's panels, will be lost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. A national service will be operated centrally, but we expect the closest links to be established at local level for the efficient administration of the service. It will be the job of the chief reporter and the administration to ensure that that happens. I believe that that will happen because it is in everyone's interests that it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask one, succinct question. Clause 122(8) precludes the administration giving direction or guidance to the principal reporter. With the removal of statutory committees of local authorities to whom reporters now refer in the performance of their duties, how precisely will objectives and standards be established by the principal reporter? Will there be flexibility to allow local emphasis to be given to them? By what mechanisms will local consultation and involvement be achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned in my speech in the debate on amendment No. 871 that the English and Welsh education Acts had taken a step forward in terms of regulations to deal with the problem of children transferring from one authority to another. Such problems—access to resources such as residential schools and so on—must also be faced by the reporter service. The Education Act 1993 stated that regulations would be made. I have a copy of the regulations made in respect of special educational needs which tackle those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the operation of the chief reporter's responsibilities, we should look seriously at whether the locus of the chief reporter should be extended to deal with the problem and to ensure that there is not the guddle that I foresee in a national service when children require different kinds of residential care or other support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Government do everything by regulation because they never get a Bill right the first time, but I ask the Minister seriously to consider whether regulations are required to ensure that under the national reporter system children get the correct placement, wherever that placement may lie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am prepared to consider that point. Duties with regard to special
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1888</span>
educational needs will remain in place. I should make it clear that reporters are currently not responsible to authorities for their professional decisions; there will be no change in that under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not prevent existing links, liaison or communications from continuing. Nothing in the Bill removes any statutory functions from the reporter service. The clause establishes the Scottish children's reporter administration. The principal reporter will be the chief officer. The first appointment will be made by the Secretary of State and the administration will appoint future principal reporters and all officers. The administration will be responsible for the management of its officers. However, to ensure the independence of the principal reporter, it will not provide direction or guidance on the performance of the reporter's statutory functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm

I can tell the hon. Member for Linlithgow that the purpose of subsection (8) is to protect the independence of the children's reporters. The principal reporter will be accountable for standards to the Secretary of State and through him to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>New Clause 66—	<i>Reporters'Service—</i></p>
	<p>".—(1) Subject to the provisions of this section the functions of existing local authorities immediately before 1st April 1996 to provide suitable accommodation and facilities for children's hearings under Section 34 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and to appoint a reporter under Section 36 of the said Act shall be carried out on and after that date by the councils established in terms of part 1 of this Act.</p>

	<p>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sub-section, the membership of the joint boards established under this section shall consist wholly of councillors elected to the authorities established under part 1 of this Act within the areas of the joint boards.".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments and the new clause would provide greater accountability of the children's reporter administration. If the proposal goes ahead, it will be a very important body dealing with the future of children at risk in Scotland. Conservative Members often misrepresent the views of Opposition Members, so I shall say, lest there be any doubt, that we do not want these changes proposed in the Bill to go ahead: we would prefer the Bill to be withdrawn and abandoned by the Government. Even if they are not prepared to go that far, we ask them to withdraw part III, which—without diminishing the importance of the other changes—is the one that could cause great hardship to children at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that for some time I was a member of the Children's Panel Advisory Committee for Lothian and that I found that interesting and rewarding. My wife was for some time a member of the Strathclyde children's panel until she was elected to the council, so within the family we have had different experiences. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East, I commend the work of the children's panel system. It is worrying that the Government are pressing ahead with this unwanted, unnecessary reorganisation as a whole, but particularly as it affects that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have complained in other contexts about the different tiers of administration and organisation. The Bill is intended ostensibly to bring in a one tier system, but it does nothing of the sort as my hon. Friends and I have pointed out on a number of occasions. The same applies to dealing with offenders and children at risk. First there will be national reporter services and then we will have a national children's reporter administration. The police will then inevitably be heavily involved, and their responsibilities will be governed by the new police boards. The social work and education services will also be involved at the new local council level. Three administrative levels will be responsible for dealing with offenders and children at risk. That is quite ludicrous. Like other services that the Government propose to reorganise, the changes to the panel system will inevitably cause further chaos and confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1890</span>
We strongly oppose the proposed changes. We get into dilemma after dilemma, cleft stick after cleft stick on the Bill because we are opposed to it. We oppose the thrust and principle of it. If the Government insist on pressing ahead with it, we will make suggestions and put forward amendments and new clauses which will make its effects less harmful to the system of local government in Scotland. In amendment No. 881 we therefore suggest that if there is to be a reporters' administration to give it some accountability and some understanding of local people and how children get into difficulties and how best to deal with them, its members should be elected councillors, nominated by COSLA or whatever the successor local government body is called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest councillors, but who does the Minister suggest? Who does he think would be better equipped to be members of the administration? No doubt we will get the usual answer that we get on boards, joint boards and super-quangos: it will be businessmen. Even if they were appropriate, which I dispute because they do not have the knowledge and understanding of the conditions in which young people live and which, in many cases, drive them to crime nor are they accountable, they will be extremely busy. They already serve on the local enterprise companies, but it is also suggested that they should serve on the water and sewerage quangos. Those businessmen will be so busy on all those bodies that they will have no time to run their businessess, make profits and make enterprises successful. I hope that the Minister will not again suggest those overworked businessmen as eligible members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may suggest the appointment of experts, but as I said in the debate on water, experts should be the people working in the area. The professionals are those in the reporters' department, in the social work department and the education department. The board, or in this case the administration, is there to provide the accountability. There is no other reason for the board or administration other than to provide the umbrella of accountability and responsibility. The Minister said that himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once those five or eight responsible people are appointed by the Secretary of State—after, we hope, nomination by the local authority association—why cannot they choose their own chairman? I should prefer the title to be "convenor". Why cannot they choose the person who will conduct their business and also the vice-convenor or vice-chairman? Surely that would be sensible. Why must the Secretary of State always nominate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, the Minister said that the Secretary of State is remarkable—we understand why. That word can be used in many different ways. I agree with the Minister: the Secretary of State is remarkable. Clause after clause gives him more and more responsibility, because more and more nominations will be made and more and more people must be approved. Earlier, we heard that he must approve the arrangements for the appointment of the principal reporter. He will be extremely busy. Once those people are appointed, why not let them choose their own chairman and deputy chairman?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want openness and accountability. I hope that the Minister will accept all three amendments, especially amendment No. 881. There must be openness in the administration; it must be subject to the same arrangements and provisions as local authority bodies, as councils. That is necessary for accountability.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1891</span>
In a previous debate, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) told us that the Government are pressing ahead with the Bill because, "I am telling you", we do not want such an approach in this Committee. On this sensitive and important matter, we want the Minister to give rational arguments for the proposals. We do not want them, but if they are to be adopted, why cannot the members of the administration be accountable, elected councillors? Why cannot they choose their own officers? Why cannot there be openness?

The Bill removes the statutory requirement for a social work committee and a social work department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A social work director; I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The way things are going, however, there may well not be a social work department. I note that it was my hon. Friend and not the Minister who corrected me, which worries me a little!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been offered a children Bill, which so many people outside Committee pressed for from the Government—that Bill that would give us the time and opportunity to discuss in detail how to deal with children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are rampaging recklessly through the whole system of children's panels and hearings. That is not the way to deal with children who are at risk. As my hon. Friends have said, in the past we have said that the Scottish education system is the best in the world—sometimes not with the greatest justification. With the children's panel system—introduced by Kilbrandon and worked on by many dedicated people in the past 23 years—we have worked towards one of the best systems, perhaps not the best, to deal with children who are at risk and young people who have gone astray. It is a good system. It is unbelievable that the Government should recklessly and needlessly destroy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we cannot persuade the Government to withdraw the Bill or to withdraw part III, I hope that we can at least persuade them to accept the three amendments, which would make the legislation that little bit better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Perhaps I may draw your attention to the fact that the majority of clocks in this Room, which are on the Opposition side, are five minutes faster than the minority of clocks on the Government side. Given that the minority of Government representatives in Scotland are usually taken as the only people who count in this Committee, which clocks will count? Will it be the minority on the Government side or the majority on the Opposition side?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let the hon. Member be assured that the monitor over my shoulder will be the one that I shall use when calling an end to the proceedings at 1 pm. The hon. Member need not worry about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention of the amendments is clear—to make the new reporter administration directly in the image of a local authority, comprising elected members. That is quite different from the administration envisaged in the Bill and, had we taken that approach, the emergence of 30 new councils would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1892</span>
have meant an increase in the number of relatively small reporters' departments. It would be an uneasy and confusing half-way house solution to bring the service together, but put it under composite local authority control. That would confuse the accountability of reporters for the use and management of resources for the reporter service. It would unduly restrict the administration from benefiting from the services of a wide selection of people with a range of experience relevant to children and their care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that we are interested in appointing only business men. I shall certainly not exclude business men, but councillors, ex-councillors, ex-panel members, people with experience in voluntary organisations and those from academic backgrounds can also be appointed. We shall be appointing the best people for the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 66 would continue the reporter service in local authorities, but with provision for local authorities to create joint boards to administer it. We regard it as not nearly sufficient to ensure the high standards of efficiency and effectiveness in the reporter service which children and their families have the right to expect. In our view, these can best be attained centrally through the new reporter administration. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that reply astonishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is hardly surprising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not mention amendment No. 882 about the appointment of the chairman and deputy chairman, nor did he refer to the question of whether the meeting should be held in public. He has given an entirely inadequate response. That is not surprising, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, given the Minister's reputation when it comes to replying to debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister responded about the membership of the administration. Indeed, he has given the Committee and the public some very useful information. I am the last person to say that people in voluntary organisations do not provide relevant expertise. I was for a long time director of Age Concern Scotland and, prior to that, director of Enterprise Youth. No doubt the people working in those organisations are the kind of people whom the Minister means, especially those working in the youth sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to those in the academic world. They would provide a great deal of advice. We are talking about spending a great deal of public money. With the best will in the world, there must be public accountability. In addition, it is vital that those working in the service understand people's needs, especially people from deprived areas. With respect to academics, some of whom I know well, they are not necessarily the best people for the job.

I hope that the Minister will reconsider our proposal about the appointment of a chairman and vice-chairman. Even if his proposal on the membership is accepted, surely academics and directors of voluntary organisations

can choose their own chairman and vice-chairman. That choice should not be left to the paternalism of the Secretary of State. Even under the proposed structure of the administration, surely the meetings can be held in public so that there is some awareness of what is happening. I hope that the Minister will try again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Twelfth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has acknowledged that the proposed national reporter administration stems from the proposal to establish a large number of small, single-tier local authorities. If the measure has to be passed, has the Minister considered the delivery of the reporter service on a joint local authority basis, consistent with the proposal for the police and fire services? Some experts believe that that would resolve the problem of the four smaller authorities—the three islands and Borders, which would fall to the northern constabulary. It would also help the Lothian and Borders situation. such an arrangement would help to avoid disrupting the service to children. That is important. The majority of reporters would continue to work, as they do now, with groups of panel members, thus providing the best possible continuity of service. That is important as we must consider the relationship between the child, parents, panel members and reporters in the evolving process of regularly reviewing crucial supervision requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be continuity in the islands. The recommendations of the reports will be a matter for Parliament in due course. They will have to be tackled by a different Bill. The schedule makes suitable provision on status, constitution and proceedings. It stipulates that the administration will be a corporate body that will regulate its own affairs. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the appointees shall have no financial or other interest that is likely to prejudice their performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the question about public meetings, the administration will regulate its own procedures. It may decide to open meetings to the public. An annual report will be presented to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have seen from every reply, or non-reply, the schedule is a singularly ill thought
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1894</span>
out provision in a badly drafted Bill. I apologise for that last remark: the Bill is well-drafted in the context of what Ministers gave civil servants. However, the Bill is defective in the way in which it applies to the people of Scotland. The crucial, non-partisan issue that we are discussing should never have been included in the Bill. We should vote against schedule 12. However, there is no reason to detain the Committee on most of the clauses that follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We received no information or movement from the Minister on the schedule. We shall raise the matter again on Report so that people are aware of the damage that the Government risk doing to children in Scotland. Perhaps, when the Bill goes to another place, members of the House of Lords—even Conservative members—will prove less malleable and quiescent than the putative rebels on the Conservative Benches. I do not believe that their lordships will accept assurances such as we have heard in Commitee and wander into the Division Lobbies as Members of this House do. I recommend that the Committee vote against schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems an innocent enough proposal that there should be an appeal to the Secretary of State. But, at present, at least there is some chance of an appeal being considered against the wishes of the Goverment. If an appeal is made to the Secretary of State, what will that mean? The Secretary of State, as a politician, will obviously have little to do with it. Does it mean that there will be an appeal to Mr. Sinclair or whoever occupies his job at the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some knowledge of this because in the previous Parliament I had to deal with appeals from police officers against their dismissal. If a chief constable wished to dismiss a police officer, he

could appeal to the Secretary of State. I assure the hon. Member for Linlithgow that the Secretary of State gave specific and careful consideration to each case and, in a number of instances, the chief constable's decision was overturned. The same will apply in this case. Advice will be considered fairly. The advice of the Solicitor's Office at the Scottish Office will be brought to bear and both the junior Minister and the Secretary of State will give the matter the utmost consideration because a person's future will be at stake. That, inevitably, is a matter that a Minister must regard extremely seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause enables the principal reporter to delegate any functions to other officers of the administration, except making reports under clause 124.

The amendment would make it clear that the children's panel was sited in each local authority area. The Bill does not do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We envisage the present arrangements continuing wherever possible. It is important that children and their families be allowed to continue attending centres nearest to where they live, which may not always be in their own council area. In some areas of the smaller proposed authorities, there may not currently be a reporter's office or centre in a proposed neighbouring council area that is readily accessible and convenient. We do not wish to lay down undue restrictions but would like there to be continuity as a matter of common sense.
