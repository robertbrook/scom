Scottish Estimates<br><br> Health Services, Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered class XIV, votes 13 and 14.</p></blockquote>
May I extend a welcome to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) who I think is on the Opposition Front Bench for the first time? I understand, Mr. Martin, that he will seek to catch your eye in order to wind up the debate on behalf of the Opposition.<br><br>
The estimates before us today represent above all the Government's continuing commitment to the national health service in Scotland. They reflect the Conservative party's clear manifesto commitment that health expenditure would rise year on year in real terms. The figures will be well known to all members of the Committee. This year, spending on health in Scotland will be almost £4.2 billion. That is an increase in money terms of 5.3 per cent. on last year, and of 1.3 per cent. after movements in pay and prices have been taken into account.<br><br>
Since the Government came into office, spending on the NHS has increased in real terms by 50 per cent. What matters, of course, is not the total level of expenditure but the services that the level of expenditure produces for patients in the health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe (Glasgow, Maryhill)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister like to tell the Committee what is the percentage increase in pay for managers and administrators in the health service since 1980?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Lady the exact percentage increase in the proportion of total expenditure that has been spent on management—it is 0.65 per cent. That reflects two factors: first, a reclassification of, for example, senior nursing staff and, secondly, the fact that—rightly—there is an emphasis on effective management of the massive resources within the NHS in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will, but after that I should make some progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister remember the reply that he gave me in relation to Ayrshire, where, since his reforms have been introduced, the number of bureaucrats has doubled without justification. They are getting secretaries, cars and additional perks as well, while the number of nurses has been reduced by 300. So front-line care is being sacrificed in favour of bureaucrats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that analysis. I have given the figure for the total increase in management costs—0.65 per cent.—and the reasons for it. In relation to the hon. Gentleman's point about nurses, I specifically pointed out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
that part of the apparent increase in management is due to the reclassification of, for example, senior nursing officers in respect of their management duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that part of the problem is that Opposition Members tend to use the old definition of administration and fail to accept the fact that, for example, in order to release junior doctors for more medical time and shorter hours, clerical support is now given for things such as filing, which used to be carried out by junior doctors. That is why some so-called administration figures have increased. It has released time for more front-line medical support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The same applies to other public services, notably the police. There is a consistent and correct move by police authorities to release officers for more front-line duties by reducing the time that they have to spend on paperwork. That is the policy of Strathclyde police force.<br><br>
Before the interventions I was making the key point that there has been a real increase in resources of 50 per cent. since 1979, but that the improvement in services to patients is what really matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have already given way three times and I have only reached the second paragraph of my speech. Let me make progress and I shall give way later.<br><br>
The national health service is now able to treat a record number of patients. We have reduced the time that people wait for their first out-patient appointment and for admission for treatment. We can meet the waiting-time guarantees in all but a handful of cases. We are able to provide more information and more choice to patients and to develop new services in hospitals and in the community.<br><br>
Those achievements stem not only from the resources provided by the taxpayer but reflect the Government's efforts, working, I must emphasise, with health service staff to set out a clear strategy—a route map—for charting how we want to improve services. We want to ensure that the health service in Scotland is equipped in terms of its structure and staff to deliver services that are appropriate not just for today or for the 1990s, but for the next century.<br><br>
Several Hon. Members <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to make a little more progress and then give way, first to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).<br><br>
Let me finish my point about the national health service in this decade and in the next century. The health service cannot afford to stand still. It constantly faces new challenges as a result of demographic pressures, advances in medical technology and the public's rising expectations. The public are right to have such expectations. From reading some articles in the press, we sometimes get the impression that in defending the principle of the national health service in which everyone believes some people want to freeze the development of the service. That cannot be right. It cannot be right to provide services for the 21st century in ways and in buildings that date from the 19th or early 20th centuries.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the national health service faces new challenges as we approach the 21st century and, of course, he is right. One of those challenges is the new drug, Dnase, which has been under clinical trial at Ninewells hospital for the treatment of cystic fibrosis which, as the Minister knows, is a potentially fatal disease. There are concerns about the cost of the drug. It is estimated to cost £20 per patient per day. For that reason, people are afraid that the Government may rule out central support for making the drug available to those in Scotland who suffer from cystic fibrosis. Will the Minister give us a guarantee this morning that cost considerations will not come into his final judgment on the future of Dnase? More importantly, will he give a positive response to the request made to him recently for a further clinical test of this new, important drug at Ninewells hospital in the near future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give a positive reply to the hon. Gentleman's first question. I assure him that the use of the drug Dnase will reflect clinical decisions. I take into account his second point about further tests and, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall examine in detail the exact position and write to him about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that Opposition Members want to freeze the health service—a matter to which no Opposition Member has referred. In the context of the development of the health service, is it still the intention of the Scottish Office Home and Health Department to have a target reduction of 30 per cent. of acute beds in Scotland by the year 2005? Given the mortality and morbidity rates in Scotland and the high bed occupancy rate, such a reduction is unacceptable. What is the Minister's view of the target reduction of 30 per cent.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have reread what I said and noted that I was careful not to criticise Opposition Members on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It sounded like it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, it may have done, but I have reread what I said and I did not criticise Opposition Members, many of whom have an interest in die national health service. On the hon. Lady's second point, the target does stand. I hope to say something about that either now or later in the debate. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), after which time I wish to make further progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was talking about the need to modernise the health service. Worry has been expressed in the north-east of Scotland that the Grampian health care trust, which has only been in existence for a year, seems to be more intent on selling hospitals than developing new ones. Within the next few months, no fewer than four hospitals will be up for sale. A march took place down Union Street of hundreds of people on behalf of Woodlands hospital protesting against its closure. People will not be moved into new hospitals. For example, when Kingseat hospital, which was built in 1910, closes, people will be moved into wards in Cornhill that were scheduled for demolition and which are 1 SO years old. What sort of progress is that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured by mutterings of "rubbish" from my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch). My knowledge of the matter does
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
not suggest that the analysis of the hon. Member for Gordon is correct. The object of the health care trust proposals is to improve health care in the area. My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside wishes to refer to that later in the debate.<br><br>
I cannot over-emphasise the significance of the changes that are occurring in the delivery of health care, not just in Scotland but throughout the world. Each week we hear stories of miracle advances. We hear about new means of treating conditions that were previously unbeatable and about more effective treatment that reduces dramatically the time that people spend in hospital. We have new techniques by which patients can be treated as out-patients or treated by their general practitioners without having to enter hospitals at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must make progress. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman later.<br><br>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), the number of beds in acute care hospitals is no longer a sensible measure of the ability of the service to treat patients. What matters is, first, how long people must wait for treatment and, secondly, how good the clinical care is. That is why the hospitals of the future will be smaller than they are at present. They must be if resources are to be used properly. That is why the Government emphasise and guarantee shorter waiting times and why they are enabling GPs to treat patients without having to send them to hospital unnecessarily. That is why we are working with professional staff to improve clinical care and to find ways of measuring that improvement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way to the hon. Lady.<br><br>
We are finding ways of measuring that improvement through clinical audit and measurement of outcome. That is why we have devoted considerable effort in recent years to changing the structure and working of the health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his letter on foetal ovarian tissue. Will the Minister assure us that the Scottish Office will put nothing in tablets of stone about advanced treatment until the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has reported, which it is expected to do in July or August?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, and I give him the assurance he seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Caravan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister referred to the importance of providing locally based services rather than having patients travel a long distance for treatment. Will the Minister ask Iris Isbister, the Tory party placeperson who is chairperson of the Forth Valley health board, why—despite demands to the health board—there is still no locally based in-patient dermatology service for patients in the health board area? Why is the Forth Valley health board the only one in Scotland that does not have a locally based paediatric occupational therapy service? It is time that the Government told Mrs. Isbister to provide those essential services for people in the area, especially the children.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reject the hon. Gentleman's totally unwarranted personal criticisms of the chairman of the Forth Valley health board. The board provides an excellent service to its patients and to the families and communities in its area.<br><br>
I shall, of course, examine in detail the hon. Gentleman's other points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on a general issue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way to the hon. Lady, and I have given way about 10 times so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since, like me, the hon. Gentleman often wears the tie of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, I shall give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there was scope for more procedures to be carried out by general practitioners. He must be aware that, in many parts of Scotland, a substantial extra work load is falling on the shoulders of GPs. What will the Government do to increase resources to help GPs with that extra work load, following the closure of units such as the casualty unit at Haddington in East Lothian?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point. We have been examining the emergency cover work load of GPs and their being called out between 10 pm and 8 am. One way to remedy any problems is to increase the cooperation between GP practices so that patients receive cover but the burden on individual GPs is reduced.<br><br>
Changes that we are pursuing in acute hospital services in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Lanarkshire and elsewhere will mean that in the next century, we shall have some of the most modern hospitals in Britain, if not in Europe. Standards of equipment will be high and constantly improving. Work on clinical care will lead to some of the highest standards in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must make progress.<br><br>
All the improvements mean change, for example, different patterns of services with which to fulfil new and existing needs more effectively. Patterns of expenditure will need to be different if services are to remain effective and to improve. Our objective is to make Scotland's health services the best.<br><br>
Change is not confined to the acute sector. We are working hard to develop services in the community by GPs, community nurses and health visitors. We aim to provide services that are close to patients, and within their local community, wherever that is safe and cost effective.<br><br>
For that reason, health boards, in consultation with staff who work in primary care, are developing primary care strategies to ensure that the shift of resources and work load to that sector happen simultaneously. We have set up a primary care development fund to encourage innovation. This year, £3.5 million has been allocated to the fund to support pilot projects, led by primary care professionals for the benefit of patients. More than 300 applications have been received.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
On GP fundholding, there are just over 100 fundholding practices in Scotland. They have taken advantage of their freedom to provide more services within their practices and to accelerate the development of new, improved hospital services. Fundholders point to better physiotherapy and radiology services, quicker laboratory test results, and consultant clinics held in a GP's surgery. The pressure that fundholders exert benefits all their patients who are referred to hospital. We provide assistance and encouragement to GPs across Scotland to take advantage of such opportunities. We are investigating ways in which fundholding can be made more flexible, and smaller practices can become involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must get on.<br><br>
Changes are occurring in the long-stay sector. We are determined that continuing care should be tailored to the needs of individuals, and, where possible, provided in the community. The national health service has a continuing responsibility for those who require specialist medical and nursing provision. Others will receive support that is tailored to their specific needs, and is organised and provided by local authorities and others in the community. We back that policy with additional money, for example, bridging finance of £60 million to date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham (Renfrew, West and Iverclyde)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must get on. I have been on my feet for 22 minutes. Most of that time has been spent in giving way to Opposition members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Look at his tie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his tie.<br><br>
Another key element that has far-reaching implications is the patients charter. The charter has acted as a spur to bring about a concerted effort to ensure that the people of Scotland receive services that respond to their needs. The results are clear. Every year, more patients are treated as out-patients—the figure for last year was 6 million. That is 17 per cent. more than in 1979. Every year, more patients are treated and discharged as in-patients. The figure for last year was 950,000–30 per cent. up on 1979. More patients benefit from clinical and technological advances every year. They are able to be treated as day cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As hon. Members can see, my tie says, "Save the World". The Minister mentioned facts and figures for last year. Yet my constituents have to wait for considerable periods before they see a specialist in the Royal Alexandra Hospital. In one case, it was six months before my constituent saw a urology specialist. When it takes 20 weeks before someone can see a urologist and before medical care can begin, surely that is an indictment of the current approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Gentleman's general point, the waiting lists are not getting longer. Fewer people are on in-patient waiting lists than in the past; that is unquestionably the general position.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
There has been a very high demand for urology treatment at the Royal Alexandra—much higher than was forecast. I understand that particular measures are being taken to reduce the waiting list for, among others, the hon. Gentleman's constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I must proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to buy a new tie simply so that the Minister will give way to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke) is unsuccessful in catching your eye in the debate, Mr. Martin, I promise to give way to him when I wind up, if not before, even if he has not bought a new tie by then.<br><br>
Half of all patients are admitted immediately: three out of four within a month and 99 out of every 100 within 12 months. Of course, we are pressing for further improvements; there is further to go. The action that we have taken to reduce waiting times has been a god-send to many. In answer to Opposition Members, I accept that there is further to go and we are working on it.<br><br>
A key factor in delivering benefits to patients has been the establishment of NHS trusts—[<i>Interruption.]</i> I must tell the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) that those who are willing to reach a judgment on evidence rather than on prejudice increasingly acknowledge the practical benefits that the trusts have brought. New consultant posts are being created, allowing trusts to expand services. Facilities have been improved or extended. Clinics have been rescheduled to suit patients' requirements. Simultaneously, trusts are treating more patients more quickly than ever before. I repeat that: trusts are treating more patients more quickly than ever before. All those changes strengthen the capacity of the NHS to treat those who are ill.<br><br>
The Government are equally committed to the promotion of good health, to the prevention of sickness and disease. That is why we published major policy statements in 1991 and 1992, outlining a framework for a series of initiatives to make progress towards targets that we set for improvements in areas such as coronary heart disease and cancer where Scotland's health is especially poor.<br><br>
The health of the nation is not simply a matter for the NHS. It is, in substantial measure, a matter of people in Scotland pursuing healthy lifestyles. Some obvious factors come to mind—for example, smoking, diet, alcohol misuse and exercise. A wide range of initiatives is under way, following the report on the Scottish diet and the campaigns of the Health Education Board for Scotland and others.<br><br>
All the changes are occurring within the framework of the NHS; its purpose and values are unchanged. To reinforce them, my noble and learned Friend the Minister of State recently issued to all NHS boards codes of conduct and accountability underlining three key public sector values—accountability, probity and openness. The codes will enhance the effectiveness of the NHS boards. They will make them more responsive and accountable. They will ensure that the highest standards of conduct remain at the heart of the service.<br><br>

The national health service in Scotland has a clear agenda. It has a wealth of skill and commitment among its board members and staff. Effective systems are now in place through which its goals can be delivered. Through the money provided by the Government and in many other ways, we have demonstrated our total commitment to the national health service. For this Government, that is not just words but money and action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Robert Hughes. I apologise—I call Mrs. Maria Fyfe.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Leith to the Front Bench.<br><br>
If the wearing of a tie—especially a tie that wins the Minister's approval—is to be the qualification for being invited to speak, I had better advise my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) when she arrives today that the first thing she should do is buy a tie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is why the Chairman missed the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I suspect, too.<br><br>
Hon. Members will have noticed that the Minister could not utter his peroration without bursting out laughing. He was incapable of making those claims with a straight face on the record and on camera. If anything illustrates the Government's attitude to the health of the nation, it is their policy on prescription charges. A prescription now costs £4.75; I remind the Minister that in 1979 it cost 20p.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee what percentage of the population pays prescription charges? Will she confirm that it is only one in five, and that there are numerous exemptions for those who cannot afford to pay—old age pensioners, students, those who are critically ill and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are numerous exemptions, but there are also people who should have exemptions and do not get them. Prescription costs have risen by no less then 2.27S per cent. since 1979. That is an inflationary rise of spectacular proportions. If the charges had been kept in line with inflation, that percentage would be only 150, and the cost of each item would be only 50p—a much more affordable sum for ordinary families to pay.<br><br>
The national health service is changing dramatically. There are now 35 per cent. more administrators than in 1980. Only some of them—the number has not been revealed in answers to parliamentary questions—are senior nursing staff who have chosen that grade. There are far more people running the health service as a market than running it as a caring service. There are 50 per cent. fewer porters and cleaners and 30 per cent. fewer nurses in training.<br><br>
The waiting lists have been hailed as a triumph, yet day surgery is promoted to save costs, and doctors and nurses worry about their patients not receiving the in-patient care that they need. To bump up the numbers dealt with as inpatients and to reduce the waiting lists, patients are hustled out of hospital before they are fit to go home. Matters have reached the point where the <i>Sunday Mail</i> doctor last weekend urged his readers not to be pressured into going
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0103">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
home too soon and putting too much strain on their health. If a doctor has to do that, what state is our health service in?<br><br>
The Minister did not give details of the waiting list figures. I have the figures for 1993, which are the most up-to-date figures available. It is claimed that the number of in-patients listed has dropped to 57,299, but that ignores—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, let me continue this point. That ignores the 3,484 people on the repeat waiting list and the 11,265 on the deferred waiting list. The waiting list for day cases is claimed to number 27,000, but that does not take into account the 7,000 on the repeat waiting list and the 4,000 on the deferred waiting list. The in-patient waiting list of about 72,000 added to the 38,000 day cases equals a grand total of about 110,204. That figure is 23 per cent. more than the total previously claimed by the Government. They are ignoring patients on deferred waiting lists and those on repeat waiting lists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised that the hon. Lady quoted the figures for 1993, suggesting that 1994 waiting list figures were not available. I have the 1994 figures for our local hospital—they show a remarkable improvement in the figures between 1993 and 1994.1 suggest that the hon. Lady avails herself of the opportunity to compare the 1994 figures with those of 1993—she will find them interesting reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this is still 1994—it has not yet been completed. Therefore, I shall talk about the 1994 figures when we come to the end of 1994.<br><br>
In 1981, there were 60,000 beds and by 1993 there were only 47,000—a 21 per cent. loss. If the plans of the Secretary of State for Health go ahead, there will be hardly any beds. She will have more day cases and more patients sent home too soon to recover as well as they might.<br><br>
Sadly, the issue of maternity units is very much in the news. The Minister will be aware of the sad case of Karen Humphries, whose baby was snatched from a Nottingham hospital. Will the Minister take action or does he agree with the complacent attitude of the junior Minister in the Department of Health. There is no need for me to elaborate on the suffering that must be endured by Mr. and Mrs. Humphries, and I do not intend to. Baby-snatching is a rare event, but all parents and parents-to-be have to be confident that their infant will be safe and secure in a maternity unit. Will the Minister consider the issue of tagging? Will he consider staffing levels in maternity units? In many of our hospitals there is an increasing number of agency nurses working on part-time and temporary contracts. That must add to the problem of security. When all the staff are permanent and well-known faces, there is less danger of strangers presenting themselves as bona fide members of staff. What plans does the Minister have? Will he discuss the issue as a priority with the midwives and doctors in the maternity units? If he wishes to give me an answer in an intervention now, I should be glad to sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not intending to intervene but to reply to the hon. Lady when I wind up. However, I am happy to take the opportunity to agree with her entirely that the incident was of course distressing and that, naturally, it attracted publicity. Security in hospitals is planned locally,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
but we occasionally issue guidance. We shall consider the Nottingham case to establish whether guidance should be updated.<br><br>
As the hon. Lady will know, the Simpson memorial maternity pavilion of the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh has just begun testing an electronic tagging system. An alarm is sounded if the baby is removed from the premises. We shall seek a report on the outcome of the trial with a view to issuing, as good practice, guidance throughout the service in Scotland. Against that background, however, hospitals must be accessible to the public although older hospitals are often on isolated sites. I entirely accept the seriousness of the issue raised by the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his answer. Although I am glad that he intends to issue a good practice note, will he go further and devote extra funds to provide that security if it should prove necessary? That would reassure all parents that steps will be taken.<br><br>
Other aspects of the health service deserve criticism. Health Care International at Clydebank was built with the promise of 4,000 jobs and assurances that it was intended for the overseas market, despite evidence from existing private hospitals in England that they were half empty and could not get enough patients from that market. Claims were made that the World Health Organisation supported the project but it instantly denied that. It stated that its policy was to encourage the building of hospitals in less developed countries and for them to create their own health services and not have to send patients abroad.<br><br>
In spite of that, the hospital went ahead and its management refuses to give any information about the number of its 260 beds that are occupied. It claims that that is a matter of patient confidentiality but that is nonsense. It is known that only a handful of patients from overseas are in that hospital. Two senior consultants have resigned because there is insufficient work for them to do. Meanwhile, the few patients that have been attracted have been treated, not in Health Care International but at Yorkhill Sick Children's hospital.<br><br>
The management of HCI is drumming up business by writing to GPs in Scotland and telling them of the services that it provides. Does the Minister intend to solve its marketing problems by ensuring that NHS work will be directed its way? Alternatively, will he admit that the game plan all along, was to force NHS work into the hands of a private hospital? Will he admit that the Greater Glasgow health board, or any other health board, overestimates the number of beds that it can afford to lose under its acute services strategies? How convenient it will be to have a private hospital on its doorstep.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name one GP who has been forced to put a patient in HCI.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that any GP was forced to do so. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister must read my words in the record. I said that HCI had written to GPs to tell them of its services. Obviously, it did so with the intention of obtaining more work from the NHS. What other point could there be in writing to GPs in Scotland when the unit is supposed to be purpose-built to bring in overseas patients? It sounds to me as though it is desperately trying to make up for the fact that it cannot get any of the overseas patients that it claims it was built to deal with.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Hon. Members know that the ambulance service is applying for trust status. It claims that it will provide a better service but none of the improvements that it plans to carry out could not be achieved by a directly managed service.<br><br>
The Scottish ambulance service has a vast work load. It employs 2,700 staff and serves a population of more than 5 million. Ambulance workers carry out valuable and brave work and we cannot allow that service to be subjected to the pressure of market forces. Any change to that vital service must have proven merit, but the experiment that has been conducted down south has run into trouble. More than half the services failed to meet the emergency response time standards. Many now have a worse record than five years ago and have had to seek extra income from selling commercial services such as vehicle maintenance and advice on security systems.<br><br>
Will the Minister undertake to ensure that nothing of the sort will happen to the Scottish ambulance service? Will he explain why improvements such as the elimination of single manning of ambulances or the provision of a trained paramedic in every ambulance or emergency telephone advice cannot be accomplished under direct management? Will he admit that the Government's proposals amount to a ploy—which is not very convincing—to enable his newly-formed trust to make a good impression and gull people into thinking that trust status will make a difference for the better?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's worries about the ambulance service. She will be aware that its target was to ensure that 99 per cent. of all ambulances were double-manned by April 1994, but that target has not been reached. The problem is particularly acute in the Grampian region and rural areas. Will the hon. Lady join me in trying to persuade the Minister that additional resources should be made available to ensure the quality of service that we expect from the ambulance service?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady. She will note that I allowed her to intervene in spite of her not wearing a tie.<br><br>
In a typical trust in Scotland today, fewer than half the non-executive members have a background in health care. In a total of 102 trust board members, only 47 have such experience. We are told that they are a representative sample of the community, yet the answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) shows that the vast majority of those representatives live in the grander neighbourhoods. Of course, that should not be a bar to anyone, but there appears to be a bias towards people who do not have direct experience of poor housing, poverty and so on which are too obviously related to ill health. It is strange that neither direct experience of health care as workers nor experience of the adverse circumstances that create ill health seem to count, but links with the Tory party are held in higher esteem. There has been a lessening in respect in some quarters for the public service principles on which the NHS was built. Where better was that change for the worse displayed than in Glasgow Royal Infirmary a few months ago, when porters and cleaners were forced into wage cuts and the loss of holiday entitlements.<br><br>
I asked the Minister about the rise in administrator's pay earlier and he mentioned 0·2 per cent.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 0·6 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says 0 6 per cent.—I beg his pardon. Since 1989, the pay of chairmen and administrators of health boards has consistently risen above inflation. The only group consistently paid below inflation are ancillary workers. They took strike action, which was backed to the hilt by the Glasgow public, to make the trust see sense and reverse what should never have happened in the first place. I hope that Minsiters have learnt from that. Will the Minister say that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 will apply in future and that the Government will stop trying to evade the clear directions of the EC?<br><br>
I now refer to the recent events in the Greater Glasgow health board which show how the health service has been embarrassed. The problem at Glasgow Royal Infirmary was caused by the health board seeking tenders for a contract that was to begin several weeks after relinquishing control to the trust. Why did the health board do that? That question has never been answered. Another embarrassment is the Peterkin affair. Only a few weeks ago, Mr. Scaif reported on his findings after interviewing Greater Glasgow health board members about the process involved in sacking Mr. Peterkin. What he notably did not do was investigate events back in Edinburgh at the highest level or those that took place in the Greater Glasgow health board. An audit committee examined the circumstances of Mr. Peterkin questioning Mr. Fyfe's expenses, but there was no investigation of that or whether other health board members agreed that Mr. Peterkin should be sacked, have action taken against him that was just short of sacking, or should have no action taken against him at all. Mr. Peterkin's actions were not examined and the investigation was a whitewash.<br><br>
Will the Minsiter follow the lead of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and compile a register of members' interests for NHS trusts and health boards? If he is going to pretend that they are democratic and accountable, that is the least that he must do.<br><br>
I understand that the Secretary of State proposes to have league tables for hospitals in Scotland. Last year, I asked a simple question: how many hospitals are there in Scotland? The Minsiter could not tell me. If we are to have a league table, it may do a minor bit of good. All the teams will at least have their existence recognised in order to be placed in the league. Is not the whole concept meaningless? How can successful treatment be weighed in the balance and awarded points? How can performance-related pay be related to health care? Will a raise be paid in proportion to the number of operations carried out, with a bonus for the number of survivors? How can these be a work study of preventive health care?<br><br>
The standard of treatment delivered is crucial. No doubt the Minister has heard recent news of survival rates for breast cancer, to give one example, which show that survival rates are much better in specialist units that have built up expertise. The mere act of publishing a table will do little to help those who are not fortunate enough to gain access to the best-qualified and most experienced consultants.<br><br>
The answer is not to publish league tables but to examine how best to spread knowledge of successful techniques and how best to improve the teaching of surgeons in each speciality. We have the worst death rate from breast cancer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
in the whole of Europe. There are substantial differences in survival rates within Scotland. Each year, 200 people die because the standards in the best hospitals are not extended elsewhere. The majority of medical oncologists in Scotland are employees not of the NHS but of charities. Admirable as such charities are, why can none of that work be done within the NHS?<br><br>
The Minister referred briefly to the cause of ill health—in particular, to smoking. I agree that smoking is obviously a great danger to health. In Greater Glasgow and in Dumfries the mortality rate from lung cancer is now better than that from breast cancer. Obviously, we must do more to educate people about the dangers of smoking, but why will not the Minister agree to ban cigarette advertising? Why will not he investigate the possibility of conducting screening or taking other preventive measures to try to pull people back from the point of danger when their lungs start to collapse? That would be a worthwhile activity, and I hope that the Minister will investigate that possibility.<br><br>
It is not a matter of laying blame on people for smoking or for doing other unhealthy things. Poverty and deprivation clearly relate to the standard of people's health, and the mortality rate in the most deprived areas is double that in the most well-off areas. Poverty and deprivation relate strongly to mortality and ill-health. Ministers must address those aspects of the problem.<br><br>
Only last weekend, the Bishop of Birmingham observed that the business model for the health service is wrong. The patient is not the purchaser; the purchaser is the health authority or the fund-holding practitioner. He said that the patient is reduced to the status of a unit of consumption and exchange, and he was obsolutely right. Will the Minister dissociate himself from the remarks of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Sackville)? The hon. Gentleman had the arrogance to dismiss the bishop's remarks by saying that the bishop had
<br><blockquote><p>"put out a few lines of BMA propaganda, sprinkled with the word 'christian' from time to time."</p></blockquote>
What a way for a Minister to reply to serious worries expressed by the bishop. That arrogance is receiving its due reward in terms of the support for the Conservative party, not only in Scotland but down south. Does the Minister realise that one of the reasons that the Government have the humiliation of receiving low support of 14 per cent. in Scotland is that voters do not trust the trusts or Ministers with the health service? However, everyone should take heart, because it will not be long before we have a Labour Government, and work will begin to restore the health service to health.</span></p>
<p>11.23 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by reaffirming my belief in the national health service. I will do nothing to undermine public confidence in the NHS. There is much to be applauded in the NHS, such as the dedication of staff at every level and much surgical innovation, although I must confess that I am not entirely happy about day surgery for hysterectomies; it may be more dangerous than surgeons think. Having said that there is much good in the health service, it must be acknowledged that imperfections exist. We have a public duty to seek a remedy for them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The Government take the view that everything is fine with all the innovations, the changes in administration and the reforms such as GP fundholding. That is not the view of the British Medical Association. Yesterday its chairman, Dr. Macara, described the reforms and changes as an experiment which had failed the Government and "failed the nation". How can examinations by two sides of the same system come to such opposing conclusions? I put it down to what I call the Ceausescu factor, named after the late and unlamented President Ceausescu who believed that everything was working well in Romania.<br><br>
There are two elements to the Ceausescu factor. First, there is flattery. People who meet those in authority have a tendency to flatter, to fawn and to ingratiate themselves. The second element is the fear factor. We must deal with that real issue. Many changes are taking place in the structure of the health service and in the trusts and jobs are constantly under re-evaluation. Therefore, people are afraid that if they speak up, their jobs will be first on the line. In some trusts—I believe that it is true in Aberdeen-people are being at best discouraged and at worst prevented from raising issues with their Members of Parliament. That is perilously close to a breach of privilege and I warn the trusts that if they persist in their behaviour, I will raise the matter in that manner. Staff should be encouraged to speak up and to bring their concerns to Members of Parliament. They are part of our contact with the health service and are the people who can help us evaluate what is happening.<br><br>
At the heart of the Government's plans for the national health service is community care, which is a laudable concept. No one wants people to be kept in outdated institutions when they could be better cared for in the community. Elderly people and others should be kept in the community among their friends and family in familiar surroundings for as long as possible. I approve of the principle of community care, but all the signs are that that policy is cash driven, not patient oriented.<br><br>
A major problem with the trusts is that they produce business plans that include hospital closures when they know that there are no plans for patients in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should hold his wheesht. Grampian Healthcare has announced that Kingseat hospital, Arduthie hospital, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, and Woodlands hospital are to close. The chairman, Dr. Taylor, and the general manager, Jeremy Taylor, have told me that there are no places available in the community, particularly in relation to Arduthie and Woodlands hospitals. I am told not to worry because people will not be discharged into the community until there is adequate provision.<br><br>
That is confirmed in a letter to me from the chief executive, Jeremy Taylor.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that you will know by now that this NHS Trust does not discharge patients into the community unless we are convinced that there is appropriate adequately resourced and supported accommodation available for patients."</p></blockquote>
If that is so, what they have produced is not a business plan, but a recipe for chaos. It is a recipe for fostering private health care. If the national health service, local authorities and state bodies cannot provide community care, what is left but the private sector?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0106">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
I had a discussion recently with the manager of a private nursing home and I know that some people believe that private medicine and private medical treatment should be the first option and that national health service provision should simply be a backstop for those who cannot pay. The application of that philosophy will inexorably lead to the deterioration of the national health service as we know it. That must be rejected and resisted.<br><br>
It is fashionable to say in our debates that those who oppose changes or who are critical of them are politically motivated. The Minister came perilously close to doing so but corrected himself—he said that he had given a misleading impression and that he did not mean to attack the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not attack the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It certainly sounded like it. The fashion is to say that those who oppose changes or who are critical of them are politically motivated. Using such a label makes it easy to discount real concerns, ignore the problems and proceed as if the professionals know best. I fear that there is some danger of that happening in Aberdeen because politicians have taken up the issue, particularly that of the closure of Woodlands hospital in Aberdeen.<br><br>
Woodlands hospital specialises in the care of people who are very vulnerable and who have—in words that are, perhaps, no longer used—a mental handicap. The hospital is set in delightful surroundings and has provided an excellent service over the years and yet there is a proposal to close it.<br><br>
Anyone who has met the parents of the patients—I met a group of them on Saturday—and who knows the patients will realise that they have no political motivation. There is genuine bewilderment and parents genuinely fear for the future of their children, many of whom are adults in years. There is genuine anger about the proposed changes and real hurt in their belief that inadequate attention has been paid to the needs of the patients of Woodlands.<br><br>
The proposal to discharge at least 20 of the residents into the community is regarded with incredulity. The proposal to adapt Ross clinic—with office accommodation on the upper floor—is unacceptable to them and they do not understand why it should have been sprung on them. Contrary to the information put about by Grampian Healthcare that they were consulted months ago, the first they learnt of the changes was from the press, radio and television. Grampian Healthcare denies that these changes are driven by costs and the need to raise capital. I shall quote from Mr. Taylor's letter. In relation to Woodlands he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have no plans for the redevelopment or sale of the Woodlands site nor have we given it any serious consideration at this stage."</p></blockquote>
I wonder if he has read his business plan. The section about capital raising says that capital would be obtained from the sale of Woodlands. It is there, not in black and white but in blue and white. I do not know whether there is any political significance in that. The business plan says that future capital generation plans include the sale of the Woodlands site, so there is a contradiction.<br><br>
There is another contradiction; indeed the whole matter is full of contradictions. We are told that the staff are wholly in favour of the changes and that everyone is agreed that they are all about the patients. I know that that is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
the case. I say in parenthesis—people get into trouble from time to time—that I have not discussed Woodlands with a very close friend of mine who is involved in the medical facilities at Woodlands. I am not speaking about my close friend, who is recovering from a heart bypass operation. I have discussed the matter with people whom I do not know well but whose judgment I trust.<br><br>
Plans for the adaptation of the Ross clinic have been changed several times in the past few months and are continually being changed. I have been advised that further changes are in the pipeline. I hope that the Minister is listening because it is important. Perhaps the Minister is having what the Americans call it "time-out" but I should like to recapture his attention. Cost savings and the Government's policy of targeting bed reductions are the driving forces behind the closure of Woodlands.<br><br>
I shall quote from a presentation made on Friday 1 July to parents whose children are Woodlands patients and to the Friends of Woodlands Association, a dedicated organisation that raises funds to improve the situation at Woodlands, the presentation, which is beautifully and simply set out, gives the reasons for going ahead with the closure. One reason is
<br><blockquote><p>"Grampian Health Board's Purchasing Plan which reduces the need for the NHS beds to 75 by the year 2000".</p></blockquote>
It is there in black and white.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Care in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is beginning to wake up.
A reason for the closure of Woodlands hospital is <br><blockquote><p>Grampian Health Board's Purchasing Plan which reduces the need for the NHS beds to 75 by the year 2000".</p></blockquote>
The document gives other reasons for the closure to go ahead, which it displays in bold type under the heading "Cost effectiveness". They are:
<br><blockquote><p>"Higher percentage of the £ spent on clinical activity … Reduced management cost overall … Reduced overhead costs in heat, light, power, rates, grounds and maintenance… Reduced capital value overall and therefore reduce annual capital charge".</p></blockquote>
That is the dominant factor.<br><br>
Someone could have said, "We've done very well at Woodlands, but times have moved on. We can provide better care and service than we have on the existing site, so we propose moving the patients at Woodlands, but not all of them—20 will go into the community. We want to provide better facilities." If someone had said that six or seven months ago, that would have been fine, but it appears to have been an afterthought. We are told that there will be better facilities, but that is not possible.<br><br>
Why should we suddenly think that adapting the Ross clinic is the answer? The answer is a specialised building in beautiful surroundings.<br><br>
An unfortunate stigma still applies to the mentally ill. We have spent years trying to make the difference understood between mental illness and handicap and trying to have different kinds of care and provision. Now the two are being lumped together again.<br><br>
We do not know whether other sites were looked at. I suspect that it is simpler to sell the Woodlands site, which is free standing, than other property that the board owns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman with great interest and tolerance and I shall, if I catch your eye, Mr. Martin, talk about Woodlands', which is in my constituency.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0107">Image</span>

Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee how far Woodlands is from the specialist consultant care that the urgently hospitalised patients are likely to require? How long would it take by car, on average, to get from the specialist care at the Royal Cornhill hospital to Woodlands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for saying that Woodlands was in the constituency of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) rather than in the constituency of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. I intended no malice, nor did I intend to drive a wedge between the two aspirants for office.<br><br>
At no time in all the discussions that we have had with the chairman and the chief executive have they said that they cannot provide the specialist medical advice for patients in Woodlands, who have been there for many years. Why is the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside suddenly so concerned about the length of the journey to Woodlands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am about to answer the question. The hon. Gentleman asked how long it would take to get from the Royal Cornhill and the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to Woodlands. I suspect that it would take 15–20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a bad day, it might take 25 minutes with a lot of traffic, but ambulances could get through that. From Cornhill to the Royal Infirmary, it probably takes about five minutes. Is that okay?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting warmer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My geography of Aberdeen is not too bad after all. But if such people go by ambulance, they must wait for it to arrive. The argument has never before been advanced that, as they need such specialist, acute attention, they must be near the Royal Infirmary.<br><br>
I understand that in two days' time Grampian health board is due to consider beginning the formal consultation process for the closure of Woodlands. I wrote to Frank Hartnett, the general manager of Grampian health board, asking him not to proceed with the consultation process at this stage. Much more work needs to be done. There needs to be the fullest investigation of the whole concept. People will certainly feel that the consultation exercise is a fraud if it is proceeded with so quickly.<br><br>
I raise the matter because, in his letter to me, Mr. Taylor referred to the plans—that is, the business plans for the closure of Woodlands, about which I wrote to him. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our plans have to have the implicit support of the Health Board before they are ever made public because on the back of these plans we secure whatever capital we need from the Scottish Office to undertake improvement works and new building".</p></blockquote>
I ask the Committee and the public this question: how can those who are grievously upset have faith in a consultation process when Mr. Jeremy Taylor can say
<br><blockquote><p>"Our plans have to have the implicit support of the Health Board before they are ever made public"?</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
Will the Minister consider the matter? The health board has to conduct the consultations on his behalf. I believe that he would look askance at the idea that the business plans to close Woodlands already have the approval of Grampian health board. I hope that he will take the matter seriously.<br><br>
I finish as I began. I am proud of he health service. It should be our top priority. The needs of patients should be paramount. Considerations for the patient should override all others. I am not satisfied that that happens currently. I ask the Government to consider carefully what is happening and to introduce a hiatus on hospital closures until we see exactly how community care is working. Otherwise, patients will simply be cast about from one place to another because they are part of a business plan and are not part of a patient care plan.</span></p>
<p>11.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) on the matter of the right of constituents, especially those employed in the public sector, to consult Members. The cornerstone of the United Kingdoms' unwritten constitution is the Members' right to ask questions on behalf of their constituents and to have those questions answered in this place. I should be happy to join the hon. Gentleman at any time in defending that right.<br><br>
In Scotland, especially in Tayside, we have possibly the finest health service to be found anywhere in the world. I do not say that lightly. I believe that to be true.<br><br>
In his introduction to the debate, my hon. Friend the Minister said that services had to be close to patients. I wrote that down because it was fascinating. I never thought that the day would come when I should support moves to have a judicial review on the decision to close a popular cottage hospital in my constituency. The judicial review has not yet started, Mr. Martin, so it is not sub judice. For over 20 years, the Tayside health board and its predecessor body have tried to close a very popular cottage hospital in my constituency. The hospital was a memorial gift by Lady Cox, in memory of her late husband. At the same time, she gave a substantial endowment which guaranteed the future of that hospital for ever, including the costs of maintenance and rebuilding, if necessary.<br><br>
The consultations on the closure—because of the time involved—can only be described as protracted and farcical. I believe that we shall prove that at the judicial review.<br><br>
It is interesting to note that the GPs, the health council, the region, and the district and community councils all oppose the closure of the hospital. The facts that were given to the Scottish Office were not only inaccurate but were deliberately altered to suit the case. It is proposed to use the hospital as a day-care facility. There has been one informal meeting about that. No discussions have occurred in which proper costing has been carried out.<br><br>
I have been informed that the costs of maintaining a daycare facility, especially those of transporting patients to it, will be as great as those of keeping the hospital open. I visited the hospital last Friday. I was pleased to note that, with one exception, the beds were, as always, full. The hospital is popular.<br><br>

I have been brief, as I promised. A judicial review will now be called for.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about health care because south Ayrshire has endured the so-called market in health care and the producer-provider dichotomy longer than any other part of the United Kingdom, apart from Aberdeen. I agree strongly with the words of the Bishop of Birmingham, and those of Sandy Macara, a Scotsman who is chairman of the British Medical Association. Yesterday, in his address to the BMA, he described the market system as a disaster. It has been a disaster for reasons that we predicted.<br><br>
The Opposition warned the Government about the difficulties that would arise. Almost every prediction has come true. I have already mentioned switching resources away from primary health care to the bureaucrats. Dare I say it to the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, but I did not refer to clerks and other low-paid bureaucrats; my comments applied to the higher bureaucrats—those who receive free cars and huge salary increases. The number of those bureaucrats has doubled since the introduction of the reforms. That is a disgrace.<br><br>
Double the amount of money has been spent on bureaucrats. That has doubled the work that nurses and doctors have to do, because they are required to fill in more and more forms. Yet the number of nurses in Ayrshire has decreased by 300 to pay for the bureaucrats. That is crazy, because patient care suffers. Some spectacular, unfortunate examples of that have occurred in Ayrshire. The press has highlighted some of them. Some patients, especially those who are elderly, have suffered horrific bedsores. I have raised the matter on several occasions. I do not blame individual nurses. Too few nurses are being asked to do too much; they are being asked to work too many hours. The system is to blame.<br><br>
Reality is not what the Minister reads from a prepared text, which is produced by civil servants, who have a vested interest in perpetuating a myth to keep their Ministers happy. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister will have an opportunity to reply; I look forward to that.<br><br>
We hear constantly that "the throughput is up". The Minister repeated that claim this morning. The Government treat hospitals as though they were factories with production lines. The more they get through the production line, the better. But that is not the case. As my hon. Friend the Member for Marybill said in her powerful speech, people are being forced out of hospital too early.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that medical technology and treatment have changed dramatically? Some treatments which involved a hospital stay of a few days now require only a day in hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I accept that. But I also know that some people are discharged too early. I have been given example after example of that in Ayr hospital in my constituency. Those people have to be re-admitted to hospital and appear as other patients in the statistics. There is double counting and sometimes triple counting. The irony is that because patients are pushed out early, they increase the throughput statistics of the hospital. That is why the Government's statistics are a disgrace.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although no one wants to spend longer in hospital than necessary, if people are discharged early, they need support services in the community, and many people are deprived of those services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to speak for too long, as I want all members of the Committee to have an opportunity to speak.<br><br>
My next point relates to the increased commercialisation of the health service, which is appalling. I do not know whether the same happens in other areas, but in my area the chairmen and chief executives of the trusts talk about enterprises, and use terms such as efficiency, instead of care and compassion—the sort of words that were used in the past.<br><br>
As part of that trend, the South Ayrshire trust has entered into the most astonishing deal with a fundholding practice in Northern Ireland, which almost everyone in Ayrshire condemns. One wee fellow thinks that it is a good idea, but very few others are in favour of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with that point. There is nothing wrong with Northern Ireland, but why should people from Northern Ireland have to travel to Ayrshire for orthopaedic treatment? It should be provided in Belfast. That is where the problem should be solved. That commercial deal, which is what it is, means that the fundholding practice in Northern Ireland enables its patients to jump the queue ahead of patients who have been on the waiting list for months in Ayrshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that patients go from Ayrshire and Arran health board area and from Ayrshire as a whole to the Glasgow health board area to obtain services such as cancer medication and neurology treatment? Is not that right, and is not that the way the national health service should work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where services are not available in Ayrshire, there have been agreements with the Greater Glasgow health board, but the health board in Ayrshire and the trusts are trying to make more services available locally in Ayrshire. It is right that that should be done. We do not want patients coming from other parts of the country and jumping the queue because they are the patients of fundholding doctors. If the market is developed, there will be patients criss-crossing the entire country. It is south-west Scotland for orthopaedics now, and next it may be England for cardiac surgery and perhaps Wales for ear, nose and throat treatment. That would be ridiculous. It would be wonderful for the ferry companies, but not very good for the national health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried that my hon. Friend is making such statements about Northern Ireland, as the Lothian health board may hear about them. People attending the Princess Margaret Rose hospital in Edinburgh cannot receive physiotherapy because the department has been closed for three months. I have written to find out the reason but I have not yet received a reply. I hope that patients will not have to travel to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
Northern Ireland for treatment. Some economic experts may have become involved and worked out a deal, but the people who need physiotherapy—because of disablement, for example—are being deprived of it. That is the point that I tried to make when the Minister would not allow me to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. We do not want patients travelling all over the country. The Minister said, and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) rightly pointed out, that services should be provided as close as possible to the patient. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind, and that he will ask his right hon. and noble Friend the Minister of State to examine the Northern Ireland contract. It is outrageous and must be stopped. People all over Ayrshire are up in arms against it.<br><br>
My next point relates to competition. There is now competition between trusts in Ayrshire, which is unhelpful. Trusts are reluctant to provide information to Members of Parliament and the public because of commercial confidentiality. The plan for the development of Ballochmyle, which should have gone ahead months ago, has been held back because another trust has come up with a proposal that it considers might be cheaper. The Minister in the Scottish Office who is responsible for health encouraged the trust to do that because he prefers cheaper treatment to better treatment. He wants another trust to put forward a scheme that might be cheaper than that proposed by the South Ayrshire trust. Care should be the criterion by which the issue should be judged, not the cost.<br><br>
The Ailsa hospital is our county's psychiatric hospital. It has a long and good tradition. Now, however, morale in the hospital is at its lowest ever. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North about community care. It is okay in theory but, in practice, all the facilities must be in the community before people are discharged. In the Ailsa hospital, one third of its staff—an astonishing number-are on temporary contracts. They are unsure about their long-term future. Such an arrangement creates uncertainty about jobs. It is not good for their confidence or their enthusiasm for their work. They cannot obtain mortgage cover or other facilities. The Minister must deal with that. Why are so many people in the health service on temporary contracts? It is creating so much uncertainty.<br><br>
I have read all the glossy brochures produced by the Scottish ambulance service, and I could not find one reason why it should become a trust. The only possible advantage is that those who run the trust, such as Andrew Fremantle and Mr. McVitie, will, like other trust chairmen and directors, receive salary increases. That happens constantly when trusts are created. Bosses get more money, while workers get less and are subjected to poorer conditions of service. It would be bad if that happened in the ambulance service. Experience has shown that ambulance trusts in England, are not a success.<br><br>
Ayrshire is a model of what not to do in the national health service; it shows the direction in which not to go. We now have four administrations—a board and three trusts. Let us consider all the costs involved in paying the salaries and expenses of their members, whereas before there was only one administration. It means less money for patient care. People are talking about enterprise and profit in the health service, not about care and compassion. The morale of doctors and nurses in Ayrshire is at its lowest ever.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill ended her speech in such a way. I say to her and to my right hon. and hon. Friends in the shadow Cabinet and elsewhere that, when the Labour party takes office at the next election, we must get rid of such market philosophy in the health service. It is completely inappropriate. We must scrap the purchaser-provider division and return to providing a universal health service that is free to people at the point of delivery, according to need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We must bring in accountability to the public and to elected representatives. Priority must be given to the front line carers—the nurses and doctors—not to the men and women in grey suits. At the first opportunity, we must sweep out the Tory stooges such as Aileen Bates, Susan Bell and others who are running the health service in Scotland. We must bring in those who represent the true interests of the people.</span></p>
<p>11.59 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was compulsory to wear a tie before one was called to speak.<br><br>
Hedgehogs are my favourite mammals. I build little nests for them during the winter months. I have a collection of no fewer than 50 hedgehogs. Perhaps the Minister will bear that in mind when I want to intervene in his speech.<br><br>
I wish to make some serious points, and it is essential that the Minister responds to them effectively because the health service is of great concern not only to Members of Parliament but to all our constituents. This issue regularly crops up in our surgeries and mailbags.<br><br>
I start with community care because its implementation in Scotland is not proceeding smoothly, despite it having been a high-spending commitment by the Government. The main problems seem to be the difficulties that have been experienced in joint working between the different agencies, particularly health and social workers. Protocols on patient discharge from hospitals are not legally enforceable, so there is a problem with people falling through the net, and I am most concerned about them.<br><br>
What actions will the Government take to improve interdisciplinary working to ensure a smoother implementation of community care? That vital matter engages the minds of all involved in health care, social workers and, of course, the families of people receiving treatment.<br><br>
I refer in particular to those who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. I am greatly involved in that issue. The Minister should look at early-day motion 1430, which has been tabled today in recognition of Alzheimer's awareness week. Throughout the UK there are 154,000 people with dementia who are living alone, and Scotland has a percentage of them. Those people are greatly at risk and are very dependent on individual carers, who are usually family members, but they are also dependent to a great extent on other services that are available in the community. They need access to long-term care, perhaps residential care, and I ask whether the Government have taken account of the hope held out by drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>
Hopes are often raised that there will be a miracle drug that can cure that disease which is so distressing for the sufferers and their relatives. However, we know that there are no miracle cures, and I wonder what research into drug
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
treatment is being undertaken in the Scottish Home and Health Department and what provision is made for those in our society who suffer from dementia in its many forms.<br><br>
More attention should be paid to the carers who sacrifice their lives to look after members of their families. I do not believe that we provide them with the statutory support that they so rightly deserve. The same is true of those who suffer from physical handicaps. Their carers, too, are often not given the support that they merit, so I hope that the Government will consider that matter very seriously.<br><br>
Also in the context of community care, will the Minister confirm that the Government's frequently stated proposals for a 50 per cent. reduction in chronic bed provision by the year 2005 have been withdrawn? I hope that they have. I also hope that he will accept that the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 cannot be operated equitably as currently drafted unless we ensure that there is adequate chronic bed provision.<br><br>
Will the Minister also confirm that there are wide differences in the national health service in Scotland in bed provision for the elderly, depending on the prevailing view of health boards and their interpretation of the 1990 Act? For example, it would interest the Committee if he could provide statistics on Dumfries and Galloway.<br><br>
The acute sector of the organisation was the subject of one of my earlier interventions. What information does the Minister have to justify the idea that there should be a 30 per cent. reduction in beds? According to the <i>Daily Record</i> of 23 June 1994,15,600 beds may be closed in Scotland, so I should like to know the information on which the Minister bases his predictions.<br><br>
I also ask the Minister to consider the point that I raised with the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) about the need for people to have post-operative support in the community if they are discharged from hospital very early. An example is a woman who has had a hysterectomy by the new laser treatment which obviates the previous methods of surgery. If the woman has a young family, she will need support when she returns home; she cannot resume her normal life immediately, so we must ensure that faculties such as community nurses, home helps and so on are available to help her.<br><br>
That brings me to the subject of community nursing numbers. As we move towards community care and early discharge from hospital, we must consider the number of nurses who should be trained in community services. That number is being reduced. A recent report from the Royal College of Nursing showed a 20 per cent. drop in the number of nurses in training in Scotland since 1990. The figure decreased from 10,200 in 1990 to 8,167 last year. That shift is particularly alarming as we move towards community care and an increasingly elderly population. The Government's health targets demand more skilled nurses, not fewer. In 1989 in Scotland, more than 100 district nurses were being trained, whereas about one tenth of that number will be trained this year. What action will the Government take to improve resources for community nurses in Scotland and to ensure that adequate numbers are trained?<br><br>
I share the anxieties that have already been expressed about the possibility of the ambulance service taking up trust status. The examples that we have seen elsewhere do not augur well for such a move. I refer to the crew of two in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
ambulances. According to Mr. Fremantle, the general manager of the ambulance service, the target was to ensure that 99 per cent. of all ambulances were dual-manned by April 1994. There is a 3 per cent. shortfall in the whole of Scotland and a 4 per cent. shortfall in the Grampian region. As a representative of one of the Grampian seats, I find that shortfall worrying.<br><br>
The figures for single manning are as follows: Elgin 16; Buckie 11; Dufftown 24, Tomintoul 4; Forres 194, and Keith 22. In Fraserburgh, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), the number of single-manned ambulances is 33. In Huntly it is 69 and 15 in Peterhead. There is deep concern about that high level of single-manning, especially given the distances involved. It is a life-or-death service. People need easy and quick access to an ambulance and someone who can support them in a crisis.<br><br>
Orthodontology is another problem. I have had letters from many constituents and medical practices telling me that the waiting time for a youngster to see an orthodontic specialist is 18 months. Patients' problems are exacerbated by long waiting lists, and ultimately more costly treatment is required. That affects young people especially, and I wonder what can be done to ensure that additional facilities are available in Elgin for that specialist need.<br><br>
I am very worried about what is happening in the national health service. We have seen reports in various newspapers about the British Medical Association's conference. The BMA refers to the plague of red tape and the amount of money that is being spent on bureaucracy. There is an idea that money is being ploughed back into patient care when in fact, it is being used for bureaucracy and administrative costs. Many young doctors feel that their needs are being ignored and that they are being pressured. Whatever the Secretary of State for Health and the Government say, the morale of many who are committed and dedicated to the national health service is at an all-time low. As legislators, we have a responsibility to examine the reforms carefully and to ensure that we consider the people who are at the sharp end and who deliver a service way beyond the call of duty. Many work long hours and are available to their patients day and night. We have a responsibility to ensure that reforms involve those at the sharp end. We must give them the level of commitment that they give to us.</span></p>
<p>12.9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare a marital interest. My wife is a medical practitioner and a member of the British Medical Association—for the meantime. I question whether she will remain with the BMA for much longer after Dr. Sandy Macara's comments yesterday. To hear the Opposition I begin to question whether we are living in the same country with the same national health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You can say that again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am exceedingly proud of the national health service in Scotland and, in particular, in the northeast. I shall take this opportunity to praise all the doctors, nurses and staff, including Grampian health board and the administrators. They are doing an exceedingly fine job in the north-east of Scotland. We have heard much about the number of patients being treated—whether in-patients or day-patients. In the year ended 31 March 1994,952,227 inpatients and 284,972 day-patients were treated in Scotland.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
That represents an increase of 1 per cent. and 17 per cent. respectively over the previous year, and 6 per cent. and 53 per cent. respectively since 1990. That shows that the national health service is delivering in the interests of the patient. It is performing more operations; it is seeing more in-patients, out-patients and day patients; and waiting lists are being reduced. Better facilities are available, too.<br><br>
I had the pleasure of making a social visit to the constituency of the hon. Member for Moray, to my home town of Elgin. I was very pleased to see the developments being made on the £22 million Dr. Gray's hospital extension. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I would not want to argue about £1 million—it could be £22 million or £23 million. Nevertheless, the national health service has provided a new hospital which is giving local service to the people of Moray, whom I remember felt isolated between Aberdeen and Inverness. Local delivery is what the Government's policy on the NHS is about. A good service for patients is the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that in 1993, the number of in-patients on the repeat waiting list was 3,484 and that the number of day cases on the repeat waiting list was 6,909? Is that what the hon. Gentleman calls a success?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady does her sums in percentages, she will find that it is a low percentage. We must accept that occasionally there will be re-admissions, not necessarily because patients have been released early but because complications have developed. That is what medicine is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the repeat list covers those who suffer from horrendous illnesses such as cancer, when there is an inevitability of repeat2 The hon. Lady ignores that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is typical of all the statistics of the hon. Member for Maryhill and those of other Opposition Members. They make sweeping declarations without getting behind the figures or trying to understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to continue now, but I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman later.<br><br>
Not only have reforms taken place in hospitals but there have been GP fundholding increases. They have achieved greater flexibility and a greater opportunity to ensure that the services that are delivered are in the interests of their patients. It is easy to say that the patient is more remote from services, but the GP, who is closer to them, is the best judge of what his patients require. It is the GP who deals personally with the patient.<br><br>
The health reforms are working well, especially in Grampian. It is interesting that the bishop to whom reference was made earlier by Opposition Members was quiet about the fact that his wife is the chairwoman of an NHS trust. That there is a split household on such a subject makes life interesting.<br><br>
I refer now to the comments made yesterday by the chairman of the British Medical Association Council, Dr. Sandy Macara. If we are to have developments in the health service, provide better treatment and improve on what I consider to be a very good service, we do not want
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
confrontation. The comments that were made by Dr. Macara will not go down particularly well with the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary trust, for example, which is still suffering as a result of the comments made by the hon. Members for Aberdeen, North and for Gordon. Prior to its formation, they were against the trust.<br><br>
I shall list some of the better facilities that have been put in place since that trust was formed two years ago. During that time, treatments for children have improved: bone marrow transplants are now available. Heart bypass surgery has increased significantly. About 400 heart bypasses a year now take place, compared with about 50 such operations a year four years ago.<br><br>
Reference was made to patients who are released from hospital more quickly than before and to their being day-patients rather than longer-term in-patients. That is evident in the services provided by the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary's trust at Foresterhill. A new treatment for kidney stones at the hospital is by ultrasound. The machine used for such treatment costs about £1 million. Given the throughput at the hospital, it would not be justified to purchase such a machine outright.<br><br>
However, since the hospital has become a trust, it has had more flexibility to provide different services and, as a result, it can lease the equipment for three days every three weeks. It can treat nine patients a day for kidney stones. Patients go into hospital in the morning and can see on the screen their kidney stones dissolve. They are made to consume a vast quantity of liquid but, by, the end of the day, they go home without kidney stones. That treatment is suitable for about 90 per cent. of the patients who have that complaint.<br><br>
The trust has extra clinics, which have been the subject of previous debates. It has evening out-patient clinics and it tries to tailor them to the requirements of patients who are unable to attend clinics during the working day. Patients now have gynaecology and neurology clinics. There is even a teenage clinic for young people who cannot attend during school hours.<br><br>
<i>The Times</i> reported what Dr. Macara said yesterday. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the NHS must be focused on meeting the needs of patients sensitively and equitably, and priorities must be set on the basis of justice and compassion."</p></blockquote>
That is something in which I believe completely. Aberdeen Royal Infirmary trust has set up such an arrangement. I refer to its ward in which patients receive chemotherapy and where, sadly, those suffering from cancer may well end their days. Given the nature of such wards, patients may not be able to experience the family closeness and involvement for which they might wish and which husbands and wives desire.<br><br>
The sensitivity of such a situation has been recognised, and ward 46 in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary trust is now equipped with double-bedded rooms. Patients can spend their days—they might be their last—with their nearest and dearest in close proximity. Families can be together. Health care is about sensitivity; it is nonsense to claim that the national health service does not observe that.<br><br>
Almost last, but not least, a good aspect of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary trust's work is that matron is back. Hospitals have welcomed that for many years. I am pleased that matron has a role in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary trust, even though I disagree with her occasionally and she is difficult to recognise because she does not wear a uniform.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or a tic.<br><br>
Before the trust was formed, many Opposition Members, such as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North emphasised the difficulties of staff relations and claimed that the medical profession would oppose the trust. I understand that reservations and anxieties exist before a reform takes place. However, the hon. Gentleman knows that a successful joint staff consultation and negotiating committee, which embraces 13 trade unions, operates at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary trust. In the first report meeting on 27 August 1993, two members from the staff side claimed, without prompting or pressure, that the staff and the unions had been wrong. They hoped that the politicians would go away and leave them to provide health care for their patients. That lesson should spread and be applied to current circumstances in, for example, two hospitals in my constituency: Arduthie hospital in Stonehaven and Woodlands hospital in Cults.<br><br>
As the hon. Members for Aberdeen North and for Gordon know, Grampian Healthcare has only just published a three-year business plan. By definition, a business plan is an outline strategy for trying to secure funding to carry out objectives. At this stage, the plan must include capital requirements for improvements to hospitals. That will lead to rationalisation and possibly to closure of other hospitals.<br><br>
Let us consider the easier example, which directly affects me, but does not involve the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North: Arduthie hospital in Stonehaven. There are two hospitals in Stonehaven—Arduthie and Woodcot. Woodcot tends to be used for long-term, geriatric cases. I welcome care in the community and I am pleased that the hon. Members for Aberdeen, North and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) welcome it in theory. Care in the community means that we do not want elderly people to be consigned to an institutional sort of hospital sooner than they need to be. That is a sign of a compassionate health service. We must try to keep such people in normal circumstances for as long as possible. That requires better community services, such as nursing assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Erie Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Put your money where your mouth is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have put money where our mouth is. I could argue that it is conceivable at this early stage that we have given too much money to community health care. However, as the more difficult, marginal cases are put into the community, more money will be required. One of the senior consultants at Woodlands hospital said that to me. He is worried that, although terms are currently generous, budgeting will be required as time goes on.<br><br>
Grampian Healthcare's business plan proposed the closure of Arduthie hospital, due to increased care-in-the-community requirements, and the resultant reductions in hospital beds; and the modification of Woodcot hospital to form the one rationalised hospital in Stonehaven. I visited both hospitals. I believe that both are totally unsuitable for further development. I went to see my noble Friend the Minister of State and told him that Grampian Healthcare had opted for a short cut, whereas the proper solution would be to close both hospitals and to construct a new, purpose-built hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. As a result of that meeting, although my noble Friend gave no commitments, he agreed that Grampian Healthcare could submit a further option appraisal and try to come up with a proposal for a new hospital. I hope that Grampian Healthcare can justify that. It is constructive health care to try to get the best solution for patients in Stonehaven.<br><br>
I appreciate that other hon. Members want to speak, so I shall not take interventions. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) wants to talk about Ayr. I want to talk briefly about Woodlands, which I visited at the beginning of June. I have also been to the building which is currently called the Ross clinic at the Royal Cornhill hospital. We are talking about a business plan. Until the formal proposals are published and consultation starts, we must be careful about saying that desperate cases who need to be hospitalised—there are some desperate cases—should not be moved to a facility that is much closer to the consultants at the Royal Cornhill hospital.<br><br>
The building work has involved significantly the friends of Woodlands hospital. I believe that there was a further meeting with the friends just a couple of days ago to update them on the building proposals. When modified, that building may conceivably be most appropriate for those who desperately need hospitalisation. I accept that the last time that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North visited Woodlands he thought that the surroundings were pleasant, but it is much more cramped than the site of the Ross clinic at the Royal Cornhill hospital. That clinic is right at the edge of the Royal Cornhill site. It has beautiful lawns and rhododendrons. It is a beautiful site which, if properly built on, could provide a very good facility.<br><br>
The jury should not begin its consideration at this stage but should stay out until the proposals are firm. Rather than knocking the proposals and walking down Union Street saying negatively, "Save our hospitals", the hon. Gentleman should come up with constructive proposals on how he thinks that the health system could be further improved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that we have a business plan which, simply and unequivocally, states that Woodlands will be closed and that capital will be generated from the sale of the site. That is clear for all to read. That the plans for the Ross clinic have not yet been finalised is confirmation that the business plan comes first and the needs of the patient come second. Consultation does not mean stating in a business plan that a hospital is closing, that a site is being sold and that we shall now discuss what to do. That is bad medicine. It is bad for the patients and for the relatives who have been treated badly. The case has been put in the most inappropriate way, given the type of patient in Woodlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but he is being rather naive. A business plan must come first in outline before the detailed proposals can be discussed. I accept that the consultation could perhaps have been better, but I believe that it is now quite good and that the friends of Woodlands hospital are being consulted. I do not want to go further. I simply suggest that the jury should stay out until there are firm proposals.<br><br>
I want to make one final point, briefly, about general practice. I support the views of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) who talked about the pressure of work on general practitioners. Some health
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
proposals involved establishing specialist trauma centres in Scotland. That was coupled with general practitioners having to take on more local casualty work. I welcome the fact that that will mean more local facilities, but I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to pass on to his ministerial colleagues my worry that there should be adequate consultation with GPs to ensure that they are not asked to do something for which, practically, they do not have the time.<br><br>
The health service has been in incredibly good hands under this Government—we have had remarkable success. I hope that the health service will continue to be in the Government's hands for a long time.</span></p>
<p>12.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be as brief as possible. I like hedgehogs—they are marvellous animals, but they are killed on the road because they cover themselves against danger. The Government are a bit like hedgehogs. They are totally oblivious to public opinion and they will be politically squashed in the near future.<br><br>
There are cuts in facilities in Midlothian—for example, in the Princess Margaret Rose Infirmary. A case has been made for a hospital called the New Royal Infirmary to be built. The foundation stones have not yet been laid, but the ground has been bought. When will it be built? When are you going to put your money where your mouth is—capital expenditure on major hospital? I am not saying "you" to you Mr. Martin, I mean the Minister. I am sorry, Mr. Martin, I do not blame you. The word "you" seems to be a habit of mine.<br><br>
Facilities for the chronically ill elderly in Midlothian are overdue—I have spoken to the person in charge of them. I agree with the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside that people should be kept in the community and that facilities should be built in the community. However, current facilities should not be closed down until there are new ones. There is no co-ordination, and in my constituency there is a huge backlog in necessary facilities. At 6 pm tonight, chronically ill young people will form an all-party group because there is a need to discuss, in depth, how the national health service is letting down chronically ill people.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside mentioned a group of GPs; they have made some constructive suggestions. They want to put emergency primary care in their area. However, Lothian health service said that it did not have the money. Five to seven practices want such care in the clinic at Bonnyrigg, but they do not have the money. Such a clinic would relieve pressure on hospitals and emergency care units in Edinburgh. It would mean that the public could go to a place close to them. It would also mean that there will be a cut in emergency calls in the evening. That is sensible—it would cost not millions of pounds but a few hundred thouands pounds to get it off the ground. It would lessen the backlog and certainly take pressure off GPs in those groups. We need to invest in such proposals and ideas.<br><br>
When the ambulance service made cuts and centralised its service in Edinburgh, to the detriment of Penicuik and areas which I represent, I visited the ambulance service. Many of the ambulances were old and in need of renewal and updating. There was also a difficulty with blackspots within the hills of the Moorfoot. The ground is not level; radio signals do not always go the way one wants them to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
go. The service had to eradicate those two difficulties. I see no benefit in putting trust status on those ambulance services. They cannot be more efficient in tackling those problems and providing a better service, such as a reduction in the call-out time, as they promised that they would as a result of centralisation. They may be more efficient by cutting numbers or cutting corners and by giving themselves a perk. Will there be more BMW cars for the people who are running the service? One cannot get into the car parks of hospitals in Lothian. I do not know why they have BMWs—it might be because of their aggressive attitude and because it suits them to be that sort of driver. That is the type of status symbol they want; they will probably want Rolls-Royces next. I do not know whether they have enough cash to do that.<br><br>
It is wrong to think that everything is grand and rosy in the health service. People could tell that to people outside until they were blue in the face. We are speaking the truth, perhaps very brutally, and the Government may not wish to hear it, but those are the facts of life. All those in situ in the Government's quangos are telling them what they want to hear but they are not telling the whole truth because there is a great deal of criticism of the national health service in Scotland.</span></p>
<p>12.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If members of the public who work in the health service or have recently used it were to read the report of the speeches of Conservative Members, they would be struck by the enormous gap between their experience of what the health service is like and the headline figures and sweeping claims that have been provided by those hon. Members. I shall deal with aspects of that experience later but first, I shall examine those figures and claims.<br><br>
The Minister started by claiming a 5.3 per cent. increase in expenditure. The contrast between the outturn expenditure last year and the planned expenditure this year is 4.7 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should never do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I should not do that but that is the method used by the Treasury. Everybody knows that health service inflation is greater than general inflation and that the health service has to keep spending more because of our increasing elderly population. Everybody also knows that it has to spend more because of advances in medical technology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is not quite the fact of the matter? My hon. Friend the Minister referred to changes in technology and the methods of carrying out operations and cited the specific example of stones. That might lead to a vast reduction of the burden of the cost for such treatment on the health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am only repeating a fact that is well known by all health experts and health economists, notwithstanding what the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) said. An additional cost is arising because of the increasing proverty of sections of society. An alarming report appeared in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> a week or two earlier which stated that the mortality rates of some low income sections of the population are increasing in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
absolute terms. The Government should consider the effects of their policies on the health of the population, the latest example of which is VAT on fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way shortly but I have only 10 minutes in which to speak and many matters to discuss.<br><br>
There are additional costs that the health service has to meet and I shall mention two. First, there is the overlapping expenditure that will exist for a few years. As the community care infrastructure is put in place, we have to keep the institutional care going until that process is completed. So there will be overlapping costs for a year or two as well as the additional expenditure involved in setting up trusts. For example, I believe that £500,000 has been given as a form of dowry to the trusts in Lothian this year to set up its internal bureaucracy. So there will be additional expenditure because of the changes that the Government are making.<br><br>
The Minister's second point was about reduced waiting lists. I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said about deferred waiting lists but I mention two other matters. First, the waiting list for day-care patients is at an all-time high and, of course, many have transferred from the in-patient waiting list to the day-care waiting list.<br><br>
Secondly, the time taken for a GP to refer a patient to a specialist is not included in the waiting list time. Although the patients charter states that there should be nine weeks between a patient going to a GP and a referral to an outpatient clinic, that takes up to 30 weeks for some specialties in Lothian. One of the more alarming aspects of that is urology, given that the rate of prostate cancer has doubled in the past 20 years.<br><br>
The third point made by the Minister was repeated by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch), namely, that more people are being treated, and so they should be because of advances in medical technology. That would happen irrespective of any reforms or changes, but we must also consider that the way in which the numbers are calculated has been changed. It is now based on consultant care episodes and research in England has shown that that inflates the figure by 11 per cent. Of course, numbers say nothing about the quality of care and I, like most Opposition Members who have spoken, pay tribute to the excellent work done by everybody who works in the health service. However, if there are staff shortages or if patients leave earlier, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, that will affect the quality of care.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray referred to the decreasing number of nurses being trained and I know about that from my own experience. I have received correspondence from more than one constituent complaining about the number of nurses on a ward. When I wrote to the Western General hospital in Edinburgh about that matter at the end of March, it admitted that it was short of nurses and said that it would try to solve the problem. But this year, as in all years, because of efficiency savings, the Western General and all hospitals are being asked to deliver the same amount of care for 2 per cent. less money. How can it increase the number of nurses? While the number of nurses has declined, there has been a massive increase in the number of managers and, since 1989, the money spent on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
managers has increased by 160 per cent. The Minister blames that on reclassification. That is a very small part of that increased cost.<br><br>
The Minister spoke glowingly about GP fundholding. With colleagues, I met Lothian health board executives on Friday. One of the most alarming things that I discovered was that, by April next year, 30 per cent. of patients in Lothian will have been treated by GP fundholders—the same figure as in England. That is being driven by the Scottish Office; it gave that target to all health boards. We all know what is happening in England through GP fundholding—a two-tier service. It is most alarming that the Scottish Office insists on that target.<br><br>
Another factor that came out in research last week in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> is that in many parts of England more money per patient is being spent on the patients of GP fundholders than on those of non fund holders. Such inequity is being driven into the system in Scotland by the Scottish Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I have only five minutes so I cannot give way. If I have time, I shall do so when I have finished my remarks.<br><br>
The Minister praised care for the elderly. He said that continuing care would be tailored to meet the needs of individuals. As I look ahead, I think that it will be tailored to the income rather than to the needs of individuals. The drastic reduction in the number of continuing care beds provided by the health service means that local authorities will have to provide them. As we all know, that will mean means testing and many people will have to pay for their care. Moreover, a circular from the Scottish Office insists that a high percentage of that is provided by the private sector. That happens in England and the Scottish Office is now driving through in Scotland. Part of the reforms is about encouraging provision by private providers. That is also what the experience of Health Care International tells us, a matter that was well covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill.<br><br>
I wish to mention some specific concerns before I finish. One is cancer treatment. There has been quite a lot of publicity about that in <i>The Scotsman</i> recently and I have been very involved as I am secretary of the all-party group on breast cancer. Many statistics on cancer are getting worse. The week before last, the articles in <i>The Scotsman</i> highlighted the disparities in treatment in different parts of Scotland. I hope that the Government are dealing with that alarming fact. There are two aspects of that. First, there are only eight medical oncologists in Scotland and only three of them are paid for by the NHS. I hope that that will be tackled as a matter of urgency. We need more cancer specialists. The group of which I am secretary has been told., that time and again by experts who have spoken to us. We have also been told that patients must be referred to specialists. I hope that the Government will look to having more specialists and to creating more specialist units. Only in those ways can the unequal treatment for cancer be dealt with in Scotland.<br><br>
Cancer may require centralised and specialised treatment. However, in certain kinds of care the mania for centralisation has gone too far. We must distinguish between cancer and certain other services. One which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
topical in Lothian is maternity care. I know that the acute services strategy for Lothian is with the Minister. The original suggestion was that there should be maternity services in Edinburgh in both the new Royal Infirmary and in the Western General hospital. Now, a few health care professionals are trying to drive through over-centralisation and to have everything at the new Royal Infirmary. I hope that the Minister will reject that when he deals with the acute services strategy as it is undoubtedly rejected by the people in my constituency.<br><br>
Will the Minister say when the new hospital in Lothian will be built? It is, of course, the foundation of the acute services strategy? The Treasury approved it six months ago; when will he give the go-ahead? We in Edinburgh will not be very amused if a new Forth road bridge is built before a new hospital. We will not welcome a new Forth road bridge at all. The increased number of cars will do nothing for the health of the people of Edinburgh, as borne out by the increase in asthma cases.<br><br>
We have heard about the problems that are being dealt with by the health service. Let me conclude by mentioning problems that are not being dealt with, one of which is asthma. I have had several letters recently from constituents who cannot get nebulisers provided by the national health service, even though they have been told that they need thm. One woman told me that she had had to approach a church charity to get one for her young child. I hope that the problem will be tackled by the Scottish Office.<br><br>
Infertility treatment is uneven. In vitro fertilisation is available on the national health service in Glasgow but not in Edinburgh. Several people have approached me about that.<br><br>
We have heard today a staggering example of Government complacency. The experience of people on the ground is that there are serious problems in the health service which have been made worse by the changes that have taken place, and are likely to become even more serious as further changes, such as GP fundholding, go ahead. I hope that the Government will listen to the people who know—those who work in the health service and those who use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that bigotry and prejudice should have no place in the health service and, in particular, that people who stir the pot of bigotry and prejudice should have no place on the Southern General hospital trust? Does he agree that the honourable thing for the Minister to do would be to sack Mrs. Susan Bell from the Southern General hospital trust because of her disgraceful behaviour during the Monklands, East by-election? That would give people in Scotland confidence that sectarianism has no place in the health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and I hope that the Minister will respond to his point.</span></p>
<p>12.46 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a great pity that a generally constructive and well informed debate on the health service should be marred by that entirely unjustified remark from the hon. Member for Govan, whose sole purpose was to get a cheap headline in tomorrow's newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. Sit down.<br><br>
Many constructive points were made in the debate. I was sorry that the hon. Member for Leith criticised the health service in general in Scotland, as against the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North, for example, who had specific criticisms but paid tribute to the health service in Scotland [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] I am delighted that my reference to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North has received such applause from Opposition Members, and I hope that my other references to hon. Members will receive equal applause from Labour Members.<br><br>
Surveys show that more than eight out of 10 people are satisfied with the service that they receive from the national health service in Scotland. They are satisfied with the amount of information given, with the degree of involvement in decision making and with linkages between different people involved in their health care. They are satisfied that they are treated as individuals, not as cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must proceed, but I will give way to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to emphasise those points. The level of satisfaction with the national health service in Scotland is extremely high. It is the political body and the trade union body who constantly complain about services. My hon. Friend should listen to the public when considering how to take the national health service forward in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Opposition Members spoke about waiting times and, if time permits, I shall deal with that. Three quarters of those surveyed were satisfied with waiting times. The surveys show that only 3 per cent. wanted to complain. That is not a message of complacency. We are committed to improving the national health service, but it does no good for Opposition Members to make sweeping, generalised criticisms of the health service in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really must press on.<br><br>
I have been asked detailed questions about constituency matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North is a redoubtable constituency campaigner, and it was no surprise when he referred to the Meigle Cottage Hospital. As my hon. Friend said, the matter is about to go to judicial review, so discretion should be the better part of valour for me this morning.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Midlothian and for Leith referred to the Lothian acute services strategy. The hon. Member for Leith asked about the date for building the new hospital. We expect it will be in 1996. The hon. Member for Midlothian asked how much the capital cost of the strategy would be. Our estimate is £200 million from 1994.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray asked about single manning of ambulances in her constituency. Across Scotland, the incidence of single manning has fallen from 8.7 per cent. in 1991 to 1.75 per cent. in 1993–94. The target is to reduce that incidence to less than 1 per cent. as soon as practicable. The ambulance service has been asked to make that a priority, especially in those rural areas to which the hon. Lady referred, where the incidence is still high.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that the trust application for the ambulance service mentions single manning as a matter for the trust. As the matter has already enjoyed such remarkable improvement, why must we wait for trust status for it to be completed? It is a nonsense to refer to the matter at all in the trust application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The process has not yet been completed. That is the point. We have made substantial progress, but I agree with the hon. Member for Moray that further progress needs to be made, especially in rural areas. That is our priority.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Gordon and Aberdeen, North, and my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside, focused on another constituency matter, the Grampian Healthcare NHS trust. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North referred to the business plan, which was published on 30th March 1994. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside—one must start with a business plan when one confronts changes. Reference was also made to how Grampian Healthcare intends to proceed with the proposed closure of three hospitals and the relocation of all in-patient services currently provided at the City hospital in Aberdeen to the Aberdeen Royal infirmary.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside made the case about Woodlands when he said that it was operating well below capacity. It is proposed that services be transferred to the Ross clinic, where extensive refurbishment is under way to ensure the safety and privacy of residents. No final decisions have yet been taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may like to correct a slip of the tongue. He said that adaptations to the Ross clinic are under way. Clearly, they are not. Plans are constantly being changed. Parents, especially, should be consulted and have their fears assuaged. In my belief, that is not being done properly. It would be wrong for the health board to start a formal consultation process now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The health board has a statutory requirement to consult the general public. My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside referred also to the specific points made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North about consultation with parents I undertake to consider that.<br><br>
The acute beds strategy, in general, was referred to by several members of the Committee, including the hon. Members for Moray and for Maryhill. The reasons for the reduction in the number of acute beds is, first, because there are more day cases; secondly, there is more out-patient treatment and, thirdly, there are shorter lengths of stay.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Recent experience has shown an annual reduction of about 4.5 per cent. We are assuming that that trend will continue, but at a much lower rate—at about 2 per cent. per annum. As for a more efficient use of beds, I must say to Opposition Members who criticise the strategy that, on average, about one in three acute in-patient beds is empty at any one time. I assume that it is their strategy to have more empty beds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I must make progress. More empty beds is the logic of those who criticise the acute bed strategy. Taken together, existing trends point to a need for about 5,000 fewer acute beds by early next century. I can tell the hon. Member for Moray that we shall keep the matter under review, as trends can change.<br><br>
Opposition Members referred in several interventions and speeches to the number of doctors and nurses in relation to the number of managers. I shall give them the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave them to me in a parliamentary question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give them again. In 1979, there were 9,839 doctors in Scotland; in 1993, that figure increased to 11,265. That is a 14 per cent. increase. In nursing staff, there was an overall increase of 7.5 per cent. Of course, there was a decline in the nursing staff in relation to acute treatment hospital beds, because the number of such beds declined. Overall, however, the number of staff increased substantially. Those figures are absolutely clearcut and unequivocal. The key resource of the national health service is its skilled staff; it undermines the Government's commitment to the national health service in Scotland.<br><br>
I have not been able to cover several detailed constituency points, but I shall consider them and write to members of the Committee. I shall end the debate, as I started it by emphasising the Government's commitment to the national health service in Scotland in terms of resources and practical action.</span></p>
