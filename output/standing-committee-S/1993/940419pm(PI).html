<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before lunch, I was asking how it is envisaged that reporters will be deployed in the new administration, given the possibility of smaller authorities sharing reporters and larger authorities operating decentralisation schemes. How will existing close working relationships between reporter, panel and local authority be protected?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment concerns the proposal to allow the administration to site one authority's accommodation and facilities for children's hearings in the area of another authority, which simply reflects the discretion that current legislation allows to local authorities. We hope for similar levels of use to those under the current arrangements. I see no problem about authorities sharing reporters. That would be consistent with a continuity of arrangements—a common sense approach. It is crucial that children and their parents be allowed to continue to attend the same centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DIRECTIONS BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 345, in page 87, line 15, after "may", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with interested bodies, organisations and persons".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1898</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With that we may take Government amendment No. 817.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This straightforward amendment would simply ensure that the Secretary of State would have to consult
<br><blockquote><p>"interested bodies, organisations and persons"</p></blockquote>
before issuing directions to the Scottish children's reporter administration. I cannot for the life of me see that that would cost the Government anything. It would make sound sense. It would be perverse not to have such consultation before giving guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reporter administration is to be a non-departmental public body supported by grant and it would be accountable to the Secretary of State. Any directions issued by him would relate to the day-to-day running of the administration and would not impinge on the exercise of the reporter's statutory functions in relation to children and the hearings system.<br><br>
The matters to be covered in directions would largely relate to the working responsibilities of the administration, for which it would be accountable to the Secretary of State. Those do not seem appropriate objects for the widespread consultation set out in the amendment. The other amendment is technical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give up. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 817, in page 87, line 16, after "the", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"achievement of its general purpose and".—[<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have repeatedly stated that the independence from central Government control of the principal reporter's function will be maintained and that the Scottish children's reporter administration is to be a non-departmental public body to ensure that it is distanced from the direct influence of central Government. However, clause 128 will achieve the opposite, as it provides that the Secretary of State may, if he chooses, give specific or general directions to the administration and thus to the principal reporter who can be dismissed by that body.<br><br>
Like it or not, the principal reporter will be vulnerable in the new set up, as he must comply with directions. At the very least, the Minister should explain what directions are likely to be given to the administration and assure the Committee that the relevant organisations will be consulted before such directions are issued. Will the Minister give that assurance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We covered that point in our debate on the previous amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I reconfirm that the directions which may be issued by the Secretary of State would cover the day-to-day running of the administration and would not impinge upon the reporter's statutory functions. The clause is not controversial; it requires the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1899</span>
State's usual administrative powers of direction, which do not extend to directing the principal reporters in performing their statutory functions under the 1968 and 1975 Acts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the principal reporter not be vulnerable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear the last part of the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that the principal reporter will not be vulnerable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in my view. It is a strong position; the principal reporter's independence will be respected and is extremely important. Persons holding prominent positions should not be vulnerable unless something goes wrong. It is important that the right person is chosen.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TRANSFER OF STAFF, PROPERTY ETC. TO THE ADMINISTRATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister saw the recent article in <i>The Herald</i> about the report by Mr. Peggie, the new chairman of the staff commission, at the conference in Gleneagles of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. The subject was the transfer of staff to the administration and the report stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The chairman of the Staff Commission in Scotland yesterday criticised the Government's slowness in getting the local government body up and running."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Peggie said that it was unfortunate that the arrangements for redundancy and compensation were those that had been accepted in England and Wales. He thought that the redundancy and compensation terms might not be so relevant for Scotland. The report continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish Local Government Minister, Mr. Allan Stewart, previously said the names of the other members of the Scottish advisory committee, which will become the commission, would be made public by April 1"—</p></blockquote>
we are now well into April—
<br><blockquote><p>"It is now understood it will be another two weeks before they are announced."</p></blockquote>
As the advisory committee chairman said that it was important for the names to be announced, can the Minister say when the announcement will be made, even if he cannot tell us the names today? The article continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Peggie… also cast doubt on English and Welsh suggestions that 90 per cent. of the existing employees would transfer to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1900</span>
new councils. He believed this was an optimistic assessment for Scouand."</p></blockquote>
It may not be possible to deal with this matter in the limited context of the clause, but it would be helpful if the Committee could be informed at some point.<br><br>
Mr. Peggie's appointment was welcomed on both sides of the House. I was party to that welcome and continue to welcome the appointment. It would help the Committee if one of the Ministers could respond to the question of the number of staff transferring and supply the names of the members of the staff advisory committee or the future staff commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the hon. Gentleman if I confirm the names of a number of the staff commission members that I announced the following day at the conference. They were reported in the press but the hon. Gentleman must have missed them. I announced the following members' names: Professor Midwinter, Mr. Jim Weir, formerly of Strathclyde regional council, and Mrs. Charlotte Stenhouse. Those names are in addition to that of the chairman, Mr. Peggie. Additional names may be announced subsequently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I did not come across that announcement in the press. It is a pity that it was not reported more widely. As I said to one of my hon. Friends a few minutes ago, the Scottish press does not report much of what happens in Parliament. It is interested only in splits, attacks and confrontations. I hope that factual matters—even when they emanate from the Government—will be reported properly, although I exclude the <i>Daily Record</i> from what I have just said.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that, even though more members of the staff commission will be appointed, there is nothing to prevent the members already appointed from meeting to deal with some of the matters raised in the report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is envisaged that the Committee will be operational from 1 May.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, I am dismayed at the attitude of the Scottish press. I shall not mention any names, but just now in the Corridor a distinguished Lobby correspondent asked me what was happening. It did not seem to occur to him that he might have spent the morning listening to the debate on the important question of children's panels. I am not concerned about personal publicity, but the coverage of the issues raised in this Committee has done no credit to the Scottish press, which claims to be serious.<br><br>
The Minister appears to think that the lack of coverage is funny, but I think that he will reap the whirlwind. When people discover what has happened, matters will be very different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was amused because the hon. Gentleman seems to think that I am responsible for the press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not suggested in any way that the Government are responsible for the press. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1901</span>
appeared to be expressing glee at what I consider to be the press' dereliction of its journalistic duty. The criticism does not apply to politicians but to the Lobby journalists' inattention to their serious duties. They may have found it difficult to get their stories into their papers, but that is different. The coverage of the issues debated in this Committee has been abysmal.<br><br>
I hope that, in the process of gathering answers to the questions that have been posed, the Government will rethink the proposals and defer any plan to nationalise the reporter service until it can be considered properly in the context of a Bill to reform the overall arrangements for child care in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As well as the <i>Daily Record,</i> Grampian Television should also be excluded from criticism. Its coverage of the Committee has been excellent.<br><br>
The Minister said that he intends to make further appointments to the staff commission. He read out several names, but I did not hear him name anyone from Tayside or the north-east of Scotland. Does he intend to ensure that that part of Scotland will be represented on the staff commission by announcing an appointment from Tayside or at least from the north-east of Scotland?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the hon. Gentleman's remarks into account. No doubt if he has a specific recommendation he will submit it.<br><br>
The clause provides for the transfer of reporters and other related staff from local authority employment to employment by the new administration and for the transfer of property, rights, liabilities and obligations of reporters and local authorities to the principal reporter or to the new administration. The clause is sensible and well thought out. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>

<p>New clause 62—<i>Reporter's Service Charter</i>—</p>
<p>" 122.—In section 36 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (the Reporter), after sub-section (3) there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4) Each Reporter will produce a Charter relating to such issues as the Secretary of State may by order define, including statements of the standards of service and hearings accommodation which are to be provided, and implementing an effective complaints procedure to ensure these standards are met.'.".</p></blockquote></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"124.—In Schedule 3 to the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (Children's Panels), in paragraph 7, after 'Each local authority', for 'may' there shall be substituted 'shall'; and after 'panel members' there shall be inserted 'in accordance with such requirements as the Secretary of State may by order establish.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to reinforce the points made this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). We intend to discuss the children's panel system on Report because the matter was dealt with in the usual perfunctory way by Ministers. No reassurances were given about the crisis that will engulf children in Scotland as a result of the combination of factors mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.<br><br>
First, there will be no child care Bill. Such a Bill is essential because on such legislation Scotland drags behind England and Wales. Secondly, the interests of everyone in Scotland have been ridden over roughshod, and the Government want to break up a successful system of panel reporters. The statutory responsibilites for a director of a social work committee are to be abandoned.<br><br>
The Government could be charged with bringing the future of children in Scotland into grave doubt. The clause and the new clauses refer to reporting between the new, dynamic single-tier unitary councils which, through their social work departments, will have to advise the panels and the reporters of what is taking place. That said, the work between the new administration for the reporters, the social work committee—if there is to be one—and the councils becomes an important issue.<br><br>
The issues of a reporter's service charter, joint children's panels and children's panel training have been linked for the clause stand part debate. They are enormous issues, but we do not intend to develop them further this afternoon. Suffice it to say that we give the Government warning that when we raise these issues in the House, we shall want more than the half-baked responses that were made this morning.<br><br>
We want Scotland to be reassured that this crazy Bill will not create a crisis for our children under 16. We are dealing with nothing more nor less than their futures. It is astonishing—I pick my words carefully—for any Government in their right mind to cause such a major upheaval of the system when funding is under strain, social work provision is in doubt and no child care Bill has hit the statute book.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1903</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton this morning gave the Government the opportunity to release themselves from the hook that they are on. Why do not they undertake to re-examine part III and the first part of part IV and say that they will do nothing further to destroy the credibility of the system until a children Bill for Scotland is put before the House? We value the possibility of such a Bill and would try to help the Government to draw up a modern measure to cope with modern problems.<br><br>
We are moving toward a crisis. We do not intend to pursue the issues in clause 132, but we warn the Government that we hope to introduce later a package of measures. We hope also that that will be a matter for the House of Lords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not speak in detail to the new clauses, so I shall confine my remarks to clause 132. It empowers the principal reporter to request a report from the local authority when a case is first referred. The report can include information on the social background of the child being investigated and could contain information from any person which the principal reporter or the local authority deems worthwhile. The provision is designed to assist the principal reporter in any initial investigations which may lead to a referral to a hearing. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>

SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOLS: CERTAIN PROPOSALS UNDER EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1980</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 872, in page 89, line 46, after "school", insert "proposed for closure".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following Amendment No. 873, in page 90, line 6, after "school", insert "proposed for closure".<br><br>
Government amendments Nos. 684 to 686.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are complex issues in relation to schood closures. The clause has been the subject of discussion with the appropriate education authorities, particularly Strathclyde. As you are probably aware from your local knowledge, Mr. Martin, there have been difficulties in Strathclyde with school closures. It is hoped that the clause will assist the education authorities to deal more sensibly with such matters. We have tabled the amendment to try to improve the system. It is all about the rolling programmes for school closures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 133 can be described as the St. Gerard's clause because of the excellent campaign waged by the parents of pupils at St. Gerard's to defend the school in which they defeated all comers. Congratulations for that campaign are due particularly to the chair of the St. Gerard's school board, Deirdre Gaughan. I am sure that we all wish her good
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1904</span>
fortune in her efforts next month to become a gamekeeper, as distinct from a poacher, in the regional council elections.<br><br>
I understand why the provision has been introduced and I have some sympathy for the Government in that. Unfortunately, like the previous legislation, it is fundamentally flawed. There is a major omission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having watched my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) work so hard with the parents of St. Gerard's on the clause and on the clauses in the previous education legislation, and given that the Government do not listen to anything that we say about education, would not it be better for my hon. Friend not to tell the Government about the flaw and to keep it up his sleeve?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I do not see why I should bother telling the Government about the flaw in their legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Gentleman may not support the clause with enthusiasm, I had a deputation from Strathclyde regional council—the hon. Gentleman's successors in office there—which welcomed it.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 133 is to ensure that the triggering of a ballot on self-governing status at a school will block only proposals for closure of, or change to, the essential characteristics of that school. It will not block proposals for closure of, or change to, another school where the closure or change has indirect effect on the balloting school. The intention is to prevent the blocking of school rationalisation by a series of ballots at schools indirectly affected by a school closure.<br><br>
Clause 133, as drafted, provides for the Secretary of State to prescribe the sorts of proposals for change to a school which a ballot will block, such as proposals for closures and essential changes to characteristics. However, it is possible that clause 133, as drafted, does not make it sufficiently clear that it is only proposals to close or change the balloting school which will be blocked.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 684 to 686 make clear beyond all doubt that what is blocked is, first, a proposal to discontinue the balloting school and, secondly, a proposal to do such other things to the balloting school as the Secretary of State may prescribe. The amendments mention specifically the matter of discontinuance as it is that which has caused trouble in practice. The amendments thus clarify clause 133 without changing the intended policy. I commend them to the Committee.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 872 and 873 represent another way to achieve broadly the same end. The main difference is that they refer to the closure of a school rather than to its discontinuance. The word "discontinuance" is the technical term used for closure in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. On that basis, I suggest that amendments Nos. 872 and 873 are unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the scale of these matters? How many schools in Scotland are currently self-governing? How many additional requests are pending?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One school is self-governing and another one is being considered. Other

schools may well be forthcoming in due course. That is a matter for democratic decision. The legislation is in place. Schools will come forward as and when they consider it most appropriate for their own circumstances.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition do not wish to detain the Committee, but it is important to clarify some of the issues that arise under clauses 134, 135 and 136. In a nutshell, they can be described as the nationalisation clauses. It may seem odd for the Opposition to say that about clauses in a Bill presented by a Conservative Government, but the situation is ridiculous. By stealth, using technical clauses in a local government Bill, and unlike the present circumstances in which private legislation governs the activities of the Forth and Tay road bridges, the Government would have us believe that the ownership of those bridges would be safe in the Secretary of State's hands and would be better utilised in respect of Government cash.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For some time, I have been thinking about the misuse of the word "nationalisation". Many people have used it to describe what is happening. I seriously suggest that the only model to sufficiently describe this is a state capitalist model, not a nationalisation process as the Opposition may envisage it, but something that might be recognised by the people who used to run the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point, which I shall not pursue in detail. The Government are so obsessed with centralisation that they have moved to new political practices. We need a new language to describe them. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) made a valid point that could be the subject of an essay or a paper or an exposition of greater length than could be made in Committee while remaining in order.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
Nationalisation is a good description for' the Government's current practice. On every occasion for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1906</span>
nearly 15 years, the Government have attacked the centralised state, yet every clause of the Bill is riddled with more powers for the centre. The Government wish to remove the running of the two bridges from the boards and give it to the Secretary of State. We fundamentally oppose that. The provision does not constitute one step to nationalisation; it is a halfway house before the Government privatise the bridges.<br><br>
In Scotland, the Government are hell-bent on privatising the road network, and introducing tolls where possible. The two road bridges form key strategic issues. At present, private legislation governs what goes on, but the Government, in a public Bill, seek to change that.<br><br>
Clauses 134, 135 and 136 grant the Secretary of State powers to dismantle the joint boards. Has that been discussed with the joint boards, or with Fife, Tayside and Lothian regions? Has anyone been consulted about the clauses? The Scottish public and road users would be better served by the bridges continuing to be administered by joint bridge boards. The bridge boards are not perfect—I have often been in conflict with the bridge board that looks after the Forth bridge—but I should be happier if the bridge boards had some say about the bridges' future. I should not like the bridges to be handed over to the Secretary of State for him to do as he wishes, regardless of the cost to the Exchequer.<br><br>
The Government should be embarrassed. They are trying, once again, to remove something that is administered locally to give it to the centralised state. It is repugnant to listen to a Government who wax eloquent about choice, freedom, individualism and devolution when all their actions are contrary to their principles. I hope that the Minister will provide some idea of the Government's real intentions. Privatisation is the hallmark of their roads policy. They will do anything to promote that policy. The Opposition remain implacably opposed to the three clauses. I have spoken about clause 134. You will be pleased to hear, Mr. Martin, that I shall not repeat my comments when we consider clauses 135 and 136.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak with the full authority of a Member who represents the southern toll-collecting end of the Forth bridge.<br><br>
Clause 134 provides that bridges constructed under private legislation—for example, the Forth and Tay bridges—should be treated as if there was a public right of passage over them. At present, there are doubts about whether such a right exists in law. The public can cross the bridges only on payment of a toll, not as of right. Is that how the Scottish Office understands the law? The significance of this deceptively innocuous provision is that there will be no doubt that the bridges, being notionally acceptable to the public as a right, fall within the definition of a road in the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984. The significance of clause 134 does not, therefore, relate to the conferment of the public right as such. However, it is essential to the strategy underlying this and the next clause that there should be no ambiguity that the bridges are, in law, roads.<br><br>
As roads, bridges can be brought within the scope of a special road order. Special road orders are made under the Roads (Scotland) Act, and the most common examples of special roads are motorways, although any strategic route can be classified as a special road by either the Secretary of State or a local roads authority.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1907</span>
A special road order prescribes the route of a special road and authorises the appropriation of any existing road comprised in that route and the transfer of that road to the special roads authority. The promotion of such an order is subject to various statutory procedures for public notification and for dealing with objections.<br><br>
Since, by virtue of clause 134, the Forth bridge would be a road within the meaning of the 1984 Act, a special road order could be promoted under that Act, in terms that the Forth bridge would form part of a prescribed strategic route. It would be appropriated by and transferred to the Secretary of State. That is of consequence to those people who have to deal with the Forth road bridge. Therefore, I should like at least a statement from the Scottish Office on the point in law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To save time, it would probably be better to make a general speech covering all three clauses.<br><br>
I do not like the principle of toll bridges. I regard the Forth and the Tay bridges and other bridges in the United Kingdom as part of the national highway network. It is grossly discriminatory that people should have to pay tolls to go from some parts of the country to other parts.<br><br>
The clauses are paving legislation for the Government's plan to encourage the private sector to build a second Forth road crossing, irrespective of whether it is required. Exactly what toll do the Government have in mind for the second Forth bridge? Presumably they would have equal tolls on both bridges, otherwise there would be the most ludicrous competition. Since this is part of Government policy, it would be helpful if the Minister would take advantage of the debate to say how much travellers are likely to have to pay in future to cross the Forth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a former member of the joint board that looked after the Tay road bridge, I am concerned about its future. Throughout the debates the Minister has argued that things must change as a consequence of the move to single-tier authorities. At the moment, the joint board is staffed by Tayside and Fife regional councils, both of which will disappear.<br><br>
Fife regional council will remain as Fife council and Tayside regional council will be replaced by the new Dundee council, which will be a roads authority. Why is it impossible for the Dundee and Fife councils to continue to form a joint board to run the bridge, as they have done since the introduction of regional councils in 1975?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with three clauses, the first of which is the most straightforward. It is about the definition of a road, which is a technical matter. It ensures that a bridge constructed under private legislation, and to which the public has access, is classed as a road for the purpose of the Act. Any proposal to bring bridges under the control of the Secretary of State relates to their role in the national network.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that, in the past, different bridges have come under different schemes and legislation. The bridges that we are discussing are in the charge of joint boards. It is possible that the inclusion of those bridges within the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1908</span>
roads for which the Secretary of State is responsible would lead to consideration of the future role of the present joint boards that manage and operate the bridges. If such a change were to leave the boards without any function, their wind-up would be sensible but I do not think that the local authorities would cease to have an interest in the future of those vital finks.<br><br>
In the case of the Forth road bridge, if we decide to go ahead with the present proposal for a private concession to cover the existing bridge and the future bridge we shall require the future private sector concessionaire to have satisfactory consultative arrangements with local communities and interests throughout the planning, construction and operation. My officials have already had some exploratory discussions with authorities on this subject and they will speak to them again in more detail in future. Local authorities obviously have an important role to play throughout the planning and promotion of any scheme. I am grateful to them for the invaluable assistance that they have given Scottish Office officials and advisers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the Government's intention to privatise the Tay road bridge and end local authority involvement in its running?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I said that if more roads are to come under the Scottish Office suitable provisions must obviously be included into the Bill. They must be included in case it would be appropriate for a bridge to come under the remit of the Scottish Office, but, of course, we have not made any decisions in that connection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister intend to remove the bridges from their current legislative context and the joint bridge board ownership to central Government, which would be a permanent move? Or, does he intend at a later stage to have the bridges privatised? Questions like that demand a yes or no answer. An "if" response will mean that the Government are going headlong towards privatisation. They should have the guts to admit that to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Tay bridge is not in the same position as a possible future Forth bridge and there is no equivalent specific proposal relating to it at present. We are, however, examining its future position in the present review of the network As I made clear, we intend to consult on the outcome of that review in the autumn and if we propose taking the Tay bridge into the Secretary of State's network we shall set out clearly our proposals for the future of the joint board. That will include the future position of any board staff who might be affected by any such proposals. There is no proposal to privatise roads and bridges; they will remain in public ownership under the Secretary of State's control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as the Tay bridge is concerned, it sounds like another Tay bridge disaster. Can I ask the Minister about the Forth bridge. I understood him to say earlier that there will be a second Forth road bridge but I thought that there had not been a policy decision on that. I saw an interesting suggestion recently that the Kincardine bridge should be upgraded and improved as the alternative crossing of the Forth. Has a policy decision
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1909</span>
already been made about a second Forth road bridge? If so, it is a major decision that the Minister has announced en passant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. No decision has been made on that subject. Proposals have been put forward and the results of feasibility studies will be made public in due course. The "Setting Forth" consultation document considered a number of possible corridors for a new road crossing of the Forth. The work done in preparing that document led us to conclude that Kincardine and Queensferry should continue to be the focal points for further transport improvements. The issue of transferability between Kincardine and Queensferry is limited as the two bridges serve different journey patterns. That is an important issue and we are examining the options for improvement in the Kincardine area, in parallel with the feasibility study in "Setting Forth".<br><br>
There has been close co-operation between the two sets of studies to ensure that a complete view is taken of the options for improved transport links around the Firth of Forth. The results of both studies will be examined in conjunction, and decisions on "Setting Forth" will take careful account of the findings of the work at Kincardine. We are nowhere near a decision on this. The results of the feasibility study will be made available in due course.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister confirms that no decision has been taken. Many of us were worried, by implication, that he had rushed into taking a decision on the second Forth road bridge.<br><br>
The Minister should consider other travel patterns. I understand that there is a pattern from Lothian to Fife across the Forth bridge, which is different from that using the Kincardine bridge. There are two options from which to choose when the route is from Ayr to Start's Park or East End Park. One is to use the M8 via the Forth road bridge, while the other is to use the M9 or M80 and go over the Kincardine bridge. The Minister should take account of patterns of movement other than the commuting patterns from Lothian to Fife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will see, when the results of the feasibility studies are made public, that all relevant factors have been considered in greater detail. A package of measures has been considered, and nearly 50 per cent. of those measures relate to possibilities other than a bridge.<br><br>
Any bridge and road proposals would be subject to a full statutory public inquiry under the roads legislation in due course. Such an inquiry is extremely probable, given all the precedents that there have been, and the normal statutory procedures would be followed if the Secretary of State were minded to take that line.<br><br>
I could speak further at great length, but I think that I have covered the main points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I addressed a specific question to the Minister on his view of the future toll charge for crossing the bridge or bridges. That is crucial to people throughout Scotland, not only to those in Lothian, Fife and Tayside.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1910</span>
The Minister has said that there are no plans to privatise the existing Forth road bridge, and I suppose that we should be thankful for that. It is abundantly clear, however, that the Government are thinking of encouraging the private sector to build a second Forth road bridge. What level of toll would have to be charged to make that job worth while for any private consortium? The tolls on the two bridges would have to be the same, so the first bridge would become a very nice little earner for the Scottish Office.<br><br>
The Minister and his officials must know from their preliminary discussions with those in the private sector who might be interested in building a bridge what level of toll would be required. It would be helpful if he would come clean on this. At present, it costs 40p to take a car across the Forth bridge. What would it cost to use a bridge operated by the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the future ownership of the Tay road bridge is under review in the Scottish Office and that a decision is likely to be made in the autumn. Will he be more specific about when that decision will be made?<br><br>
It was also clear from the Minister's remarks that the decision will not be for the ownership of the Tay road bridge to be retained by the local authorities at either end of it; instead, the bridge will initially pass to the ownership of the Secretary of State for Scotland. I cannot believe that the Secretary of State, who has been running around the country and telling everyone that he wants to devolve power and decision making down to the local level, is really interested in collecting the tolls on the Tay road bridge rather than letting local authorities do it. I must therefore assume that there is an ulterior motive for the Secretary of State to take over the ownership of the Tay road bridge. That can only be that somewhere down the line, the Minister and his cronies intend to bring in private concessionaires, as they call them, to run the road system in our country and to charge tolls for using the roads. That will include charging people to use the road bridges.<br><br>
Such decisions, which are currently taken at local level, will in future be taken not by the Secretary of State but by private concessionaires, who will no doubt use market forces to ensure that everyone pays a great deal more than the current cost of 40p to cross a bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes a lot of nonsense comes from Opposition Members. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said the costs of one bridge would have to equate with costs of the other. I remind the Committee of the words of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley who spoke about alternative routes and referred to Kincardine bridge and the Forth road bridge. The Forth bridge has a 40p charge; Kincardine bridge is free to cross. That example negates the argument from his hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, because there is no charge on the latter bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looked at a map of Scotland he would see that Kincardine bridge is some distance from the Forth bridge. The great distance involved is why drivers find it worthwhile to go across the Forth bridge. The hon. Gentleman should compare like with like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of the distance between the Forth road bridge and the Kincardine bridge. I lived in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1911</span>
Dunfermline and in Kincardine, both of which I know well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has confirmed, has he not, that, in law, the bridges are designated roads, the whole question of whether there should be tolls comes into play. Leaving aside tolls, the Minister also mentioned public consultation. What consultation has he in mind on Queensferry? A brave Minister would not send his officials to consultations, he would go to Queensferry himself. If he did, he would find few friends of a second bridge in that area. There is one argument only for a second road bridge, which would apply only if the original bridge was thought structurally or metallurgically unsound. I have been assured many times that that is not so. I ask the Minister to come to Queensferry, which he hopes to represent again one day, and discover from a public meeting what people think about this preposterous proposal from the Scottish Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely worried by the Government intentions for road crossings. Can the Minister give me a categoric assurance that he does not intend to introduce tolls on, or privatise, either the Kingston bridge or the Clyde tunnel at any time? We need an assurance, binding on the Government, that they do not intend to privatise those priceless assets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate could continue for many hours. Some important points were highlighted, but the key issue is that this set of three shabby clauses will alter the public perception of the Scottish road network and allow the Secretary of State to do what he wishes. It is difficult to impress on Conservative Members that those clauses represent centralisation. They give the Secretary of State powers to do as he wishes with the two key bridges. My hon. Friend the Member for Govan has questioned what might happen to others.<br><br>
Perhaps I am the only member of the Committee who lives in a region where one has to pay to enter the south of it and pay to enter the north. We have temporarily scrapped the payment to leave the north but must pay to get back in. The tolls are a tremendous burden on the people of Fife and its business community. What is even worse is the massive uncertainty that surrounds a Government who are hell-bent on playing politics with the bridges rather than seeking the best way forward with transit networks in and out of Fife, through Lothian and Tayside.<br><br>
It is clear from the Minister's answers that the Government want to privatise as much of the road network as they can. The same applies with water. No matter what they say, everything leads back to the Government wishing to take to the centre and put everything into the marketplace, the private sector, as early as possible. We warn the Government again that people in Fife, Lothian and throughout Scotland will not want to pay tolls of £3 or £4 to make a crossing.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), who never asks brilliant questions, asked how one bridge could influence another. It is obvious that if there were two bridges on the Forth, people would not have to pay £3 on one route to enter Fife and 40p on the other route to leave Fife. That defies the logic of common sense—a quality not in abundance on the Government Benches.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1912</span>
The Government should come clean and admit that these three clauses are about privatisation. We are to have a second Forth road bridge and we are setting up a public inquiry to provide a public interest veneer. The joint boards will be scrapped and the Government, with their heavy-handed approach, will take over. The Minister, no matter what he has said and is about to say, will not reassure us that this is nothing other than a highly politicised agenda that is more in the interests of Government policy than the people who we represent. We intend to vote against the three clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister would answer the question about consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to do so. I thought that the hon. Gentleman had another point to raise.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about the date of the decision. It will be autumn, as for the other proposals. We have made no decisions; we are examining the matter of the Tay bridge and the relevant factor is the role that it plays in the network.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian asked about the toll. The toll income from both bridges would go to a concessionaire, but ownership of both bridges would rest with the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What will the tolls be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State were minded to proceed and the development went ahead, tolls on both Forth bridges would be subject to a ceiling set out in the Secretary of State's toll order. That is many years down the track; to build another bridge would take at least eight and a half years and might take longer than that because it would be subject to a public inquiry.<br><br>
The present toll for cars is 40p. I am aware of the extravagant claims that the toll will be £5 or £6: I do not know on what basis such a calculation has been made because it is totally unrealistic. The opportunity for a company to charge over the odds would not exist, and the Secretary of State would not allow that to happen. I am confident that eventual tolls will represent good value for money.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) referred to the views of those people who live in south Queensferry. Significant national as well as local issues are involved. If the Secretary of State were minded to proceed, the statutory process would enable those concerns to be fully explored. Scottish Office officials have met the residents of Queensferry several times already.<br><br>
I should state that estuarial crossings, such as the Forth road bridge at Queensferry, provide significant benefits for users in the form of reduced distances and journey times. It has been a policy of successive Governments that those who make use of such specialised infrastructure should pay directly towards the benefits that they receive.<br><br>
As to the package of transport measures, as I mentioned, we intend to publish the findings of the feasibility studies. If it is decided to go ahead with the proposals, they will be subject to the usual statutory procedures and it is extremely likely that a wide-ranging public inquiry will be held. No planning permission
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1913</span>
inquiry has ever been instituted in Scotland and the usual statutory procedures would be adopted.<br><br>
Were the Secretary of State to be minded to proceed, it is likely that a core of 2,000 employees would be required on site over a construction period of five years with the prospect of additional spin-off work elsewhere. Before hon. Members leap to conclusions about this matter, I remind the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) of what his regional council in Fife wrote at the end of its document "The Case for a New Forth Road Bridge". It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Fife Regional Council believes that, without a new road crossing, the noose at the Forth estuary will tighten, cutting off the life blood of Fife, the North and North East of Scotland."</p></blockquote>
It would be wrong for the Committee to form a final judgment on a possible second Forth road bridge before we have all the evidence. That evidence will be made public in due course when the feasibility studies are made available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not it astonishing that the Minister can tell the Committee how many employees would be taken on and how much the bridge would cost—as well as many other details—when he claims that no decision has been taken about it? Earlier, when we asked about the qualifications needed by the principal reporter, he could not tell us. Is not that an astonishing state of affairs?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deny that he intends to privatise the Kingston bridge and the Clyde tunnel? He declined to deny it earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not cover that circumstance. I have no proposals for either of those projects. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to table an appropriate amendment, the Committee may consider it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will not say it again: if there is movement when a Question is being put, those involved will be made to leave the Committee Room. It is as simple as that. I ask the Minister to tell his officials to carry out the wishes of the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the anxiety that the Secretary of State will seek to erect emergency signs on many local authority roads. That is not the intention of the clause. At present the power to erect emergency signs, under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, is available only to the police and those acting under their instruction. That has worked well in general, but it means that a police presence is required in any motorway traffic control room.<br><br>
The intention of the clause is to permit the Secretary of State to operate a matrix gantry signal system on and in relation to trunk roads, including emergency signs such as lane closures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman approaches the Forth Bridge on the north side, he will see large gantry signs that flash up details.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to know if the Minister knew.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that hon. Members are playing their part in keeping Ministers up to the mark.<br><br>
Some matrix signs will be necessary on the approach to trunk roads to make certain that traffic can be prevented from entering the trunk road when necessary in an emergency. It is only those approach signs that will be erected on local roads. Given that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</span></p>

EXCLUSION FROM VALUATION ROLL OF SPORTING RIGHTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 355, in page 92, line 8, after "fishings", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"which are accessible for use by members of the public at a reasonable charge.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 679, in page 92, line 8, after "fishings", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and any weir or channel operated by or on behalf of a District Salmon Fishery Board for the purpose of counting fish.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every piece of Scottish legislation that comes before the House includes a clause that is a backhander to the landowning lobby. In that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1916</span>
sense, it is appropriate that I should speak about the amendments to this clause.<br><br>
Last week we discussed the clause to create the special new law of trespass in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill to enable Scottish landowners to throw off then land perfectly legitimate hill walkers. Clause 138 of this Bill derates sporting rights in Scotland—a £2 million backhander to the owners of grouse moors, deer forests and salmon fishing beats.<br><br>
I must declare an interest. Having checked some facts and figures last week, I pay the Borders regional council about £100 a year for shooting rates on land that is not shot over. I do not want that backhander. I do not mind paying and do not see why I should not pay. What is more, I do not see why a great many others in other parts of Scotland should not pay for the benefits and commercial interests that they possess.<br><br>
It is worth putting the provision in historical perspective, which will be particularly interesting to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire because the legislation that we are about to repeal was enacted under a Liberal Government. Schedule 14 provides for the repeal of Sporting Lands Rating (Scotland) Act 1886.<br><br>
I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), who takes a special interest in such matters and has looked up the <i>Hansard</i> report for 1 March 1886. Less than a column of <i>Hansard</i> was devoted to a Bill which had all-party support. Dr. Cameron, the Land League Member for the Wick Boroughs, explained that the Bill's
<br><blockquote><p>"object is to carry out the recommendations of the Select Committee of the House which reported in 1874".</p></blockquote>
The then Lord Advocate, the Liberal, Mr. J. B. Balfour, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the part of the Government I assent to the second reading of this Bill. It seems quite right in principle".</p></blockquote>
There is no escaping Robertsons in Committees because on behalf of the Conservative Opposition, Mr. J. P. B. Robertson said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The measure is founded on a just view of the propriety of the Valuation Roll setting forth one of the qualities of values of land in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
He continued;
<br><blockquote><p>"I desire to say for myself that it is wholly right that now, when the sporting value of land is a very material element in the actual value, as a matter of commerce, of land in Scotland, that that should appear in a question of rating."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 1 March 1886; Vol. 302; <i>c.</i> 147-148.]</p></blockquote>
The motion was agreed to without dissent. Ever since, rates have been payable on the value of sporting rights in Scotland.<br><br>
It would seem that that was just then. The only thing that is inappropriate now is that there is a distinction between Scotland and England. South of the border no rates are payable in respect of sporting assets. It has been said with some justification that that is discriminatory.<br><br>
There are two ways of setting the discrimination to rights. First, and perhaps most appropriate, would be to impose equivalent sporting rates on such interests south of the border, but the Government could not be expected to do any such thing. On the contrary, they are offering a nice little earner to their landowning friends north of the border and proposing to do away with rates on sporting assets in Scotland.<br><br>
A straight cash hand-out is being made to the shooting and fishing proprietors of Scotland, who have such rights
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1917</span>
for their enjoyment and for the profits that can be gained from ownership of them.<br><br>
If the Government want to give such a cash benefit to such people, they should at least ensure that the public derive benefit from this significant concession. The amendment would require the proprietors of sporting rights who take advantage of derating to grant reasonable public access to them.<br><br>
The owner of a salmon fishing beat which is subject to rating at present would have to allow scope for members of the public, tourists, visitors or local residents to buy a ticket to gain access to the fishing, as well as the Duke of wherever or prosperous visitors, if the interest was to be derated.<br><br>
That is one compromise, but there is a second consideration that was put to the Committee by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, unfortunately just too late for the tabling of an amendment. I submit it for the Minister's consideration. The society suggested that a conservation management condition should be applied to the granting of the derating—that £2 million backhander.<br><br>
The suggestion is that if, for example, the proprietor of a grouse moor is to have the advantage of such substantial tax relief, a requirement should at least be introduced for the grouse moor to be managed in the interests of conservation. It would be adding insult to injury to give that cash benefit to the proprietor of a grouse moor if, at the same time, the keepers were going around shooting protected species as birds of prey. That constructive suggestion could be considered by the Minister.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
We are entitled to ask why the Government are giving a £2 million backhander to the landowners of Scotland. Is it just a backhander to their friends, or is it in some way useful to the Scottish rural economy? I am again indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North, who has been making inquiries about the effect of the measures on the Scottish economy. He asked the Secretary of State on 28 March for an estimate
<br><blockquote><p>"On a per acre basis, of the yield to the Scottish economy from sporting estates."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, answered:
<br><blockquote><p>"My right hon. Friend does not collect this information."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North asked the Secretary of State for
<br><blockquote><p>"his latest estimate of the acreage of Scotland under <i>(a)</i> deer forest and <i>(b)</i> grouse moors."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"My right hon. Friend does not collect this information."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 March 1994; Vol. 240, <i>c.</i> 549.]</p></blockquote>
The Government have not a clue what benefit that industry may contribute to the Scottish economy, but they are still quite cheerfully giving a significant cash handout to its proprietors. The Government do not have the necessary information but in recent years they have been colluding with members of the same lobby—viciously, it is my contention—in relation, for example, to salmon fisheries. They have colluded with the so-called Atlantic salmon conservation trust to close down netting interests—destroying jobs on the lower
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1918</span>
reaches of several rivers, substantially increasing the value of rod fishing beats up the rivers and the income of their proprietors. Now another bonus is being given to those proprietors through the derating. Netting jobs have been destroyed and value has been added to the rod beats that are exclusively available to very prosperous people, who are now being given even more money.<br><br>
It is worth remembering that powers accorded to those rod fishing riparian owners will enable them to call on the police—paid for partly through local government finance—to enforce their rights. They will obtain from the police a service for which they will not be paying a contribution. The measure is a shameless subsidy to the Government's friends in the landowning fraternity. It is shamefully inappropriate as an amendment to the law of Scotland. I look forward to the day when a Labour Government will establish a Scottish Parliament, which will in due course set up a Scottish Anglers trust to ensure that such important assets of the rural community are managed and used in that community's interest and in that of the people of Scotland, rather than in the interests of a narrow group of privileged people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to speak to amendment No. 679, in my name and that of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) who fishes, I believe, as a hobby.<br><br>
My constituency, as my hon. Friends on the Front Bench will know, relies heavily on tourism and sporting activities. They will also know that fishing has gone through difficult times recently. Salmon stocks and catch have decreased significantly. A debate about the reasons for that has taken place. Research has been carried out, with the assistance of the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department, on the movement of fish up and down rivers. The Scottish Office monitors and controls fish counters on the North Esk, which is in my constituency, on the Westwater, in Banochry-Devenick on the Dee, and also in the Isle of Lewis. Rates are charged on fish counters, which are electrodes that are placed on weirs.<br><br>
I have corresponded for some months, with my hon. Friends the Ministers on that subject to try to have the fish counters derated because the costs are high to the salmon fishery boards, especially when they should spend all that they can on stock enhancement, in the best interest of the economy of the area. It has been argued that there is no reason to derate salmon counters in Scotland because rating occurs south of the border. Counters south of the border tend to be installed in existing or newly-constructed weirs, which are also used as gauging stations to measure river flow. South of the border, such structures are not subject to local authority rates. There is no provision in Scotland for exemption from rates for weirs at gauging stations. Scottish rivers are being hit by rating. It was suggested that the salmon fishery board should have appealed to the regional assessor against the valuation of the new fish counter at Banochry-Devenick. The salmon fishery board, however, believes that there was no case for an appeal under existing rules. On behalf of not only those who fish, but everyone who gains from the by-products of fishing and tourism in my constituency, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to re-examine the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is probably unaware that I served on the Forth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1919</span>
salmon fisheries board for six years. I am not familiar with the picture that he paints. One of the biggest problems that every angler faces upriver in Scotland is commercial netting and heavy use of the traditional Scottish net and cobble fishing method by commercial fishers. Those methods destock the rivers, especially the Tay and the Spey. If fish stocks increased, people would be able to pay the rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has expressed one view, but others believe that we should take account of fish-eating birds such as the goosander. The fish must be monitored up and down river, so that proper research can be carried out into the movement of salmon in Scottish rivers.<br><br>
I do not believe that we are in line with places south of the border. I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Minister to reconsider the matter and to present an amendment on Report, which would ensure that there was no prejudice against counters in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian, who spoke from the dizzy heights and delights of the sort of life that he leads, fails to appreciate the importance of salmon fishing to gillies and others who work on the river. The income that communities receive from fishing and sporting rights is equally important, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries knows. This part of the Bill is largely due to his constructive efforts in respect of sports, especially salmon fishing. It is because he understands the problems that we are beginning to find solutions. Those of us who have campaigned for more than 15 years to have the ghastly anomaly of rates on sporting areas in Scotland removed welcome my hon. Friend's contribution to the debate. I place on record my thanks and that of my constituents for his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support my hon. Friend's initiative to abolish the iniquitous sporting rates. I am sorry that the hon. Member for East Lothian, for all his lordly acres, does not understand conservation. Today he manifested a complete ignorance of the subject. The brief sent to him by the RSPB stated clearly that it supported the clause. The hon. Gentleman should have taken the trouble to read it. The RSPB believes, rightly, that sporting rates are an attack on conservation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think it a strange irony that on the day that value added tax on fuel for poor people will rise to 17.5 per cent., the Government are giving away £2 million to those who are already well off?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me for half a minute, I shall explain why the proposal is important. The estimate is not £2 million but between £3 and £5 million, which reinforces my case. The reason for the RSPB's anxiety about sporting rates is that they take away money that could be spent on the management of grouse moors. The Scottish grouse moors are declining in quality—that is what Labour Members want—because the income from grouse shooting has diminished and consequently estates—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wait a mo! Let my get my hanky out.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1920</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is not interested in the conservation argument, his party should be. It is important for Scotland's wild life and for employment in rural areas. The hon Gentleman may not care about that but some people do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know to whom the hon. Gentleman has been talking in the Scottish grouse moor shooting fraternity. I have personal knowledge of Mr. Wilson Young who, until he was sacked by those who took over Falkirk football club, made so much money from running shooting parties to the borders of Scotland that he could invest a substantial sum and reinvest the interest from it in Falkirk football club. The hon. Gentleman is peddling a mythology; money is being made by people who exploit the grouse moors and are quite capable of paying rates for their sport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely disagree with the hon. Gentleman. The RSPB is often in conflict with the owners of grouse moors, but its brief states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If, for example, grouse moor management is too expensive in relation to sporting income, it may be reduced … Eventually, such financial pressures can lead to a total switch in land use from grouse moor … to sheep-walk or forestry".</p></blockquote>
Both of those lead to a decline not only in grouse but in other rare bird species. That is why the RSPB is in favour of the removal of the sporting tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with me that it is extraordinary that hon. Members such as the Members for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and for East Lothian complain about the proposal when they spend so much of their time chuntering, whining and groaning about Essex man or his Scottish equivalent in the Conservative party Aberdeen, South man?<br><br>
Is not it extraordinary that when the Government introduces a measure such as this, which is designed to encourage the opposite of Essex man—the return to the grouse moor type of Conservative such as Douglas-Home and Macmillan about whom we are nostalgic—Labour Members spend so much time whining, chuntering and groaning? I am sure that they, too, are equally nostalgic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend because fishing and shooting are enjoyed by many different social groups, with different incomes and backgrounds, in Scotland.<br><br>
On the fishing question, one rod salmon caught is worth several hundred pounds to the local tourist trade. Fishermen pay £30 million each year for permission to fish in Scotland. The economics of towns such as Kelso would be seriously damaged if fishermen failed to pay the market price to fish. The livelihoods of people who live and work in rural areas—not those with jobs as estuarial netsmen or netsmen off the Northumbrian coast—would be seriously damaged if that fishing did not produce income.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the connection with derating is related to what people do on the land. As the clause is all about shooting, it occurred to me that junior and senior football clubs, from Bo'ness United, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1921</span>
Linlithgow Rovers right through to Celtic and Rangers, pay substantial rates. Should not the Government introduce an amendment to derate them? A lot of shooting takes place in those teams.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make it clear that I support the amendment. We should tell landowners that they have a duty to allow access to the public in all reasonable circumstances. I hope that the Government and the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, who, in fairness, spends half his time trying to promote that idea thoughout Scotland, will try to ensure that access is available. Although I support the amendment, I make it clear that I do so according to its terms. I support what the Government are doing about exemption for shooting rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that under the Salmon Act 1986 fishing rates are now payable only where there is no district salmon fishery board? I understand that almost all Scotland's principal salmon rivers are governed by district salmon fishery boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. My constituency experience differs from that of other Opposition Members in terms of the principle behind the Government's move to abolish the rates. Some of these landowners are farmers. If we want them to try to do something sensible about the common agricultural policy and its long-term reform, we must encourage them to diversify.<br><br>
It may be true that in some parts of the country, including parts of the Borders, there are abuses. Some landowners may take the money and run, and spend it on caviar and champagne. That is a matter for them. Those to whom I speak make a cogent case for sensible redevelopment of their own resources relative to employment, tourism and Kelso's economy. Pre-eminent businesses such as the Ednam House hotel in Kelso would not be able to stay open all year were it not for the boost that it gets from the salmon fishery.<br><br>
These are important matters. Class-based issue exist, and I do not dissent from the right of people to raise these issues because they are emotive, especially in parts of the Highlands. That certainly applies in south-east Scotland. However, the argument has moved on. The Government are right to recognise the needs of businesses that provide sporting faculties for those who enjoy them. I do not follow such pursuits, but the Government are right to move in that direction. I hope that they will also accept that they have a duty to make it clear to those who receive this substantial benefit, which is what it undoubtedly is, that they, in turn, have a duty to provide access for the public at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire mentioned the Ednam House hotel, which is doing well at the moment. That is the point. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) said, somewhat tongue in cheek, that I should be concerned about rural areas. I remind him that I represent a large rural area and I am concerned. But if £3 million or £5 million is currently available, as the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) said earlier, is that really the first priority of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire? Does he really want to give away such sums to the landowners who own the grouse moors and

the shooting and fishing rights and the deer forests? Would he not prefer to see that money used to put seat belts into school minibuses, to take a completely random example. That would cost the same. We are talking about priorities and those people do not need the money at the moment. I appeal to the hon. Member to consider his priorities.<br><br>
The priorities shown today have been extremely revealing. We spent all morning and part of the afternoon talking about children's panels. We talked about children at risk and young offenders and the problems in Scottish society today. They are crucial, heart-breaking problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lords Commissioner to the Treasury (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh my God!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, oh my God. We heard almost nothing from Conservative Back Benchers. As soon as we start to discuss handing out money to the landowners up they get, one after another with briefs from the Scottish Landowners Federation protesting and seeking to preserve their interests. That is an indictment of Conservative Members that I will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very predictable debate. About the only point that the hon. Member for East Lothian got right was that it all stemmed from the 1886 Act. There have been some commendable speeches from Conservative Members demonstrating the good reasons why we should make changes here and bring Scottish practice into line with England and Wales. I am amazed that Opposition Members should want Scotland to be at a disadvantage to England and Wales, particularly in view of the tremendous importance of sporting interests in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the 1990s and the next century as highlighted by, among others, my hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Hexham.<br><br>
Sporting interests are extremely important for tourism, the development of hotels and shops, providing employment and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are about three conversations going in the Committee Room. It is only courtesy to listen to any hon. Member who is addressing the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is also the important issue of the environment. If Opposition Members would only understand rather than criticise those who own grouse moors, they would recognise that they have an important role to play in developing the environment. The hon. Member for East Lothian of all people should surely realise that if we did not have grouse on the moors—and there are few at present—the heather would rapidly disappear under a vast increase in sheep and cattle numbers or, worse still, in forestry. One of the most attractive scenic regions for people coming to Scotland to see heather would no longer be there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may say no but he should realise that the disappearance of heather in Scotland has been extensive over the last 50 years.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1923</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is because of overgrazing of sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. But the hon. Gentleman should also know that under the common agricultural policy the object is to reduce the pressure of grazing sheep on the hills for environmental reasons. It is important therefore to look after the environment, which includes looking after grouse moors, deer forests and the countryside generally to achieve that objective.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian knows that this issue has gone on for many years. I moved amendments from the Back Benches in the 1980s which were lost only by the casting vote of the Chairman, my late pair Mr. Ian Campbell, who made the right decision because he had to keep the Bill as it was. It showed that, even then, I had support from the Labour party about removing sporting rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may shake his head, but if he takes the trouble to look at <i>Hansard,</i> he will realise that that was the case. We had a majority of four in Committee, and we got it down to a casting vote, because I had support from Opposition Members.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman talks as if he knows everything about this, but obviously he does not. During consideration of the Salmon Act 1986, we debated in great detail the matter of the north-east drift net off the Northumberland coast, which had such a damaging effect on fishing in Scotland. We discussed how important it was to restrict that drift net to develop aspects of the economy in the major river basins in Scotland.<br><br>
During consideration of the 1986 Act in another place, it was decided that the salmon rates would no longer be payable if a district salmon board were to make charges instead. That has been a tremendous help in establishing more salmon and trout in our rivers.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) said, only 10 per cent. of the salmon rivers in Scotland are not covered by the 1986 Act. So there is a very small precentage loss of income. However, that 10 per cent. is not lost to the local authority. Added to the non-domestic rate, as we propose, the sum would be swallowed up under the aggregate external finance and the revenue support grant. There would be no loss to the local authority. Indeed, that sum would be covered by the Exchequer. I have said, how important it is for the rural economy to include the clause in the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 355 would put the assessor in a difficult position, because he would have to decide what was a reasonable charge. That would lead to great diversity, which would go against the policy of the clause—to equate the position in Scotland as nearly as possible with that in England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I tempt the Minister to venture his own opinion about whether landowners should make access available? The technical effect of the amendment is one thing, but surely the principle is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is remarkable how much of Scotland's rivers are available to fishermen on a daily or weekly basis. There are any number of salmon rivers in Scotland where one can buy a day ticket for £3 or £5. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1924</span>
is the case very near my home. I am sure that that is possible on the Teviot above Hawick, where I did a lot of boyhood fishing, with a great lack of success.<br><br>
I should like as many daily and weekly tickets as possible to be available. A great deal of fishing is available in Scotland at reasonable rates. There is often exaggeration about people having to pay vast sums to catch fish in Scotland. That is not the impression that we want to give, because it is not true. We want more and more people to come to Scotland to enjoy our fishing and recreation, and to fish in our lochs as well as our rivers and seas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the price tag attached to this? Is the Minister saying that there will be no cost in lost revenue to local authorities? How does he square the rates holiday policy with the Government's policy of hammering timeshare owners with commercial rates?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a red herring if ever there was one. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not listening when I explained that this is a non-domestic rate and is therefore covered by the aggregate external finance. It comes from the Exchequer in the envelope of the revenue support grant, and is not a loss to the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are sporting rights entered in the valuation role? Perhaps I should be clear on that point, but I am not.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes they are, but they will no longer be after the passage of the Bill, if it becomes an Act. The fish counter is an important point, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside and by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) because of his interest in the Dee. I find the issue particularly hard to resolve because it is one of two fish counters—the other is owned by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland and therefore does not pay rates. Therefore, the only counter that pays rates is the one on the Dee.<br><br>
The difficulty is that I am forming a proposal to equate the position in Scotland with that in England and Wales. If I change the counter, legally I am making a difference in favour of Scotland. I am reluctant to do that in principle, but I appreciate that, because of the National Rivers Authority and the use of counters for environmental reasons, there is a further aspect that I should study. Without any commitment at all, I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside and to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North that I shall study the matter again before Report and let them know in good time whether it is possible to reconsider it for, not the first or second time, but at least the third time. I want to be absolutely fair. I ask them not to press the amendment to a Division or to vote against the stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his consideration, would the Minister also reflect on the view of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which wants clause 138 amended to exclude from the roll all but let sportings that are let separately from the land, as is the position in England?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1925</span>
That would restrict the erosion of the rating base, which arises from the removal of subjects from liability for rates and limits the increased burdens on the ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not reading out a document from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It may be easier for the hon. Gentleman, but it is not very easy for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had great difficulty in hearing the hon. Gentleman because of the other conversations in the Room. If he would prefer not to repeat it, I shall certainly write to him as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be better still to have a discussion with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors through officials.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before concluding, it would be helpful if the Minister could respond to two specific questions. First, the issue of the price tag has been raised by several hon. Members. Before we started the debate, I understood that the value of the concession was about £2 million. The hon. Member for Hexham, who seems to be close to such facts, said that it might be as much as £5 million a year. Will the Minister clarify that? Secondly, why on earth is he making it unconditional? There may be a case for derating such properties, but surely there should be a case for either environmental or public access conditions being applied to the concession. What is it worth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have discussed it with the Department, and the figure that I have is £2 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. If the hon. Member for Hexham knows more about those things—who knows, he might—it would be interesting to hear his comments. Either way, it is a considerable amount of money.<br><br>
The Minister has gone back over the notorious Salmon Act 1986, which I remember well because I was also on that Committee. There was a great deal of mythology peddled at the time and we have had some more of it now. I remember that at the time it was said that if steps were taken to close down various netting interests, it would result in a massive increase in the number offish going up the rivers, with more jobs being created in the netting fraternity. As far as I know, there has been no evidence of that happening.<br><br>
In many respects it has been an interesting debate. We have heard from Conservative Members from whom we have not heard for a long time. Hon. Members who have stayed absolutely silent on many other important issues have been rattled into expressing strong views. Among them were the hon. Member for Hexham, and even the hon. Member for Blackpool, North. I always thought of the latter as more of a pleasure beach man than a salmon fisherman, but now we know. We have also had the wonderful experience of hearing the representative of the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, supporting the repeal of a law enacted under a Liberal Government. There are few opportunities to do that. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside spoke in support of an amendment proposed originally by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North, who made it clear to me that he opposes the principle of the clause.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1926</span>
If the clause is to go through, my hon. Friend is keen that it should extend to that solitary fish counter. I am glad that the Minister will consider that point further.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, the proprietors of Scottish sporting interests would come a long way down the list of all the people on the globe who should benefit from a cash handout which might amount to £2 million according to the ministerial analysis, or £5 million according to the Hexham analysis. The Minister said that Scotland is currently at a disadvantage to England because of the discriminatory effect of legislation north and south of the border. Another way around that problem would be to ensure that sporting proprietors south of the border paid their fair whack towards local budgets. That is what their counterparts north of the border are required to do.<br><br>
The Minister said that the heather would disappear from the Scottish moors if this significant concession were not granted. That was how he sought to prove his case. But the overwhelming argument must be for the application of two types of condition. Environmental conditions involving land management should apply to the concession, and, more importantly, so should access conditions. It would be monstrous to give the Duke of Roxburgh, for example, such a handout without requiring him to give reasonable public access to those rights.<br><br>
For those reasons, I urge the Committee to support amendment No. 355. If that amendment is not accepted, I hope that the Committee will vote against the clause.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears from clause 140 that the Government intend to make provision by regulation for a variety of non-domestic rate poundages to be applied to different classes of lands. Arbitrary distinctions will give rise to numerous anomalies and general additional appeals by ratepayers for changes in rateable values to take them over the threshold and for changes in classification. It is therefore suggested that the intention of the clause should be clarified with a view to avoiding such anomalies, especially in relation to appeals. Will we have that clarification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can clarify that briefly for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman and the Committee. The purpose

<br><blockquote><p>"if the local authority so determine".—[<i>Mr. McLeish.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment, although I understand the hon. Gentleman's intention. I refer him to clause 143 which gives rating authorities the power to remit payment of rates on the grounds of hardship, which is the point of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Reading my hon. Friend's mind, what does the Minister think was his intention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am used to answering on behalf of the Government, but I am being asked to stray into some unusual areas. However, as I understand it, the amendment would give local authorities discretion as to which specific, unoccupied properties should be subject to empty property rates. As I said, in relation to cases of hardship, that is covered by clause 143.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the metaphysical nature of that exchange but I am also impressed by the Minister's greater insight into the amendment than mine. My hon. Friend the Minister for Linlithgow sought a further insight into the Minister's insight into by amendment. I am happy with that and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the caluse stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposals are more complex than we might believe. Clause 141 appears to suggest a return to a proportion of owner rates being applied in the case of empty property. Normally, no landlord leaves a property empty as an expedient; a property is invariably empty because it cannot be let. A lease must come to an end if a new tenant cannot be found or for other, similar reasons associated with the vagaries of the property market at the time.<br><br>
The chartered surveyors, who know a great deal about these matters, suggest that it would be invidious to start to charge rates in those circumstances. They acknowledge that the position is extant in the current legislation but discretionary to local authorities. They instruct them that discretion should be applied and that no rates should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1929</span>
paid on property when it is vacant for a period of three to six months, depending on the authority.<br><br>
I have asked about the issue and I gather that it is a matter of some substance. An additional consideration is the detrimental effect on the recovery of the economy which might result from developers and speculators reconsidering whether to acquire an empty property when they will be faced with a rates bill before any development can take place. The chartered surveyors have serious anxieties that as a result, the growth in the property and construction industries could be stultified. I understand that the housebuilders are worried about the issue.<br><br>
The chartered surveyors are also anxious that the clause as drafted will lead to disputes about the definition of the person entitled to possession of lands and heritages.<br><br>
With regard to the suggestion that the Secretary of State will make regulations for a class or classes of lands and heritages, the chartered surveyors are anxious that a strong lobby may result in the Secretary of State highlighting one class rather than another. That would not be equitable and I would like the Minister to comment on it</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman on his last point, but I shall check the drafting of the clause and if it is necessary to make a change to reassure him, I shall return to the matter. There is no intention of the clause resulting in the discriminatory treatment to which he refers.<br><br>
The provisions bring into line the system with current operations in England and Wales. The hon. Gentleman's general concerns, which he raised on behalf of chartered surveyors, are not justified. However, I assure him that we shall consider carefully those matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask two simple questions. First, why do the Government think that they can operate the system better than the local authorities? Why will they be more effective in so doing?<br><br>
Secondly, will the Minister deal with the issue of the experience of local authority rating officers prior to 1975, when a similar arrangement operated, which showed that it was complex, frustrating, a waste of limited administration resources and not cost effective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why we are changing the system, which is potentially complex. Let me assure the hon. Member for Angus, East about the powers of the rating authority under clause 143, which is closely related to this discussion. Discretion regarding hardship will be exercised under clause 143 not by the Secretary of State, but by the local authorities.</span></p>

GRANTS IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN RATE REBATES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to make one of my all too infrequent contributions. That is my mother's opinion, as she told me at the weekend.<br><br>
I invite hon. Members to contrast what has happened in the Committee in the space of 15 minutes. When we discussed clause 138 15 minutes ago, with great animation Conservative Members gave away between £2 million and £5 million in a backhander to landowners. It is estimated that clause 145 will take away from local authorities about £30 million in specific grant to spend on disabled people. If the reply to this issue is that it will be covered by aggregate external finance, Opposition Members will find that very hard to believe. Experience of the past is that money mysteriously goes missing when it goes into that black hole.<br><br>
The clause's effect is to remove the obligation on the Government to reimburse local authorities for rates rebates on facilities for disabled people, including private and institutional property which disabled people might occupy and which would qualify for that relief. For some reason, the Government have chosen in the same clause to leave in rates relief for water and sewerage.<br><br>
I consulted Strathclyde and Lothian regional councils about the clause's effect. Strathclyde told me that the effect on its budget would be in the order of £14.5 million a year. If that is extrapolated for Scotland, the figure is about £30 million a year.<br><br>
My basic question to the Minister is, why is the clause in the Bill? I would like to know what it is supposed to achieve and why the Government are determined to do away with a specific grant to disabled people and no doubt replace it with funding from the AEF. That is not good enough because the money could be used for other purposes.<br><br>
What guarantees will there be that any increases that would have been made under current law will continue in AEF? No Minister could give such a guarantee, but if the law was left as it stands, we would know that services would be provided by means of a specific grant.<br><br>
Why is the date of the clause's implementation April 1995? Existing authorities will have to implement it and be the first to suffer its financial implications. By the time

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1931</span>
the successor authorities come in—if they ever do—there will have been a fait accompli. Why are the Government asking existing authorities to implement it? Such a thing is not provided for in many, if any, other parts of the Bill.<br><br>
The Bill would be better if the clause was not included. Will there be a reduction in AEF as a result of the change? What will be the effect on the AEF, not only for April 1995 but for future years? Does not the Minister agree that if he is to make promises that the measure is not about taking money from disabled facilities, it would be easier to believe him if the money were left as a specific grant rather than put in a black hole?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that the specific grant is already in AEF. There is no change, but the local authority has the discretion. The Government are proposing that this be paid from the revenue support grant component. We are proposing in clause 146, which deals with enterprise zones, that compensation be dealt with in that way.<br><br>
In general, local authorities welcome that principle. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities brief to the Committee makes the point that greater flexibility will be given to local authorities in the management of their resources. That is a fair point.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is making a genuine point and I—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The COSLA brief that I have suggests an amendment deleting the words
<br><blockquote><p>"no grant shall be paid"</p></blockquote>
and inserting the words
<br><blockquote><p>"a specific element of the Revenue Support Grant will be identified and paid".</p></blockquote>
That is precisely my point. The grant should be specific and identifiable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right; he has the same brief as me, but I stress the point about greater flexibility and that specific grants are not favoured in principle by local authorities. They take a perfectly reasonable view.<br><br>
The assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks, which prompted the amendment that COSLA suggested, is simple. He wishes to know whether local authorities will be worse off because of the change. Given that specific grants are now within AEF, I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that local authorities will be no worse off and that ratepayers will be completely unaffected by the change proposed in the clause.</span></p>

ABOLITION OF SCOTTISH VALUATION ADVISORY COUNCIL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a substantial issue here—the abolition of the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council. As a Member of Parliament, I have twice had to seek its help and on both occasions I found it an extremely helpful, efficient and effective body. It is impartial, and independent and has wide representation of all sectors involved in rating in Scotland. I do not think that it should be abolished. It has not outlived its useful purpose. We ought to argue strongly in favour of retaining the council, which performs an advisory and regulatory function, to ensure that valuation for rating is undertaken satisfactorily and efficiently under independent land valuation assessors.<br><br>
Those who specialise in valuation and rating matters take the same view. We have been influenced by the comments of those who have received similar help. I feel strongly about this because of personal constituency experience. I should welcome an explanation of why the council is to be abolished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, this is not simply a technical clause, but one which has a point of substance, so I shall take a moment or two to explain the position to him.<br><br>
The clause proposes not immediate abolition of the council but abolition with effect from 31 March 1996. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the council has introduced increasing professionalism and independence. It has assisted in initiating progress towards harmonisation of practice in Scotland—its essential role. All this was given greater impetus by co-operative working by assessors through their own professional bodies. Advice from these representative professional bodies with which the hon. Member for Linlithgow is familiar on major issues is often quickly available.<br><br>
The Government concluded, therefore, that when the arrangements for the forthcoming revaluation in 1995, and the reform of local government had been completed, any further related issues under this subject could be dealt with more expeditiously by consulting these professional representative bodies. We do not believe that there is a continuing need for a formal statutory body to advise on valuation matters in the new circumstances. That is not to detract in any way from the council's work so far, to which the hon. Member for Linlithgow rightly referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some years ago, when I represented Broxburn—which is no longer in the Linlithgow constituency but is now in the constituency of my hon.

Friend the Member for Livingston—I had cause to go to the council. The matter was complex and I thought that the council was excellent. It should meet more frequently. In my experience as a Member of Parliament, few things are more difficult than arguing a case with assessors. The task is almost as difficult as arguing with a procurator fiscal. It is not that assessors are difficult people but that they must be seen to be of independent judgment. Going to the SVAC is one way in which Members of Parliament can help their constituents.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will reconsider. The measure is not necessary.</span></p>

CALCULATION OF LIMITS ON SPENDING</div> <!-- title -->

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 876, in page 97, leave out lines 23 to 32.<br><br>
It would be useful to spend a few minutes on this clause. People who have been in local government appreciate the usefulness of section 83 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The spending powers of local authorities are rightly constrained heavily by statute, but when used responsibly, the section 83 provision often allows local authorities to implement various programmes or schemes, or to provide support for developments in their areas, which the detailed provisions of the various statutes covering local government would prevent.<br><br>
However, genuine worry remains about the clause and about the Government's motives. The changed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1934</span>
formulation in the clause would appear to reduce significantly spending by local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head. I look forward to hearing him confirm that that will not be the case. In addition, we are also suspicious about the tightening up of local authority powers implicit in the clause.<br><br>
An examination of recent events such as the Strathclyde referendum is instructive. I hope that the Minister—who is, I am sure, a connoisseur of the details that relate to Strathclyde's activities—will explain how the referendum was financed. It well have nothing to do with section 83, but perhaps this is the thin end of the wedge—not only a reduction in the permitted expenditure by local authorities but a more political narrowing of its scope.<br><br>
A range of issues, including economic and industrial activities are relevant to section 83, but I want to know specifically whether the measure has anything to do with curbing local authorities' powers to be involved in activities that the Government might find distasteful but which are nevertheless lawful under existing statute. Reassurances are needed about what the money may be spent on.<br><br>
We shall shortly discuss economic development, and section 83 and other local authority powers will be covered in relation to that. As the Government now pick up 87 per cent. of local authority expenditure, how can there be a need to tighten even more local authorities' powers to use their imagination or discretion or to innovate in their areas? The essence of local democracy must be that central Government must sometimes get off the backs of local authorities and allow them to determine their priorities, to spend on their needs and, if need be, to innovate. It would be a pity if local authorities had such heavy restraints that there was little difference between them. I hope that the Government will not seek to reduce expenditure and impose restrictions and conformity on its applications.<br><br>
The Minister is interested in mathematics and logic. He does not have his calculator with him, but I should like him to explain how the sum of £3.80 was arrived at. The Government may have good reason for it, but I suspect that it is to ensure a substantial reduction in overall relevant expenditure. Reassurance on that matter, too, is needed.<br><br>
The Government have taken many powers, over a long period, to control expenditure, and they must provide a significant justification for continuing that process. When the present Prime Minister was elected we thought that Government policy might change to allow local authorities some freedom and choice, flexibility and prioritisation of their own needs. Where is that? Where are the powers that local authorities should naturally have to do what they want in their areas? I suspect that, apart from the specific curtailing of expenditure, all that we are being given is another power aimed at bringing local authorities to heel in a modern age. We appear to be the only country in Europe that aims to abuse local government in this way. There will be tremendous expenditure cuts, because of the £50 billion deficit, and it cannot be right to boot local authorities in Scotland by means of a highly politicised attack on a key spending power.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1935</span>
The Minister has many questions to answer on clause 150. It would be useful if instead of providing a veneer of justification, such as has been applied to many clauses, he would tell us the Government's real thinking. If the Government were in a daft or more reckless mode—and it would be difficult to envisage them being even more reckless—they might get rid of the section that they are updating by way of clause 150. Why allow local authorities to spend any money at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what we are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that is not what the Government are doing. I am reassured to hear that. Perhaps when he replies to the debate he will put the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1936</span>
remark on the record more loudly and more formally. Our fear is that day in, day out, through incremental change, the local authorities are being emasculated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is paranoid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Whip does not say a great deal, but he says that I am paranoid. I am not paranoid, but I am committed to the future of local government. We have sat through nearly 150 clauses.</span></p>
