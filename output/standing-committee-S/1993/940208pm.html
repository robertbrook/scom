	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 1, in page 2, line 10, leave out "1996" and insert "1998".—	<i>[Mr. Home Robertson.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 2, in page 2, line 14, leave out "1996" and insert "1998".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 19, in page 2, line 14, leave out "1996" and insert "2000".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), I must tell him that I am aware of the letter from the Ayrshire Forum of Community Council Representatives. My impression is of a self-styled all-Ayrshire community council organisation. The letter shows that that group is based around Hurlford community council. A public meeting was held in Kilmarnock just before the end of the year and I was the only Member of Parliament from Ayrshire who was prepared to address those who attended. At that time, Ayrshire community councils were poorly represented, although there was community council representation from, believe it or not, Islay and from East Kilbride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) referred to the acceptability of Strathclyde's performance in Ayrshire. Once again I point to the proposals to site a proposed sewerage plant—which will treat sewage in south Ayrshire—at Greenan. The remoteness of Strathclyde and Glasgow councillors from the interests of Ayrshire is evident in a letter from the regional convenor of Strathclyde Councillor Sanderson, to a Mr. McKinney. It explains that Strathclyde chose that site for its sewerage plant because
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Committee was particularly concerned to ensure that the chosen location should be as remote as possible from other uses, industrial as well as residential,"—</p></blockquote>
and wait for it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"because of serious difficulties that had recently been experienced as a result of subsequent development adjacent to another treatment works."</p></blockquote>
That site is within 200 yds of domestic-residences. There is planning consent for domestic residences to be situated right up against the proposed site for the sewerage plant.
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
If ever there is an example of Strathclyde being totally remote from the needs of Ayrshire, this is it. I ask the hon. Member for East Lothian to bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the comments we have heard today cut right across the reasons given for opposing the Bill. Arguments have been made that this is a centralising Bill. Opposition Members' remarks about the envisaged involvement of a Scottish Parliament wipe away their claims that it is the Government who want to centralise. I commend the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) on the matter. Following the imposition of a Scottish Assembly, I believe that the Secretary of State for Scotland, as envisaged by Opposition Members, would have a say only if he took up the dual role of assemblyman as well as parliamentarian here at Westminster. That gives us all something to think about. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North suggested, it will bring under full scrutiny the requirement to re-examine the west Lothian question that was very much part of the deliberations in 1979. The hon. Member for East Lothian has much more knowledge and experience of that issue than I have, so I shall welcome his contributions on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask all members of the Committee not to delay the Bill. Let us get it through and on to the statute book so that it can bring about a reorganisation of local government in Scotland, which will, in the end, be popular with the Scottish people. The more that Opposition Members protest about the Bill, the more I feel that we must have it right. The last thing that they want is for the Conservatives to appear in a good light in Scotland. We shall be seen in that light. We shall take pride in the fact that we have introduced single-tier authorities to local government. They will serve Scotland well for many years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rush of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) to get the Bill on to the statute book is a slow one. The west Lothian question comes from a different era, but I have an Angus answer to it, which is straightforward. The hon. Gentleman admitted openly that the Bill was boundary driven, which confirms more than a few suspicions. I wish that the Minister were as open and honest as the hon. Gentleman who, in representing Ayr, must be. The fact that the Bill is boundary driven is its basic problem. In stating the real reason behind the Bill, however, the hon. Member for Ayr is, as a consequence, conceding the case for a commission and for proper consultation, neither of which we have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would reduce the timetable for elections and delay them for two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must inform the hon. Member for Tayside, North that I do not want to delay the Bill for two years, but for 20 or 30 years or until it is dumped, which is what should happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just referred to a commission. On the Labour party's case, does he agree that if a royal commission should investigate the structures and powers of local government in Scotland,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
it should equally investigate any future Parliament or Assembly that anyone should propose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The future of Scotland will be decided democratically by the Scottish people exercising their votes. I support a commission to consider this piece of Westminster legislation because it has been drafted in a rush and not thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrast the haste to put this Bill on to the statute book with the great care and meticulous concern exercised by the Wheatley commission. It considered the relevant matters in great detail and ensured that there was plenty of public consultation. This time, that simply has not taken place. I support a commission to ensure that the people are consulted. Future generations will have to live with the consequences of the Bill for as long or as little as it is in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government are making the same mistake as that made in 1974. They are putting the local government cart before the devolutionary or independence horse. It it logical and sensible to decide the shape of local government once the national question has been answered about whether we have the devolved Assembly that the Labour party wants or the independent Parliament that I seek. Once the national question is settled, it is easy and logical to fit in the sort of local government best suited to the needs of the Scottish people. The local government reform proposed in the Bill is not a substitute for that. The Government cannot hide from the national question forever. The majority of Scots want one form or other of decision-making power to be returned to Scotland. One day, their view will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logical path is to set that Parliament or Assembly up and within that framework have a strong, viable and independent local government system. If it is necessary to get rid of an unnecessary tier of government, I would volunteer the House as the first tier to be dispensed with. A commission would ensure that the local government system is properly constructed and, as far as possible, based on consensus. That is not the case at present. England has a local government commission with a £12 million budget and hopes to be given thought-through local government boundaries. That is not happening in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have forgotten the lessons of Wheatley and of the previous reorganisation. Wheatley examined the detail of what was required and achieved a great deal of consensus across the political parties. I reject the Minister's claim that the idea of a commission must be thrown out because of scale. There are currently fewer councils and their shape has changed because of the 1974 reorganisation, but, while the scale may be different, there is still the same problem of content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) ably discussed many problems concerning services, management and the content of local government and the local government system. The content is the same now as it was then and there should be a commission to examine boundaries so that local government can be administered properly, the people's wishes reflected and services delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
mentioned content and scale. A key difference between the position pre-Wheatley and the position at present is not just content and scale, but complexity. Wheatley was faced with an immensely complex task, with which the Committee is not faced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it was a complex, multi-tiered system, but the Minister is creating a multi-tiered system with a different shape of organisations. The content of local government is what is important, as is how services are shaped and delivered. That will be affected by the boundary changes that the Minister is introducing without proper and due consultation with the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A commission would allow the people, councillors and the councils to have a say in shaping boundaries that would be more suited to the needs of Scottish local government. The shape of local government differs from that of the 1970s, but the imperative remains to obtain understanding and consensus about services and their delivery, and the structure and management of local government. The Government have not addressed those issues, but created pochled boundaries. They expect services and management to follow boundaries chosen to suit their political needs and imperatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was not the Minister's intervention an astonishing giveaway? If he thinks that what is being done is not complex he must be living in cloud cuckoo land. It may be a great deal more complex than the reorganisation of the 1970s precisely because of the dependence on data bases and information technology. If he thinks that that is not complex he must be away with the fairies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for the wisdom of his intervention. The Government have never understood the nature of local government or given credit when it was due. The Government have forgotten the lessons of Wheatley and of 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that a commission would cause delay, confusion and planning blight. That was one of his reasons for rejecting it. Such delay, confusion and planning blight would be as nothing compared to the on-going systemic failures if the rushed, ill-thought-out Bill is passed. Through the Bill, the Government are creating the potential for massive local government problems. The delay provided by the amendment would help to ensure that any reorganisation is carried out correctly. The reforms must be right this time. Honourable Members should not have to return to the House to conduct another fundamental review of local government. That is no way to treat local government. The in-built flaws in the Bill will inevitably lead to future Montgomerys and Stodarts as the consequences of this rushed reform hit the public and become reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be reform, we must get the system right so that it will work for much longer than its predecessor's 20 years. Regular, systemic surgery will lead to dislocation, deterioration and a poorer quality of services to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government is too important to the Scottish people to allow speed and lack of consultation to create a shilpit creature of a Bill that is not up to the task. The fault
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
is with the Government. The Bill is completely partisan in its construction and in the way it is being rushed through, and the blame for that will eventually fall back on the Conservatives, because it is very much a Conservative Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister, why the rush? The timetable is clearly too tight and the Government will no doubt use it as an excuse for the imposition of an early guillotine. The timetable is rushed because that is how the Government constructed it. The rush to the guillotine will be their fault. It is important that we discuss the Bill fully and do not dash through major elements of it because of the guillotine procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there such haste to reorganise? The present system is not so atrocious that it must be wiped out so speedily. The present regions and districts deserve better than this ill-thought-out measure. That is another reason for asking the Government to slow down and take another look at the matter so that when the system is reformed it will last.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might be interested in a letter which his Scottish National Party district councillor sent to us all. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as democratic accountability is concerned, Angus District Council considers that single tier authorities will remove the dubiety which still exists as to the responsibilities of Local Authorities and thus reinforce democratic accountability."</p></blockquote>
That council seems keen to get on with the job of creating single-tier authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the amendment is passed and there is an Angus district council, that will be no wonder because it is a good example of a well-run Scottish council which will, as part of the system, continue to be well run as long as the SNP is in charge. I believe in a single-tier council. I remind the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch), who was not around for Wheatley reforms, that, had there been proper consultation and consensus, the Bill would have been much better than it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue from the Scottish perspective that the Bill is inadequate to meet the needs of our local government. If it is bulldozed through as the Government want, we shall have to face the consequences for some time. If there were a consensus, the Bill would be very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was there no Wheatley-type attempt at consensus? Why have not the people, the councils or the councillors been involved? Why was consultation so desultory? Within the constraints of its monthly meetings, Angus district council made great attempts to consult the people but the time scale was so short that it was not possible to make that consultation as meaningful as it should have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheatley had researchers and held public meetings. He went out of his way to discover whether there was a consensus across the Scottish political spectrum. That has not happened this time. A commission would be one method of trying to make good that deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of a search for consensus we have been given a Tory reorganisation. No one else wants it done this way. The Bill is simply partisan: it is seen by everyone as a Tory reorganisation and will be treated as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are local democratic powers being reduced? Why do the Government insist that there should be fewer
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
democratically elected local councillors? Why will there be even more quangos? Why is control of the water industry to move from a democratic system to unelected boards? Why is there a move towards much more centralised Government powers? The Minister has said that it is a decentralising measure but the reality is the opposite. This is a centralising measure, which gives more and more powers through secondary legislation, to the Secretary of State and central Government. It is a massive political sleight of hand which will be seen to be exactly that as time goes by. If the Minister really believes in local government why is the provision of local government services being reduced, especially water services? I am sure that the Minister knows that the majority of Scots, including many of his own supporters, do not want those water boards to be changed. They certainly do not want the boards to be used in Scotland as they were in England as a first step towards outright privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland are well satisfied with their high-quality local government services, supplied at local level. The Bill is simply a partisan approach from Conservatives who seek enabling councils rather than service providers. I am clear in my mind that I want to see those councils as service providers. That should be their major role. The Government are massively out of step with the Scottish public on this issue. There has been no attempt to listen to the democratic views of the people, it is merely the Government's partisan Bill that is being put through Committee as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about the difference between purchasers and providers. What does he think the proposed Moray council will be? Will it be a purchaser or a provider? Will it be able to cope? Will he table an amendment to alter its boundaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make sure that Moray council can cope. It should be a service provider. The Government are determined to turn those councils into enabling councils only and to strip them of their powers. Those councils get a mandate from the people and the people expect high-quality services from councils. That is what they get. If the hon. Gentleman had his way they would not be councils as we know them. Those services will be put out to undemocratic control, as is happening with water boards. The people will have no say about assets that local taxpayers have created over generations. They will be handed out to unelected, unaccountable boards. I do not wish to see that happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member from England would like a shot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, we have some experience of the privatisation of the water industry, but I do not want to question the hon. Gentleman about England. In France where until recently there was a socialist Government, two thirds of the water supply is controlled by private companies. Even in Poland, Russia and, for all I know, Albania water industries are being privatised. Why is the hon. Gentleman determined to be so many years behind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the number of disconnections made in England to be repeated in Scotland. If the hon. Member knew about my country he would realise the people's attitude towards and their confidence in our local government system. I do not want unelected, unaccountable quangos to replace elected, responsible councils. If the hon. Gentleman read the political surveys and the opinion polls he would see that the Scottish people are massively against the legislative change that he has been put on the Committee to force through against then wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has never left anyone in any doubt of the pride he has in Angus district council. Can he confirm that if the Bill goes through in its present form Angus district council will have more responsibilities and will be accountable for much more local government activity than it has at present? If he is so proud of it now, when it has the fewer responsibilities, why will he not be equally proud of it when it has greater responsibilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never heard a question like that in my life? When the additional responsibilities are taken on, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that, if it is an SNP-controlled council, it will continue to be run as one of the best in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North speaks of a move to give additional responsibilities to Angus. I should look forward to that day. I am sure that, as in the past, an Angus authority will again run education and run it well. But that is not my argument. It will not be responsible for water, but it should run water services. That is what the people of Scotland want and that is what the hon. Gentleman's Government are taking away from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a genuinely interesting speech. Perhaps we may be clear—in response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North—about what the hon. Gentleman is saying in relation to his own area. Is he saying that he would welcome a structure in which Angus district council or a council based broadly in Angus district takes responsibility for education, social work and the other regional functions that will remain with local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am specifically saying that Angus could do that and will do it well. Moreover, had the Minister listened to the point about a commission, the rest of the boundaries would have been as sensible as that for an Angus council. However, that has not happened. The Government have not consulted and are not listening to the people. They are rushing through this reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objection to the Bill is that it is pure gerrymandering for political purposes. It does not suit the needs and content of government My point to the Minister about content is that it is important to have boundaries that are suited to the communities that they are supposed to represent and are also suited to content of the services to be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more than with the hon. Gentleman's final remarks about getting the boundaries right. Surely the purpose of this Committee is to examine those boundaries. Are we not doing that? Amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
are tabled. Does not that perhaps meet the very points made by the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I worry when I am complimented by Conservative Members. But, no, that process does the opposite. This is the worst possible way to examine boundaries, with amendments that ricochet around the Committee. As we saw last time, it is a matter of chance which boundaries come through at the end. For example, Argyll managed to win last time, as did Fife. It tends to be a lottery in Committee, whereas these matters should be examined coolly, over time, so that we get them right. If we consider Committee sessions in this House and 12 years of research, study, consensus and discussion by Wheatley, the two do not compare. As the hon. Gentleman knows, in this Committee it is arithmetic and only arithmetic that counts. Is that how amendments will be passed? The Minister said that Parliament will decide. I know what that means: if a Conservative Member wishes something, he will get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a specific instance, I happen to agree with the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) that Angus should be an authority on its own and, as the people want Kincardine should not be joined with Angus. But that is a lottery and not the way to treat a serious subject such as boundary changes. It should have been treated as it was previously. The minimum way is by a commission which would have gone through the process of consultation and study so that there would have been a thought-through series of boundary changes rather than this mish-mash of what suits the Conservatives politically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This reorganisation will not stand the test of time. It is rushed, partisan and party political. It is not thought through and has no consensus, except against it. It is the wrong way to approach local government which involves a series of daily and essential services which affect everyone. It is almost an insult to local government that it will be reorganised on a partisan, rushed basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not careful the Government could be intent on destabilising the whole system. It is a gigantic mistake and others will pay the price. People have a right to expect that any fundamental reorganisation or reform of local government will last. But, instead, the Government produce a partisan, short-sighted approach on which there has not been proper consultation. That gives the reorganisation of local government the shakiest of starts and its future must be in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are guilty of failing and neglecting Scotland's local government system. They should be ashamed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). It is customary for radical thinkers to believe that Governments can find the money somehow for drains, stopcocks and culverts. On Second Reading, a Labour Member assessed the amount of money needed for those purposes at about £5 billion, an amount that has been mentioned more than once. I should like to hear the debate in the proposed Scottish Assembly, which would represent about 5 million people, on whether the effort of finding and spending £5 billion should be expended on the national health service or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
education, or on the repair of drains. The sum of£5 billion represents £1,000 for every person in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not only a problem in England. It is a problem in Scotland, as it is in any industrial country that does not belong to the third world. No Government can take £ 1,000 from each of 5 million taxpayers to achieve a sum of £5 billion to be spent on the sort of project described by the hon. Member for Angus, East Such money would be spent on health, education or other matters long before it was used in the way the hon. Gentleman described.

My hon. Friend the Minister of State made an inspired speech this morning. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I mean my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend has information that I do not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unlikely that I have information that my hon. Friend lacks, but I have every confidence in him. His speech this morning was indeed inspired. I feel compelled to comment on it. The passage of this excellent Bill should not be delayed. The Scottish people should not be deprived of its benefits for any longer than is necessary. The Bill will provide adequate or even better services at reasonable cost. There will be fewer councils and councillors and that is a problem, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State summed up the matter well on Second Reading when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, since 1979, as many as a quarter of Scotland's council houses have been sold to their tenants"—</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Opposition opposed that good policy at the time—
	<br><blockquote><p>"yet the number of staff employed by local authorities to provide housing services has actually increased in the same period by as much as two thirds, instead of reducing proportionately. We can no longer afford to burden Scotland with a system that produces such nonsense as that. Nor can we allow Scotland to continue to be burdened with a system of local government that is ineffective, unaccountable and shrouded in apathy."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 January 1994; Vol. 235, c. 537.]</p></blockquote>
Many people would agree with that Opposition Members must tell the Committee why they want a delay until 1998 or 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be a Labour Government then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East made the same point this morning. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The unlikely and unwelcome prospect of a Labour Government exists. No Labour Member has thought about Government for many many years. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that a Labour Government would introduce legislation but defer its implementation until after the next general election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the fact that my hon. Friend is fairly new to Scottish affairs, but that he has always taken a great interest in the subject I shall brief him on the fact that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) has predicted the coming of a Labour Government for the past 14 years, but has never got it right and I think that his record will continue well into the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That needs no comment from me. We are not surprised, of course. We admit that one day, there
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
may be a Labour Government but we know that one thing will not change even then—the awful sadness of Opposition Members who, regrettably, always turn out to be not representatives but delegates, most of them appointed by trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a debate such as this, relating as it does to there being fewer councils and councillors, and fewer council employees, we need to consider carefully whether some hon. Members might have some interest Especially relevant interests might relate to civil or public servants, municipal activities, or public employees. If any such interest existed, there is no doubt that a declaration of interest would have to be made. I am currently the only hon. Member who is not prepared to make a declaration of interest in that I make it at the time of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole subject of the Register of Members' Interests is just empire-building nonsense, but other hon. Members have signed it although I have not. The rule of declaration states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any debate or proceeding of the House or its committees"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The declaration of Members' interests has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to assess why some of what has been said this morning was said. I include the excellent speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. I ask merely because I have not heard—I have been here most of the time except for a brief time spent having a cup of coffee—why hon. Members have not disclosed any relevant interest or benefit that they may have had, may have or may expect to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Unfortunately, I was not here this morning; my hon. Friend was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lucky you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in Glasgow this morning. My ruing is that a declaration of interests has nothing to do with the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to you, Mr. Martin, that the amendment suggests, for no apparent reason, that the proposal be implemented after a general election and that we must wait until then. Why? I wanted to use one or two examples to decide whether, as appears obvious, one or two people had interests that might not be of particular interest to the Committee, but might have guided their tongues earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wondered about the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), for whom I have great respect. He is a parliamentary consultant to the Union of Civil and Public Servants. I say this to the hon. Gentleman: perhaps the number of civil and public servants is affected by—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can assist the hon. Gentleman. We know that hon. Members make their business interests known to the Register of Members' Interests, which may be examined by Members of the House and by the wider public. I will not allow the hon. Gentleman to continue discussing the register. What happened this morning has nothing to do with me. I am in the Chair and must tell the hon. Gentleman that he is on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
borderline of ignoring my ruling. He must get on with discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I think that the Chair is quite right, and I support the Chair. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not find my support of the Chair frivolous, and I hope that you will acknowledge that, Mr. Martin. Are you ruling it out of order for us to refer in debates on amendments to individuals' declared interests in the Register of Members' Interests? If that is your ruling, I want it to be made quite clear. Opposition Members regularly refer to the activities of Conservative Members, which can be seen in the Register of Members' Interests, and which they regard as extra-parliamentary activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows me well enough to know that I allow members of the Committee to comment in passing on matters outwith the amendment. My ruling is that I do not want a speech totally dedicated to the Register of Members' Interests—end of story. There are occasions when members of the Committee comment on a person's interests, and sometimes an hon. Member makes his interests known to the Committee. That is all right in passing, but a dedicated speech on the subject is not germane to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. This morning, when Sir James was in the Chair, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley quoted directly from the Register of Members' Interests. He implied that my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr could not make a valid contribution on a constituency matter because of some of his interests declared in the register. Are you saying that had you been in the Chair, you would have ruled that point out of order, and asked the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley to withdraw it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking me to make judgments on a matter on which I have no locus. I cannot be in Glasgow and in Committee at the same time—it is impossible. Any member of the Committee can make a contribution to the Committee, but they must confine their remarks to the amendment in front of them. My co-Chairman and I have allowed some leeway on the amendment, and have let the debate go as wide as discussing the Register of Members' Interests. If the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) can take that ruling on board, I invite him to speak to the amendment. If not, I invite him to remain seated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I draw your attention to paragraph 43 of the "Rules on the Registration and Declaration of Financial Interests". I can provide a list, if you wish, of those on the Committee who might have thought it prudent to take note. The paragraph says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Register of Members' Interests was intended to supplement but not to replace the longer-standing practice of the House that a
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
Member should draw attention to a relevant pecuniary interest when making a speech"</p></blockquote>
I do not challenge your ruling, Mr. Martin. However, in the light of that quotation, I wonder whether I could simply draw attention to particular interests. Opposition Members regularly draw attention to my membership of Lloyd's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the hon. Gentleman. It is up to individual members of the Committee to make their own declarations. It is their responsibility alone. If the hon. Member for Stroud wants to quote from the Register of Members' Interests, and intends to continue in that vein, I shall ask him to be seated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In his speech, the hon. Member for Stroud had started to refer to the interests of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. My hon. Friend has, like me, been sitting quietly and did not make any speeches this morning, so we could not have declared our interests. The hon. Gentleman is on the wrong track on that as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. Now we shall return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If your interpretation of paragraph 43 on the rules regarding Members' financial interests is as you describe, Mr. Martin, I cannot continue with my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting speech. I think that I know what the hon. Member for Stroud is driving at, but no one—including the hon. Gentleman—was clear about it. The debate has been extremely interesting; substantial speeches have been made. Only time will tell why the Minister spoke at length, and why Conservative Members contributed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke at some length because I was constantly asked to give way by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether that is the real reason. Last Thursday, the Minister was unaccommodating to those who wished to intervene. His generosity today is probably part of his normal good nature. I am sure that he has no ulterior motive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East made a good speech. My hon. Friend the Member for what is now East Lothian made a splendid contribution when he introduced the debate. However, we shall all remember the contribution of the hon. Member for Ayr most vividly. The content of most of his speech drifted out of the window. But he admitted something that no other Tory has acknowledged: the Bill is boundary driven. We knew that, but the hon. Member for Ayr confirmed it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has changed his mind after speaking to the Government Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand behind the words that I said this morning I did not say that the whole Bill was boundary driven. I said that a major proportion of the measure was affected by boundary changes. I stand 100 per cent. behind

the words that I said this morning; they will appear in 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The verdict is guilty. I warn the hon. Gentleman that we shall remember his words and that we shall remind him of what he admitted so brutally honestly this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to consider one aspect of the Bill. The amendment would ideally provide for a Scottish Parliament; it would provide at least for an independent commission or review to consider a matter that bothers people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman is so excited. I give way for the last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. I am not excited. The hon. Gentleman has made a fundamental point. He said that an independent commission should examine the structures and powers of local government. Does he agree that such a commission should examine the concept of a Scottish Parliament or Assembly? That is the logic of his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the logic of my case. There is no logic in the hon. Gentleman's point, but that is not unusual.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. I intend to make a point, which the Committee can discuss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not giving way. The Labour party manifesto for the next general election will include a commitment to a Scottish Parliament. We shall win that election and there will be a Parliament in Scotland. That is a fact. I hope that that Parliament would then carefully examine the system of local government in Scotland. The amendment would permit scrutiny of the Bill. The first line of the explanatory and financial memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>"Part I</i> of the Bill provides for the creation of a unitary structure of local government in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
That explanatory memorandum is not, of course, the Bill, which is an important point as no attempt is made in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
Bill to convey such inaccurate information. In fact, the Bill will create multi-layered local government in Scotland. It is true that, if passed, the Bill will create several unitary authorities. However, a host of joint boards will be created in addition. Some of them have specified purposes such as police and fire services, but many are undefined. Individual councils will be able to set up such bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also provides for decentralised powers in each of the councils. Clause 23 makes it clear that there will be powers to establish committees for "particular areas" within individual councils. Additionally, there will be provisions for community councils in each of the areas where the so-called "unitary authorities" are set up. If that were not sufficient creation of layers of new government, the Secretary of State for Scotland takes on himself, on virtually every page of the Bill, powers to do other things. That amounts to another level of supposed local government, in the form of the Secretary of State's diktat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend appreciate that in South Ayrshire, about which much was said on the subject of bringing government closer to people, there will be eight such joint boards or quangos, and that in East Renfrewshire there will also be eight such bodies for people to deal with to obtain local government services? At present they have one layer to deal with—either the district or the region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, except that perhaps his claims are too modest. Those are the minimum figures for bringing the Bill into effect. A delay is clearly needed to allow a Scottish Parliament or an independent review to examine that structure in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have wasted enough time in this debate and therefore I intend to make my point to allow the Committee to continue the important task of scrutinising the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parliament would also carefully consider the matter of quangos. Quangos are hugely controversial and are exciting considerable public interest. The Bill will create several unaccountable quangos, which will be remote from the people, including the three mega quangos that will run the water authorities if the Bill is passed. The question of accountability therefore arises. What the Government call non-departmental Government bodies, and the public has come to understand as quangos, will have to survive scrutiny, but at the moment they fail that test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parliament or the independent review would wish to attend carefully to the eighth report of the Public Accounts Committee, entitled "The Proper Conduct of Public Business", to ascertain precisely how the non-departmental public boards that the Bill might create are intended to operate. The report is devastating in its criticism of the conduct of public business and the operation of quangos organised by the Governments of the past 14 years. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In recent years we have seen and reported on a number of serious failures in administrative and financial systems and controls within departments and other public bodies, which have led to money being wasted or otherwise improperly spent. These failings represent a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
departure from the standards of public conduct which have mainly been established during the past 140 years."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of one of the most senior Select Committees, which has a Conservative majority, adjudicating on the way in which those bodies have operated under a Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is even more relevant to our debates about the need for a delay. Paragraph 5 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But there is no reason why a proper concern for the sensible conduct of public business and care for the honest handling of public money should not be combined with effective programmes for promoting economy and efficiency."</p></blockquote>
Again, those are the words of one of the most senior Select Committees. They condemn the way in which Government have conducted public bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two weeks ago, Councillor John Young, a Conservative councillor on Glasgow City district council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rare thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is. I am sure that he is not known to five Conservative members of the Committee. John Young, a Conservative councillor, not a Labour member of the Committee, made a prediction about the effect of the Bill. In the presence of the Minister, he said that if the Bill came into force, by 1996, there would be more than 7,000 quango appointments in Scotland, but only 1,200 elected councillors. Even a Conservative councillor found that paradoxical. I would call it shocking. However, that is what the Government are supervising and it will become much worse as a consequence of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has not remained silent about such criticism. I am not surprised. He must feel highly defensive when even senior members of his own ranks make telling points against him. Yesterday, at a seminar in Glasgow bizarrely entitled "Reinventing Government"—not bad for a Government who have been in power for the past 14 and a half years—the Secretary of State decided to defend the patronage that he exercises and the system that produces the 7,000 appointments that Councillor Young found so remarkable and so disturbing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thoughts of the Secretary of State should be shared with the Committee because the amendment would provide the delay to the operation of the Bill that would allow the public to examine the way in which public business is taken out of the hands of accountable, elected councillors and handed over on a plate to those who are distant and remote from the ballot box. Yesterday, the Secretary of State, in describing non-elected bodies, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nor are they a source of overweening centralised patronage, as has been suggested in some quarters. School boards and LECs"—</p></blockquote>
local enterprise companies—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are self-forming local bodies—gaining their authority in one case"—</p></blockquote>
the school boards—
	<br><blockquote><p>"through election by their peers and in the other by renewable, and potentially competitive, contract with their parent body."</p></blockquote>
We should run a competition to decide precisely what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As my colleague William Waldegrave, who has lead responsibility for reinventing government, has said"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
I wonder whether the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster knows that he has that lead responsibility. He should have thought about that when he was in front of the Scott inquiry. That would have dazzled Lord Justice Scott. Reinventing the facts more accurately describes what the right hon. Gentleman was doing. However, the Minister responsible for reinventing government said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Managing by contract can increase real-world, as opposed to text-book, accountability"</p></blockquote>
That is the definition of the new accountability.

Members of the boards of local enterprise companies, who handle large sums of public money, appoint themselves. They do not even have to notify the parent body, Scottish Enterprise, or notify or be sanctioned by the Secretary of State. They do not even have to write a letter notifying Scottish Enterprise of the new directors of the local enterprise company. How on earth can the Secretary of State claim that those bodies are now accountable to the public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) questioned the Office of Public Service and Science, the lead Department for reinventing government. The Under-Secretary answered, telling him how many executive agencies have been established under the "next steps" initiative. The answer runs to two close-typed sheets revealing that 154 executive agencies—that is one set—have been formed by the Government, all at one remove and all of them clones of the sort of organisations that the Government will create through the Bill in place of elected local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that information and the speech by the Secretary of State yesterday in Scotland about reinventing government, I have written to him, asking for an immediate review of the quangos under his control, how they are identified, how they are selected by him and how he monitors their performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also asked the Secretary of State to institute a register of interests. It should apply to the super quangos that will be formed under the Bill's water provisions. If the amendment was passed, there would be time for a register to be instituted. A firm register of interests should be established for all quangos because there must be a tough regulatory regime if the Scottish public are to be reassured that their affairs and money are in safe hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also asked the Secretary of State, who of course is not in Committee, for a debate in the Scottish Grand Committee about the important issue of quangos. In the interests of open government and of clarifying the eccentric ideas in his speech yesterday, I hope we shall have the opportunity for a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment was passed, the Scottish people would have an opportunity to vote in a general election and institute a Scottish Parliament that would be able to examine the system of local government in Scotland and to decide what provisions are best for it. The Committee should support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), but unfortunately he got to his feet with such alacrity that I was not able to catch your eye, Mr. Martin. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend address the question that the hon. member for Hamilton did not address? He did not allow an intervention, perhaps because he knew that he was wrong. Local enterprise companies are clearly accountable to Scottish Enterprise or to Highlands and Islands Enterprise.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a member because of my business interests. Is my hon. Friend aware of the close scrutiny of local enterprise company activities and is he aware that accountability is significant? While he questions the hon. Member for Hamilton, he may also like to ask him whether the cost of a Scottish Parliament will be included in Labour's manifesto. The Scottish people would want to know that before voting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, particularly about LECs. The Opposition refuse to understand that quangos and LECs stand on their performances, which are clear for everybody to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Public Accounts Committee has reported on their performances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that. The Public Accounts Committee points out that one advantage of quangos is that they are transparent. Quangos that misbehave or that are incompetent can be exposed to the public gaze of bodies such as the Public Accounts Committee in a way that local government can never be. The history of local government in some cases, such as Monklands, is that some authorities have been consistently bad administrators. [HON. MEMBERS: "What about the Audit Commission?"] The Audit Commission is a relatively new intervention and is able to cover only a fraction of cases. Quangos are exposed to the public gaze throughout their lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a distinction between the accountability of local authorities and that of quangos? The electorate have the opportunity to remove councils or councillors by the democratic process, but they do not have the same opportunity to remove members of, or entire, quangos. There is a difference in accountability, downwards and upwards. Those who are accountable only upwards, to the Scottish Enterprise board and to the Minister, have a completely different accountability and have an interest in covering up misdemeanours, whereas for those who are accountable to the public through the ballot box, there is a clear interest in identifying difficulties so that the public can sort them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have many years of local government experience and I must say that accountability in local government is a sham. Fewer than 30 per cent. of voters usually vote. Councillors often have little idea of what is being done in their name, particularly in larger authorities, and that is why there have been mistakes and corruption in local government. Quangos are transparent organisations and have to expose their accounts annually. If people and hon. Members criticise them, public opinion will force the Secretary of State to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems for hon. Members representing English constituencies who participate in Committees discussing Scottish Bills is that they do not know what is happening in Scotland. For example, does the hon. Gentleman understand that Tayside Enterprise, which is the local enterprise company in my area, refuses to publish to whom it gives money in Tayside and in Dundee? Its annual accounts do not state who is in receipt of grants and loans. However, Tayside regional council and Dundee district council have to make known where every single penny of their public accounts goes. What is transparent in Scotland is local government democracy; what is not are the quangos imposed on us by the Minister and his friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will not be surprised if I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I am not familiar with the particular case in Dundee, but I cannot imagine an LEC that gives sensitive commercial loans—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Why laugh about that? If a degree of secrecy were not involved, the transaction would be completely useless. [HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Gentleman said that quangos were transparent."] I shall not labour the point. I give way to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, whose constituency name I can never pronounce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman pronounced it extremely well; we look forward to welcoming him to Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. He was coy about explaining his experience in local government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.

In my speech, I mentioned my experience as a council leader. It is not irrelevent, in discussion of a local government Bill, for an hon. Member to refer to his or her experience. That is different from a declaration of interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in the middle of an intervention, I think, before two points of order were raised.

Any scrutiny of the council would produce a clean bill of health. My experience of Wandsworth council allows me to answer the hon. Member for Hamilton, who asked about joint boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton is not in the Room, but my hon. Friend will know that that hon. Gentleman did not give way to questions intended to elicit elucidation of several matters. The pertinent questions to the hon. Member for Hamilton would concern what is meant by the terms "Scottish Assembly" or "Scottish Parliament"? How would such a body be brought into being? What powers would it have? How would it exercise those powers and who would pay for it? What impact would such a body have on local government in Scotland? The hon. Member for Hamilton gave no clues about such questions. As to a public inquiry into the structure of local government in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman knows that interventions should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to embark on a lengthy debate about a Scottish Parliament, although my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North is right to raise the matter. I was much amused at this morning's sitting to hear my hon. Friend the Minister talking about a putative Secretary of State without portfolio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Joint boards are not necessarily the answer for all smaller local authorities, who may simply purchase services from another organisation. That is the modern way of doing things. Joint boards are not the answer. If a local authority does not want to run its own social services, it can buy them in. Opposition Members should consider that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who want to delay the Bill could learn from the lessons of England. A local government commission started work in 1992 examining local government in England. That work rolled slowly on and was probably necessary, given the size and complexity of the local government structure in England, but the experiences in Wales and now in Scotland make me wish that we had not been burdened with such cumbersome
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
machinery. One of the original mistakes was the commission's timespan. It would not reach Northumberland, my county, until 1997. The Secretary of State has truncated that rolling programme, which will now end this coming year. That decision was greeted with enormous relief by all those involved in local government in Northumberland, including the officers. They did not want to wait until 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the county of Northumberland there is one county council and six district councils, including Berwick-upon-Tweed, which we still own, and Tynedale—my local district council—which appears to be an attractive tourist resort for the youth league of the Scottish National party, which visits it occasionally and distributes leaflets in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem about the long-delayed rolling programme was that it caused enormous uncertainty in terms of capital planning and capital programming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Berwick-upon-Tweed district council, for example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Borough council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Berwick borough council was contemplating spending money on a swimming pool but it is uncertain whether to do so because it does not know what its position will be in two or three years' time. Good officers are leaving local authorities and the amendment would have that effect on Scottish local government. Good local government officers who are uncertain about their future leave quickly for other, more secure jobs. In Northumberland, local government officers are leaving to work for authorities whose future has already been decided by the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Delay is dangerous and damaging. It destabilises staff and creates difficulty in capital planning. We should therefore reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton discussed layers of government. Will my hon. Friend speculate on whether the Labour party believes in government in Brussels, in Westminster, in a Scottish Assembly and in local government? How many tiers of government do the Opposition believe in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends are taxing me with their interventions. I make it about six tiers of government. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North spoke about the role of the Scottish Parliament. I am even more confused about the Opposition's position on local, regional, parliamentary and European government than when I first came to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the proposal that the introduction should be delayed. It is important to have an independent commission to review service provision. If we want local government services in which the needs of the recipients are paramount, we must review how those services can be organised and run in future, rather than create boundaries and then decide how the services will slot into them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill, the issue of boundaries comes before that of services. That shows clearly that it is a boundary-led reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth recording that that was the pattern in the previous Bill, which followed the Wheatley commission report to which hon. Gentlemen referred. There is no precedent for boundaries to be considered early in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's correction. I am inexperienced in the matter as I was not here at the time of the Wheatley commission. My main point was that the Wheatley commission and associated discussions allowed debate on the provision of services to precede the organisation of boundaries. An assessment by an independent body should not necessarily be accepted lock, stock and barrel because other factors should be taken into account. The final decision should be taken by elected members. Many substantial issues need to be taken into account which are not being considered under this system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are anxieties about local government services. I understand how Conservative Members and people in the communities have come to believe that reorganisation is the solution to some of the difficulties. However, the main problem for local government, which has caused resentment and unhappiness among many recipients of services, is underfunding. There was great resentment about Strathclyde council, of which I was a member, from people who received education services. They were especially unhappy about the state of many of the school buildings. I had to explain time and again that our capital allocation from central Government had been substantially cut, year after year. I explained that we built two primary schools a year when we had 800 schools. At that rate of replacement, each primary school that we built had to have a life expectancy of 400 years. With such underfunding, it is inevitable that people will be unhappy about the provision of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unscrupulous people, or those with other agendas, will argue that a change of boundaries will overcome those difficulties. There was such an example earlier. The hon. Member for Ayr said that reorganisation would result in an expansion of nursery provision in his constituency. Unless that council robs from another part of its budget or the Government decide to allocate a disproportionate share of money to that council, it is unlikely that they will receive additional resources for the education of children under five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the figures for under fives' education in the Strathclyde region, Ayrshire compares well with Argyll and Bute, it is on a par with Renfrew and does less well compared with Glasgow and Lanarkshire. The question is whether service provision is allocated pro rata per head of the population or according to need. Allocation according to need has inevitably resulted in those areas which are the poorest receiving, largely through urban aid, what might be seen as a disproportionate share of resources. Thus there is a clash of policy—should allocation be according to need or according to geographical proximity? In such circumstances, a change of boundaries will not necessarily result in greater provision for under fives in Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can claim that the people of Ayr would be robbing others if there were nursery provision in the area covered by the new South Ayrshire authority, given that
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
the people of Ayr would provide for the level of services through the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, Strathclyde spends £42 million on provision for the under fives without any Government grant support. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that Ayr will drastically expand nursery provision, whether nursery education or something else? That will mean substantial increases in council tax, the cutting of another service, or—it is much more likely—there will be a distortion of grant allocation by the Scottish Office to ensure that Tory authorities receive services and have lower taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's speech is interesting. Although he may criticise the total grant, the distribution is agreed through the distribution committee, which is a joint committee of the Scottish Office and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is aware that the budget for children under five is discretionary. It is raised by the local authority and allocated according to need. It is also funded largely by urban aid which does not go through the COSLA mechanism. The Minister is aware that in meetings of COSLA and the Scottish Office, tensions arise—they are not always creative—between Government officials and local authority representatives, and amongst local authority representatives. There is a tremendous opportunity for the Government to play off local authorities against each other if they so wish, and to reach a consensus that favours Tory-controlled authorities, which I confidently predict will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made of local government services and the concept of re-inventing Government. Since Wheatley there have been considerable changes in the way in which local government services are provided. There are new ways of doing things, not all of which I agree with. Initially I had reservations about many of them, although I recognise that they can be useful in some circumstances. We need to debate these issues and decide on the appropriate size of authorities in such circumstances, and whether, in some cases, authorities of less than a certain size would be inappropriate. That would help to develop a culture in which people would look more creatively at the issues, and we could assess how services should be provided before changing the boundaries. We have caused serious difficulties by doing things the wrong way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COSLA report showed clearly that substantial additional costs would flow from a reorganisation of local government. I believe that the Government opposed the estimates on the basis that they were exaggerated. I look forward to hearing confirmation that the Minister has had discussions with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and examined CIPFA's request for figures. I hope also that he will give the Committee an answer about how the differences were arrived at and resolved. The Scottish people need to be told the precise cost of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One main argument of the Government has been that reorganisation will save money. I do not believe that. However, I accept that reorganisation to save money is but one pillar of Government strategy, and that other arguments also favour reorganisation. I do not agree with those either, but it would be in the interests of serious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
and objective debate to know the facts before starting discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members are not committed to serious debate. I have not been in Parliament for long but I have been appalled by the conduct of many of them. They seem to treat serious issues with a flippancy that is totally unbecoming. The issues are important to those who receive services, to people whose children attend schools or enjoy further education provision or have parents cared for by home help services and so on. The constant jeering, catcalling, braying and forced laughter from some Conservative Members is repellant. The standard of debate tolerated would be uancceptable in local authorities and outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not come to the House to play games, nor, I believe, did the majority of hon. Members. I hope that some of them will cease playing games and participate in the serious debate and discussion that so many issues merit. I hope that the Minister will stop going round the houses in what I can only assume is a deliberate attempt to waste time and avoid discussion of many matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. If the Minister were going round the houses and wasting time, would not the Chair take him to task?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone wastes time in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all have different opinions. The Chair is supposed to prevent the Minister or any other hon. Member from being totally outrageous. The Minister goes as near to the line as possible. I have heard him speak on other occasions and I know that he can respond succinctly when he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is challenging the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is best if the hon. Gentleman considers the point that the Committee is discussing and not the behaviour of other hon. Members. I shall be the judge of who goes too close to the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what you say, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Scotland deserve better from the Government than the quality of the debate so far. If the Committee was sitting in Scotland and many people were able to watch the proceedings, they would be appalled at the flippancy with which serious issues are treated. That is our honest opinion. I hope that Conservative Members will amend their behaviour to enable us to do our best for the people whom we were sent here to represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to assess the impact of the provisions because no exact parallels exist. If we consider reorganisations that have taken place in the past, it is clear that they tend to deliver less and cost more than expected. I do not believe that the Government's claims about the financial gains that we shall receive will be borne out. When the Inner London education authority was abolished, people claimed that bureaucracy would be slashed and enormous savings would be made. When
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
Westminster's chief education officer was appointed in 1990, he was responsible for eight secondary schools and 43 primary schools and commanded a salary of £60,000. That was a higher wage than that commanded by the equivalent job in ILEA, which entailed responsibility for 139 secondary schools and 754 primary schools. When ILEA was abolished, there was an explosion of staff who earned more than £20,000 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here, hear. Very rum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Tam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In aggregate, across the borough education authorities, there was an increase of 238 jobs—that is 67 per cent.—with a salary of £20,000 or more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used the phrase "in aggregate". That is a crucial expression. After ILEA was abolished, some boroughs spent less on education and produced a more efficient education service, but in others, the number of education administrative staff exploded. It is curious that spending increased in Labour-controlled boroughs and decreased in Conservative-controlled boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned people who earn more than £20,000 a year. It was almost impossible to employ a senior teacher in central London for less than £20,000. Those who held senior teaching posts deserved that money. Boroughs that rewarded teachers properly deserve credit, not criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that point and I shall return to it later. My point was about administrative, not teaching posts. Many more people earned more than £20,000 a year in 1991 after the abolition of ILEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes the abolition of many regional education authorities. That will mean more directors, deputy directors and assistant directors of education, and more education officers. That will not improve the education of individual children. Reorganisation will lead to the appointment of more administrators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the example of the health service. That issue should be adequately explored by an independent commission. In the case of the proposals for local government, there ought to be an independent commission to examine how things would be organised subsequently. We need to assess the extent of the financial loss incurred once economies of scale are no longer possible. It would be helpful to see how much we will give up, through the loss of bulk purchasing arrangements, once the reorganisation is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Large authorities now have the resources to self-insure but how much money will be lost when, as a result of reorganisation, that is no longer possible. I will not repeat what has been said about the effects on information technology. How will small authorities provide special education? The Government have not yet told us how that will be organised. How will adoption costs be handled? At present, as I understand it, the majority of children coming forward for adoption in Strathclyde come from in Glasgow yet they tend to be placed outside the city. What financial arrangements will be made in such circumstances? Will payments be made for children transferring across authorities? If not, will it mean that one authority has a disproportionate share of the burden?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
None of that has been adequately explored before this rush to implement reorganisation on new boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the new authorities deal with outdoor centres? At present every outdoor centre in Strathclyde is in Argyll—in future Argyll will have far more than it needs. What arrangements will be made for cross-border payments? What will happen if no arrangements are made? Will that destroy the present arrangements or will every authority try to establish its own outdoor centre in its area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those issues have not been adequately discussed. What will happen when boundaries are crossed for service provision? We are aware of the difficulties concerning Catholic education but they apply to all educational provision. A number of solutions to ease those difficulties have been identified. Although I do not believe that those difficulties are nearly as severe as is being made out at present, they should be addressed. Unjustifiable anxiety is being caused because service provision issues are not being discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements can be made for cross-border traffic. Arrangements can be made as in the bursary provision for a variety of payments between authorities. Internal markets have advantages in some circumstances but they have substantial costs. It is not clear, because no one has bothered to assess it as far as I am aware, whether the costs will outweigh the benefits. We should discuss those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have often been told that the costs of fragmentation will be met by joint boards and by co-ordination across authorities. Co-ordination never actually works as well as people expect when they write papers. There are always vested interests which people are not necessarily prepared to subsume in joint negotiations when they are overcome in collective discussions in the one authority. None of that has been adequately discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effectiveness of large authorities in terms of industrial development has never been adequately explored. No one has explained how the loss of that influence will be overcome. My own former authority of Strathclyde when seeking to attract inward investment was able to establish a portfolio of sites because of the scale of its operation. I cannot see how that will be adequately dealt with under the new provision. I cannot see how, without enormous bureaucracy, water, education, further education and road services will be co-ordinated in order to attract big firms when there is a combination of quangos, joint boards, individual wee footerie local authorities and LECs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A joint, single-door approach is needed to industrial development to attract people in. The pattern of provision in the Bill is almost deliberately designed to prevent that happening unless a supremo organisation is appointed to be responsible for such matters. That, however, means centralisation under the Scottish Office. The Government might not propose to deal with the matter like that, but they have given us no answers about their intended approach. No one has carried out an objective examination of the proposals and, so far, we have been given no answers about how strategy issues will be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr earlier indicated his unhappiness about road provision in his constituency. The Ayr road route is an interesting example, because part of it runs through my constituency. It is difficult
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
to imagine how that would ever be constructed without Strathclyde. There is no real interest in my area—from Glasgow in general—to build a road route to Ayr. It offers no advantage to us. It simply means knocking down lots of trees and the emission of more fumes in the area. Why should it be built without a strategic planning authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes the very point that I have been trying to get through to Opposition Members. Strathclyde has expressed no interest. There has been a failure to provide. We need to have a fresh look at the issue. If the route were to be a trunk road—under the responsibility of the Scottish office—perhaps we would ultimately get it, and in the not too distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman says that any such system would be provided through trunk roads. That is equivalent to centralisation. In effect, it means that powers currently held by the local authorities would be transferred to the Scottish Office. Whatever that involves, it certainly would not bring powers closer to the people; it would not delegate matters downwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the other points that I wanted to mention have been covered. I have been told to speed up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. In that case, I shall give the Committee more of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a great speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A balance must be struck between delivering services close to people and delivering them effectively, efficiently and with economy. I am not prepared to say that the present balance is absolutely correct. Changes could be made, but the case for the Government's drastic proposed change has not been made. There is a logical case for change and an intellectual case in the sense of benefiting the people whom we serve, but the Government have not made any such case. Without a commission or a similar body to examine service provision, people will perhaps logically conclude that a different motivation lies behind the Bill. The simple motivation of gerrymandering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day the Government made it clear that no new money would be made available for reorganisation. I prefer to believe the objective estimates from CIPFA officers via COSLA. The people in Scotland are being asked to pay a substantial sum which will come either from an increase in charges or from cuts in services, simply for Tory gerrymandering. In such circumstances, we are right to call for the Bill to be subject to considerable delay so that the people of Scotland have a chance to examine it more carefully in the fullness of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Perhaps I may register that it is a crying shame that television cameras were not in the Room to hear my hon. Friend's devastating speech. If we lived in a rational world, we should pack up now and forget the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the usual channels are not operating, I sense from this Committee that I should not speak at excessive length on this occasion.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
I wish to respond to some of the remarks made in the debate. There have been almost two debates: the first was a political one; the second was a reasoned debate in which a large number of constructive and sensible points were made by the hon. Members for Glasgow, Govan and for Falkirk, East. I welcome that and no doubt we shall return to several of those observations as we progress through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the hon. Member for Hamilton spent a little while delivering a speech, immediately after which, I believe—I should not want wrongly to accuse him—he rushed out to give part of it to the press. I have no doubt that we shall read his words about quangos and the Secretary of State tomorrow. There is nothing wrong in the suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Could you clarify whether the Minister's remarks could be deemed to be time-wasting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If any hon. Member were wasting time, I should soon bring the fact to his attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only offered about three sentences so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two of which were complimentary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will teach me. The definition of time-wasting from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan is my saying that he has made a reasonable speech. I should know better. I shall not repeat that obvious error of judgment for the rest of the Committee's sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of quangos, I commend to the hon. Member for Hamilton the excellent speech made last night by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). I know that the hon. Gentleman was unable to attend the relevant debate as he was otherwise engaged, and I make no criticism of that. My hon. Friend made an excellent speech which covered many of the points that the hon. Gentleman made this afternoon. It is a pity that he did not read that speech before making those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also surprised by the allegation that decentralisation constitutes another tier of local government. Several Labour councils have already instituted effective decentralisation measures including, to take an example that will be well known to the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster), Renfrew district council. Glasgow and Fife are also doing that. We commend such schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear of that change of heart in the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party, because when I was trying to have those decentralisation plans accepted in Renfrew district council, they were rigorously opposed by the Tory group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the plans were positively amended in accordance with the sensible suggestions of the Conservative group on Renfrew district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, but as the hon. Member for Hamilton did not give way more than twice, neither shall I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave way more than twice, but the requests were becoming excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not opposed to decentralisation. The entire thrust of the Labour party's argument has been towards decentralisation. I was drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that the Government claim to be setting up a unitary system when they clearly are not doing so. The statutory requirement for decentralisation may well be greeted by Labour Members as a welcome element in a bad Bill; a unitary system is not being set up. A multilayer system—of which one of the better aspects is decentralisation—is being set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the hon. Gentleman is referring to joint boards and joint arrangements. Joint boards already exist in Scottish local authorities. Presumably the hon. Gentleman considers the existing system to be three tiered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East referred, in his serious speech, to the Wheatley commission. Times have moved on since that commission and the principle underlying many of its recommendations is no longer generally accepted. The enabling concept of local authorities which has, as several of my hon. Friends have mentioned, come to the fore, is not simply a Conservative concept. A range of Labour-led district councils have sent representatives to the Scottish Office to put forward proposals for their agenda for change. They have consistently answered charges about their ability to supply specialist services with the argument that they would do so by joint arrangements with other authorities, and by acting as enabling authorities with the involvement of the voluntary or private sectors. It is Labour Members who are behind the times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) invited me to spell out yet again the reasons why we are not having an independent commission in Scotland. They have been spelt out on a number of occasions, but I shall summarise them again as I have been invited to do so. The task facing us in the 1990s is significantly simpler than that faced by Lord Wheatley and his colleagues in the 1960s. The existence of a commission in England does not automatically mean that such a commission is correct for Scotland. Surely a far more apt parallel would be the decision in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked me to spell it out. I am replying to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Angus, East, that, as on the previous occasion, it is a matter for Parliament to decide—not necessarily this Committee, which makes recommendations to the whole House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that he simply does not have a case? If he had, he would put it under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
independent scrutiny of a commission. We agree that Parliament should always decide—that is why we are elected—but if he had any confidence in this gerrymandering nonsense, he would put his proposals to an independent commission to see whether they are worthwhile or whether other proposals are equally worthwhile. Why will he not allow an independent commission to scrutinise his crazy proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party is now putting forward a different policy. Its policy until now has been that an independent commission should take evidence and then make recommendations to the Government. Is that not the Labour party's policy under this amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, to Parliament. The hon. Gentleman is now saying something quite different—that the Government should put their proposals to an independent commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is seeking to mislead the Committee. If the Government believe in the wisdom and efficacy of their case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am surprised at an Opposition Member for suggesting that the Minister has misled the Committee, because had he done so, the Chair would have corrected him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not say that the Minister was misleading the Committee. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said that the Minister had been generous enough to give way. I think that the Minister has sought to distort—instead of mislead—the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not distorting the debate or misleading the Committee. We should not use that language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw that remark. In Scotland, there is a perception that the Government are refusing to have an independent commission so that they can hide the reality—that this measure is boundary led and is about buying services. Will the Minister tell the Committee why he will not allow an independent commission to scrutinise the proposals in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, this is a complete change of policy by the Labour party. It is suggesting that the Government should put their proposals to another body instead of straight to Parliament. The Labour party has not proposed that in the past, nor is it what Governments do. Governments consult, introduce proposals in a White Paper and then put them in legislation before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East raised two points—I am glad that he is, as usual, listening to my words with rapt attention. He said that the national issue could not be ignored. I have never disputed the fact that if people want a Scottish Parliament, there is a perfectly easy way to achieve that: they should vote for his party in sufficient numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
The hon. Gentleman also asked me a more detailed question about the internal management and structure of local government in Scotland. We produced a consultation paper following a working group involving myself and the president of COSLA, which considered a range of issues. A number of recommendations following that consultation are contained in the Bill, including those on education and social work, which we shall discuss in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that what he has produced is as good as the Paterson report? Does it deal adequately with the management structures and has it made appropriate recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have moved on from that report. The document was produced by a joint working group of COSLA and the Scottish Office under an overall committee, which jointly agreed that the consultation document should be published and that the Government should receive comments on it. That area is much less controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North made a most penetrating contribution when he pointed out the paradox of the Labour party's call for an independent commission for the restructuring of local government in Scotland although it proposes no such body to precede the radical restructuring of the United Kingdom constitution. If the Labour party were to win the next election, that restructuring would go ahead in the first Session of Parliament without any consultation, because otherwise Labour would not be able to do it in the first Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Kilbrandon commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have moved on since the Kilbrandon commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate began with an admission by the hon. Member for East Lothian, so I shall end on that. We have continually wondered why the Labour party supports single-tier local government only if there is a Scottish Parliament. It has never been clear why a Scottish Parliament is required before the creation of a structure of unitary authorities. We presumed that it was because the Labour party intended the Scottish Parliament to take over some of the functions of local government. We have not been alone in that view. I refer Opposition Members—they may not be listening to me—to a quote from Jean McFadden, who is well known to.them. In 	<i>The Herald</i> on 6 March 1992 she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think we must be very much on our guard here. There may well be a tendency for the Scottish Parliament to suck up power from below."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow, in his excellent book, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government of Scotland and Wales would become more rather than less centralised and … local government would be the losers."</p></blockquote>
In its policy document, "The Future of Local Government in Scotland" published in February 1990, the Labour party argued that it would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"resisting the centralising of existing local government functions upward to a Scottish Parliament."</p></blockquote>
That was the policy in 1990; it is not the policy today. It was quite clear from the remarks of the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
East Lothian that he envisaged some powers of local councils going to a Scottish Parliament. The hon. Member for Hamilton in no way endeavoured to dissuade him from that view.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 18, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"; except that on receipt by the Secretary of State within one month of the passing of this Act of a petition signed by 20 per cent. of the electorate in a ward or combination of wards requesting that they be part of a different and adjacent local authority, a referendum shall be conducted by the existing local authority to ascertain the wishes of the electorate and the majority decision shall then be implemented.".</p></blockquote>
I say to the hon. Member for Stroud that the only interest that I wish to declare is that I have served in local government. I therefore appreciate its worth and I wish to defend it to allow it to continue to contribute to the Scottish people and to our communities. Local government is worth fighting for and defending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes a recall referendum on boundaries when people are not satisfied with the Government's or Parliament's final proposals. It is a tidying-up amendment to allow local action rather than major restructuring. It would not make it possible to change whole districts—that would be determined by the schedule and the Committee—but it would allow wards adjacent to another authority the opportunity to seek a review of boundaries before they were finally locked into an authority with which the majority of the people in a ward were not happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to deal with local hot spots—those areas that are not satisfied with the boundaries and think that they should be part of another authority. It would allow them to have a say in their future. It is a reassertion of democracy, allowing the people to speak about the boundaries that they want rather than them being determined by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major problem with the Government's proposals is that they are seen to be their proposals. They have produced a partisan map that has been devised to suit the Government. It is a diktat and there has been no local
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
consultation, participation or agreement. That diktat, however, will be foisted upon people. Some of the amendments on boundaries will reflect that view as hon. Members seek, on behalf of communities, to make larger changes to the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow for more localised democracy. Within one month after the passing of the Act, it provides that, where the final boundaries are fixed, individual, localised concerns about wards can be given voice and acted upon. The fact that it is within one month of enactment means that there will be no unnecessary delay, but it allows time for agreed pockets of population to let their views be known and be acted upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman and following his argument with great interest. Could he help me and other hon. Members? Did he take the same view about the referendum proposals relating to the Bill on the Maastricht treaty? Did he vote for a referendum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tempting though it is to take that road, the Chairman would rule me out of order if I went down the highways and byways of the Maastricht debate. I have never been afraid of consulting the people. That is the basis of my proposal. In a democracy it is only fair and sensible that the people are consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A petition expressing 20 per cent. approval would prevent frivolous applications and ensure that the anxiety felt is widespread. It is important to know what the people in the wards feel and want. A consequent referendum would allow true participation in deciding on a localised basis which authority a specific area wanted to join.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not consult in depth or widely before producing their local government boundary map. There has therefore been a hurried consultation with councils, councillors and people. The amendment would allow redress of the most flagrant of incorrect, centralised decisions and permit the people a say in the future of their local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Altering boundaries in Committee is a lottery determined by numbers. I would happily be proven wrong and would like to discover that the Government have suddenly listened to reasoned argument and introduced a number of changes. I could say now, however, which amendments and boundary changes will be accepted. We are taking part in a lottery and the people have not been consulted. If ever a Bill needed a shot of democracy, it is this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be shot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said slightly more than I would, but I am tempted to agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's edition of 	<i>The Herald</i> reported a speech by Brian Parnell, visiting professor at Strathclyde university's centre for planning, who discussed anxieties about the Bill and the boundaries proposed by the Government. Professor Parnell called the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"an affront to democratic principles without parallel since the demise of the pocket boroughs in England".</p></blockquote>
He awards it the description of the best gerrymandering since 1831 and expressed the worries felt among the Scottish public. Will the Minister take that into account?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
The amendment tries to give voice to that concern where it is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people will agree with Professor Parnell
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a political wish to favour Conservatives enclaves with autonomy had corrupted the proposals".</p></blockquote>
The professor believes that a
	<br><blockquote><p>"complex and internally inconsistent system"</p></blockquote>
has been produced, and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed groupings around Glasgow, for example, had no apparent logic based on settlement patterns, geography, or size of population."</p></blockquote>
I have not met Professor Parnell, but know what he means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the full report of Brian K. Parnell Associates. Those of us who know Professor Parnell know that he is most effective. His report is devastating. Will the Government make a serious reply to it? The critiques mount and mount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made the fan-point that many questions are not being answered. I hope that the Government will take the professor's comments on board, lock on to the criticisms and respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has not been proper and widespread consultation, which has meant that the boundaries have thrown up anomolies. My amendment examines problems on a specific and localised basis. It would give the people a democratic say in achieving a better community mix. The amendment is fundamentally based on democracy rather than the Government's diktat.

Referendums are precedented and have been acceptable to previous Governments. There is no reason for the Government not to agree. They have found referendums acceptable, not just on national questions, but for sounding local opinions. Such a sounding is proposed in the amendment. I remind the Committee that ward or area referendums over licensing used to be fairly commonplace. People were asked to give their democratic opinion about the future of licensing provision in their areas. The public were trusted to display common sense. Their opinion was taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the effect of such referendums was limited to the area in which the voters lived? The problem with the amendment is that it would have consequences for people living outside the relevant area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be the initial effect, but how can areas that feel aggrieved because their views are not represented make their voices heard? The referendums proposed in the amendment would give people the opportunity to state their views about an adjacent authority with which they share a sense of community and to which they might prefer to belong. I have described the sort of hot spots in which people feel aggrieved. I am trying to establish a democratic mechanism to allow their opinions to be recognised and acted on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would mean that people in Kirriemuir, for example, could say that they did not wish to become a part of the new Angus authority and that they preferred to belong to the adjacent Perth and Kinross authority. However, the people in Forfar would
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
have no say in the opinions of the people of Kirriemuir, or Monifieth. The result of the amendment could be that Angus district would lose its peripheral wards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anything is possible, but the hon. Gentleman's ludicrous suggestion is not on the cards. Kirriemuir has always been part of Angus. Its people would not want to change allegiance. Other areas, however, have been put in with authorities with which they share no history or sense of community. The people in such areas must be given the chance to have their say and to have it acted on. They must have a mechanism through which they can express their democratic opinion. They have been trusted in the past to arrive at sensible solutions. I mentioned referendums over licensing. If people can make such decisions sensibly and democratically, should not they be trusted with the more important matter of local boundary allocations? Aggrieved communities will have no way out once they are locked into the system dictated by the Government. I am trying to offer them a democratic way out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the wording of the amendment would make it possible for Glasgow, which is a combination of wards adjacent to Eastwood, to decide to be considered a part of Eastwood? If Glasgow could vote to amalgamate with Eastwood, Edinburgh could vote to amalgamate with Midlothian, then to amalgamate with West Lothian then with East Lothian, with the result that the Lothians would be recreated. The amendment is interesting, but that scenario, I am sure, is not what the hon. Gentleman had in mind. The amendment therefore needs to be redrafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be possible, if that was what the people of Glasgow wanted. It is a strange view of democracy for the hon. Gentleman to want to deny Glaswegians that right. However, large boundary changes are covered by schedule 1. This amendment would allow people in the small areas to express their opinion democratically. It would allow them to leave arrangements into which they have been locked by the Government without consultation or agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility outlined by the hon. Member for Govan would be difficult to organise, but it would be a true reflection of the position in the larger areas. It is not democratic to gainsay the democratic voice of the people of those areas. My aim is to find a solution to problems caused by the Bill. My proposed referendums would be conducted on a local basis by the local authorities involved following receipt of a recall petition by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The idea is not new—Scottish local authorities have organised referendums recently on nuclear dumping, for example. They have trusted the people, who have responded by stating their views in a democratic fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment offers a democratic solution to what is otherwise a straightforward Government diktat. It is important to allow those who will live with and be most affected by the new system the opportunity for democratic expression of their views.

In a land governed by unelected quangos, the amendment would allow some redress, action and voice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
to the people whom a democratic system is supposed to serve. The principle of the amendment is to provide an opportunity for democratic expression in a Bill and a system which is, in many ways, the opposite. It creates unelected organisations and places them in control of people's lives. If the Minister does not agree with the amendment, I should like to hear how he intends to allow democratic expression to the people in these specifically aggrieved—if not widespread—communities, to whom his map is currently dictating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will respond briefly to the amendment of the hon. Member for Angus, East. He may be sincere in saying that the amendment is meant to apply only to individual wards which are adjacent to larger authrorities, but that is certainly not what the amendment says. It simply refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the electorate in a ward or combination of wards".</p></blockquote>
There is no mention of adjacent authorities. Therefore, the scenario that he described would not apply if the Committee were foolish enough to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that it would be possible for Glasgow district council to vote to become part of Eastwood district council, therefore recreating a larger Glasgow district council. The same would be true of Dundee district council. The combination of the wards in Dundee district council could vote to become part of Monifieth and then say that as they have a bigger population than Angus and Mearns, a bigger council is necessary. We could then all vote to become part of Perth and Kinross, and then reinstate the Tayside regional council. If that is the amendment's intention, I might have some sympathy with it, but I doubt whether that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would happen if Monifieth which, under the present proposals is joining Angus and Mearns and may be quite happy with that, were suddenly gobbled up by Dundee district council which is growing and growing? Why stop at Tayside regional council? Why not expand and take over the rest of Scotland as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Scottish Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, a Scottish Parliament. Perhaps such a Parliament would be brought about by individual wards getting together and gradually spreading their influence over the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must consider the detail of the amendment's wording. It is completely unsuitable, and members of the Committee would be insane to support it as it stands. It would be a recipe for the kind of madhouse to which the hon. Member for Angus, East referred. I am sure that in his reply, the Minister will point that out to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy with the amendment's proposal of a trigger mechanism of 20 per cent. in just one ward. When a referendum is held in that ward, the amendment simply says that the majority decision in that referendum must be implemented. The amendment makes no mention of what the turnout of the referendum must be. We could have 20 per cent. of people in a ward voting for referendum and then only 20 per cent. need take part in that referendum. Of that percentage, 10 per cent. plus one
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
vote could vote to move from one council to another. That seems absolute madness. It is open to political abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting a rerun of the 40 per cent. rule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly the opposite. If the hon. Gentleman thinks about what he is asking the Committee to do, he will begin to recognise the foolishness of his amendment. Scottish Militant Labour is not a mighty force in Scottish politics at the moment. We should not write off anyone, however, years ago the Tories and the Liberals made the mistake of writing off Keir Hardie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Militant Labour has four seats in the Glasgow area. It is confined to certain wards in that area and is unable to break out. It is not inconceivable that it could start to win wards in the local authority areas that surround Glasgow district council. Irrespective of the efficiency of services and the good of the area, its members may, for purely political reasons, decide to join their comrades in Glasgow district council. If Scottish Militant Labour won a seat in Aberdeen, under the amendment it could express a wish to become part of Glasgow district council and even carry the referendum for which the amendment makes provision. The amendment does not specify that wards have to be adjacent to the larger local authorities; applications can be made to join any council in all parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should stick to the provision for changing boundaries that is described in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. That allows a boundary commission at any time to change the boundaries of a local authority. All that is required is for the local authority or for an individual to apply to the Boundary Commission, which will then consider the request. That happened not long ago in Dundee when Perth and Kinross applied to the Boundary Commission that Longforgan should be taken out of Dundee and put back into Perth and Kinross district council. On receiving the application, the Boundary Commission consulted all the bodies that would be affected, including Dundee district council, Tayside regional council, Longforgan community council, Fowlis, Liff and Benvie community council, Invergowrie and Kingoodie community council and the Members of Parliament in the area. After listening to all the arguments, the decision was that Longforgan should remain part of Dundee district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Longforgan community council was unhappy about that and applied for a review of the decision, stating that there was overwhelming support in Longforgan to leave Dundee district council. The Boundary Commission was prepared to listen and appointed an assistant commissioner—Mr. James Dunlop, CBE and justice of the peace—who held a public meeting in Longforgan town hall where he listened to evidence from all parties with something to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After careful consideration, Mr. Dunlop concluded that the feelings of the local people could not be the sole criterion for deciding whether the area should belong to one or another council and that other criteria had to be considered, such as geographical location, travel-to-work arrangements, education, medical, shopping and recreation facilities. He pointed out that Dundee was the major shopping centre for the area and that recreation, hospital, industry and education services were all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
provided to the people of Longforgan from Dundee. He emphasised, most importantly, that of those who travelled from Longforgan to work elsewhere, 71 per cent. went to Dundee and so had access to services there. Taking into account all those factors, the conclusion was that Longforgan had to remain within Dundee district council. The Tory Government agreed with that decision at the time, but they have now said that they disagree and want Longforgan to become part of Perth and Kinross, which their independent commission said would be a bad move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East is sincere in his intentions, but his amendment is a piece of nonsense and the Committee would be mad to accept it. If the hon. Gentleman wants to protect small communities, he should do so by supporting the independent commission procedure and not through his madcap ideas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the wise words of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. Although there is sympathy for some of the ideas, of the hon. Member for Angus, East, the amendment is clearly not the best mechanism for implementing them. In line with our argument about the need for reviews when considering communities, I have a suggestion, which I hope that the Minister will bear in mind and, perhaps address, in the interests of Scottish unity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 20 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 provides for an initial review of electoral arrangements and local government areas. That is a specific and useful power. The 1973 Act was drafted after lengthy consultation. Schedule 5 of the Act defined the terms of reviews. That provision was welcomed and useful to hon. Members. The Bill is different. Clause 166 effects schedule 13, which,
	<br><blockquote><p>"contains minor amendments and amendments consequential upon the provisions of this Act".</p></blockquote>
Among the proposed minor amendments is a deletion of a reference to an initial review of areas in section 20 of the 1973 Act and the substitution of new schedule 5, which will omit any reference to an initial review of the areas. The provision for a review in the 1973 Act was sensible. There was more consensus about the definition of local government areas in 1979. There has been little consensus expressed about the Bill—it is outrightly opposed by many. Would it not be appropriate to include in the Bill a provision for an initial review of areas? That would solve sensibly the problem that the hon. Member for Angus, East identified. The Minister could satisfy the Committee by tabling an amendment to that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with most of what the hon. Members for Hamilton and for Dundee, East said. I am sure that the Committee sympathises with the objectives of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Angus, East. The amendment is unworkable, however, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Dundee, East outlined. I assure him and the hon. Member for Hamilton that the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland has a power and a duty under the 1973 Act to review boundaries. I assure that Committee that those powers will continue to exist. I take the point about a possible initial review. I shall consider that point and present the Government's proposals later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East revealed surprising megalomaniac geographical

ambitions. Reduction to absurdity is an old trick, but not necessarily the best one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Hamilton for his positive suggestion. The Minister has undertaken to consider the point further. I made a simple point about democracy. We are confronted with a battery of unelected quangos, and centralisation of Government powers; the Bill proposes fewer elected councillors, a massive amount of secondary legislation and boundary changes, which suit Tory political convenience. The amendment tries to facilitate a return to democracy. It would allow people to participate in decisions. I make no apology for lighting a small candle in the wind for democracy. I hope that the Minister will do as he says and reconsider the matter. I look forward to the results. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your wishes, Mr. Martin, for tight, distinct speeches have wafted through to me somehow. I seek clarification of the potential cost of the proposed reorganisation of local government. Given the debate on those costs in recent weeks, it would be useful to establish the plausibility of the Government's estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper asserted that the findings of the Touche Ross report can still justify the assertion that reorganisation would provide significant savings. The criticisms levelled at the report from a wide range of respected bodies cause considerable anxiety that the hopes for savings from reorganisation may not be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COSLA report is only one of a number of critical reports. Do the government seriously dispute the basis of that report? One of the main criticisms of the Touche Ross report was the mistaken attribution of operational staff and indirect staff. That is, an inappropriate assumption was made that staff over a certain grade would be management or indirect staff across the full range of local government functions. It has been shown that that resulted in a major overstatement of the numbers of indirect staff. Do the Government dispute that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
A specific study that has graphically highlighted this overestimate was carried out by Pieda for Central region council. Touche Ross's own methodology and survey were used by Pieda to relate Touche Ross's Scottish findings to a specific set of councils. Pieda compared a detailed assessment of Central's indirect staff with an estimate that was produced by the survey form used by IPF on behalf of Touche Ross. That comparison showed that Touche Ross's methodology overestimated the number of indirect staff by a factor of two. Such a weakness in the methodology will have an obvious impact on overall cost benefits that reorganisation will produce across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is now widespread acceptance that a single tier structure of local government has the potential to yield significant savings in terms of cost".</p></blockquote>
Pieda agreed with the broad thrust of Touche Ross that fewer councils will produce long-term savings. However, Pieda concludes that the costs of the Government's proposals have been greatly underestimated, and the savings overestimated. It estimates that substantial savings would arise only if the number of unitary authorities were 25 or fewer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pieda has therefore presented a more detailed view than Touche Ross of how the costs and savings of reorganisation may turn out. The findings have major implications for the presumed savings that reorganisation will bring nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister three questions. First, do the Government accept Pieda's analysis of the situation within Central region? Secondly, do the Government, therefore, accept the fundamental weakness of the Touche Ross report that I have identified? Thirdly, have the cost estimates produced for the White Paper been amended to take account of the weaknesses of the Touche Ross report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If COSLA's figures are not accepted, what is the Government's figure and on what basis was it arrived at? Finally, I want other members of the Committee to receive as soon as possible the promised letter on the costs of information technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few substantive words. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I know that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will rightly disagree if I say that I have been sitting here quietly. I have made some sedentary interventions, but they represented my frustration at the way in which things have been proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been on a local government Bill Committee since the early 1980s because I have been dealing with different parts of the world, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton. In the old days, I was used to dealing with the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), when he was the local government Minister. He dealt with things swiftly and efficiently. He listened to what was said. If he disagreed with us, he told us why. Even though I did not agree with him, I thought that he dismissed the arguments effectively. When he agreed with us, he accepted the argument and he responded positively. That is the way we should operate in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a good friend of the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I have even shared a glass of
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
beer with him—well he had one half pint and I had another. I appreciate him as a human being, but I honestly think that so far in Committee—I hope that he will change—he has not dealt with the issues raised by Opposition Members about clause 1 with the seriousness and expedition that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Falkirk, East, for Glasgow, Govan, for East Lothian, for Linlithgow and the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen have raised important points succinctly. They have asked specific questions, but they have not received the answers. The purpose of the Committee is to obtain answers. We can have great debates and make rhetorical arguments on the Floor of the House or in the Scottish Grand Committee, but on this Committee we should get down to the detailed issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard rehearsals of some of the boundary arguments that we shall have later. That is unfortunate because I hope that we shall debate them in detail. I hope, Mr. Martin, to catch your eye when we come to the debates on Ayrshire so that I can make the case for an all-Ayrshire authority. I shall not do that now, because we shall have opportunities to do that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr gave the game away. He is refreshingly and disarmingly honest. He gave the game away when he said that the Bill was boundary driven. That really infuriates Labour Members. The Government decided that reorganisation should take place long before it was necessary and before there was a demand for it. I confess that I agree with single-tier authorities. I know that the two-tier system has its defenders, and it is an arguable way forward, but I agree widi all-purpose, single-tier authorities. I served on one widi the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scodand, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) in the old Edinburgh corporation. It had many advantages. People knew diat dieir councilors had responsibility for all services. They came to them confident that diose councillors would deal with them in dieir area. Each local government service was dealt with by the corporation's councillors. You, Mr. Martin, having served on Glasgow corporation, will understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened is that the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood has decided, with his colleagues, that Eastwood—or East Renfrewshire, as it will be called—is sacrosanct, as is Stirling, which is represented by the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), one of the architects of the poll tax and other things alien to Scotland. He gained his local government experience in England. The local government experience—such as it is—of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland was gained in the borough of Bromley. He knows things from an English perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened is that the Eastwood laager, or redoubt, has been set up, as have the Stirling and Berwick and East Lothian laagers, and, most disgraceful of all, the south Ayrshire redoubt—that little part of Ayrshire that, because it was Conservative-controlled before, as now, although it has also been Labour-controlled, the Government hope will become the future home of conservatism. The whole structure of Scottish local government has been determined by those personal and political interests, which is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is important. So many issues, including people's livelihoods and their future, depend on our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
discussions. It is wrong that it should all begin from the political and personal interests of a few Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. May I put it to you that paragraph 43 of the document that I mentioned earlier relating to personal and financial interests was not admissible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I did not allow the hon. Member for Stroud to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. You were right. I had not mentioned pecuniary interests declarable in the Register of Members' Interests. I spoke of Conservative Members' personal and political interest and their political future looking after people in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another source of astonishment has been the fact that, although the Minister is aware of our policy, he averred not to be. He knows full well that the Labour party does not favour local government reorganisation now. As the Bill has gone through Second Reading and reached its Committee stage, however, we must face the realities, examine the boundaries and make proposals, although it is extremely difficult to suggest changes that would make sense of a Bill which, fundamentally, is nonsense. Again, when we try to make sense of a provision, the knock-on consequences are also nonsense. There is no strategy, philosophy or organisation in this restructuring pattern for local government; nor is there any determining of the areas, as Wheatley determined them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You were around in local government, Mr. Martin, and will no doubt remember the time of Wheatley. He considered not only the one-tier and two-tier arguments but the estuarial principle. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow knows that because his father-in-law, one of the most distinguished politicians ever in Scotland, chaired the Wheatley commission. It did an honest, non-political, non-partisan job. Betty Harvie-Anderson was one of its members, as was the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston). Non-political people were also members. They examined the two-tier system as opposed to the one-tier system, and the estuarial principle but, above all, they examined the optimum area that could best provide services such as education, social work and roads for the people efficiently and effectively. That has not been done on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No account has been taken of the effect of reorganisation on people. Everything has been done for party-political and partisan advantage. No account has been taken of the delivery of services. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East can sit in the Opposition Whip's seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned, Mr. Martin, about ordinary, fit, or relatively fit people, such as you and me, who can look after themselves, but very concerned about the mentally and physically handicapped, the elderly and the disabled, and about the provision of services to them. The Government have given that no consideration. If they had, they would have examined the optimum size of local authorities and not made them small enough to return Conservatives in four or five redoubts in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow, but is he seriously suggesting that there is one optimum size that is ideal for a local authority in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, quite the reverse. That would be ideal if Scotland was a uniform country, but it is not. Scotland has a central belt that is heavily populated and the Borders and the highlands that are not. A pattern that takes account of that is needed, and Wheatley went into great detail about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there can be different authorities. If I catch your eye later, Mr. Martin, I shall argue the case for Ayrshire, but I would not necessarily think that its size was the optimum for other authorities. Account must be taken of physical size and remoteness, but that has not been done. The arrangements are arbitrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members look at the maps, they will see small and large authorities in densely populated areas, and small and large authorities in rural areas. I want to mention East Renfrewshire in particular. You, Mr. Martin, and the Minister will know why. Strathclyde regional council produced an excellent briefing and I pay tribute to its work. It has been greatly maligned. I may have wee quarrels with the council, but I know of the dedication and commitment of Strathclyde councillors and officials. The briefing states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current East Renfrewshire area currently contains no residential resources for children, accommodation for the mentally ill, or hostels or other accommodation for the physically handicapped."</p></blockquote>
To provide that, the new authority will have to make arrangements with other authorities or build. Would not it be better if it were part of an authority with such facilities and of an optimum size that would enable it to provide accommodation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to use the same sort of arguments again in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority. I was involved in local government from 1970 to 1979, when I came to the House. Brian Meek's column from 	<i>The Herald</i> has been quoted by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I once had to be constrained from writing a letter to the paper stating that I agreed with Brian Meek. I thought that that would be too dangerous as it could be used against me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Brian Meek writes sense sometimes. When he was a councillor in Edinburgh in Lothian, he looked after his people's interests. He was dedicated. Conservative councillors, such as John Young, do the same. The Bill is an insult not just to dedicated Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors, but above all to good Tory councillors who have worked hard and think that the boundaries are being gerrymandered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gerrymandering is taking place for all the wrong reasons. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton said, we will make the best of it because that is the Opposition's job. We oppose the principles, but in Committee we will try to ensure that the interests of the people whom we represent, especially the vulnerable people, will be protected once the Bill reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting, but untidy debate. The Government have failed to realise that it is essentially about issues that they have ignored. It is about cost and about the need for

	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
independent scrutiny of the case for reorganisation. It is about the argument for constitutional change—the proper context for reorganisation. The amendments support the status quo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue is who wants the reorganisation. We have yet to hear the Government's case. There is no consensus for change in Scotland; the key quality of the Wheatley deliberations and the final report is that it represented a consensual process. Massive changes were introduced. The commission took submissions from a variety of organisations. It took between eight and nine years to determine what was wrong with Scottish local government and made serious proposals about the best way to deal with services, boundaries and finance. That is not the case with this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments tried to extract from the Government an ounce of a reason why we are in this Committee when there are so many other problems facing local government and the social and economic fabric of Scotland. Why do a Government with a £50 billion public sector deficit want to spend money on a reorganisation that no one wants, which will add to the burden of taxpayers in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April, every family will have nearly £1,300 a year added to its outgoings. Do they really deserve to have to meet the extra costs of this monumental folly? English members of the Committee must be told that, in Scotland, people will have to face the same tax increases as those in the south and that the Scottish people will also have to pay the gerrymander tax. Is that fair? Would it be fair even if the reorganisation was a sensible way to proceed? Insult is added to injury when Scots have to pay for an unwanted reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not hike council tax bills to pay for the reorganisation, where will the money come from? That is why we raised the matter of costs. We heard in the debate that COSLA argue that it will cost up to £720 million. The Government, understandably, have stuck to a figure of £200 million for transitional costs. But whether the figure is £720 million or £200 million, it is a burden too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot identify savings: the country is facing a massive economic crisis. We need to save cash if possible but the Government are hell-bent on spending more money and making no savings. The burden will be borne by council tax payers or by cuts in services and jobs, which is equally worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 300,000 people working in local government and £7.5 billion of taxpayers' money is spent on it every year. The 5 million consumers in Scotland, who enjoy some of the best services available, deserve better than this Committee's deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled amendments to the clause—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Government Whip shakes his head; I am not sure whether he does so at my speech or at the mail with which he is dealing. He may be reading a letter that he has just received, as I have, about the Borders, a subject which will arise later. I apologise if I have interrupted a flow of thought, Mr. Martin, and I apologise to the Whip. It would be unique if a Whip intervened in a Committee debating a Bill. It seems that he is quite happy not to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued about the lack of a case, consensus, a commission, constitutional change and about the fact that
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
no adequate examination of costs has been made. The Government have not specifically responded to our anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends raised another important matter. What are the opportunity costs of this monumental folly? They are about not tackling crime, which is endemic under the Tories. They do not relate to care in the community, a vital service that needs resources. Are we to believe that we can spend between £200 million and £700 million on a reorganisation that does not provide an extra service and, at the same time, starve the police, social services and health authorities by cutting cash? Of course, the real tragedy in Scotland is housing. It must be repeated that an extra house will not be built within the context of this reorganisation Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Govan highlighted an inconsistency. Any serious report would examine the services to be provided, the financial structure within which that could be done, and would then examine the boundaries. Yet, as we see from the Bill, it is boundaries first. As my hon. Friends have said, it is boundary driven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham spoke about buying in services. Scotland does not want a boundary-driven Bill which favours one party; neither does it want small authorities such as Kyle and Carrick, Stirling or East Renfrewshire to buy services that they cannot provide in-house. Is the Committee to believe that child care—an issue from which, in the context of legislation, the Government have run away—will be put at the mercy of the marketplace?—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Oh, yes; this is a revealing Committee. The hon. Member for Hexham is now getting instructions, with a smile from the Minister, to hold his tongue. I believe that he just said that child care should be put at the mercy of the market. My hon. Friends would consider that to be utterly disgraceful. We need a child care Bill but the only Government approach seems to be to buy services from the market for children. Anyone examining this debate will make his or her own judgment about what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the consensus issue is important. This reorganisation cannot endure without it. The Opposition parties have told the Government that there is no support for the changes. Many organisations in Scotland say exactly the same. Does any Conservative Member believe that these reorganisation measures, if they go through, will endure? They simply cannot, because they do not command the popular support of the Scottish people or of the key organisations in Scotland, including political parties, that are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the consensus issue is vital. Surely to goodness the Minister and his colleagues do not want the Bill to go through all its various stages here and in the Lords only to find at the end of the day that a Bill that is not wanted will not endure. That is lunacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled to clause 1 have been designed to tweak out of the Government some rationale for the misery that they will inflict on the 300,000 local government employees and the consumers of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall vote against the clause, because it is damaging. The Bill is unwanted. We believe that if Conservative Members had enough sense of the reality of Scotland they would join us in voting against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the course of the debate on clause 1, we have had a number of reasonable speeches from Opposition Members. That was not one of them.

	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
I shall respond first to the perfectly reasonable points made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. He asked about the difference between the Scottish Office and the Pieda models in relation to Central regional council. I have a note of the differences in front of me, which I am happy to read out. I am equally content, if the hon. Gentleman is content, to write to him about those rather technical matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to have them read out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. The Scottish Office and Pieda models agree with option 2 in the report—that is, having two unitary authorities. It has about the same on-going cost savings as the White Paper proposals. Both models produce very similar additional on-going costs for the option of three unitary authorities based on the existing districts of Stirling, Clackmannan and Falkirk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow specifically referred to option 1 which covers Central region. The Pieda model produces greater on-going savings than are implied by the Scottish Office model. The Pieda model would save £6.6 million, compared with up to £4.4 million that the Scottish Office model would save. The Pieda model reflects a view that greater economies of scale can be obtained by a single-tier Central authority, but the figures are in the same ball park, if I may use that non-technical expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked again about the timing of my letter to him on information technology confirming in detail what I said this afternoon. He should receive that letter tomorrow. I also owe the hon. Gentleman another letter on points that he raised on the COSLA report. I am hopeful that the work that the Scottish Office statisticians are doing will be completed in time for him to receive that letter tomorrow as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As will other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman raised a point of order about that, perhaps it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I confirm that I shall copy my letter to him to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say to the other members of the Committee who spoke that of course there can be differences of view over the timing of costs and benefit. The opposition to the Bill in principle is surprising, however, because all the Opposition parties have, in one way or another, been committed to a unitary system of single-tier authority. There is no question about that. Therefore, the difference between the Government and the Opposition parties is not about the principle of the Bill, or the principle enshrined in clause 1, but about the way that the system is implemented in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a considerable debate on clause 1. Hon. Members have rightly flagged up a number of points to which we shall return during our proceedings on the Bill's 168 clauses and 14 schedules. For the moment, I commend clause 1 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be one of those times when the more that one learns about a proposal, the less one likes it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is no way to describe the hon. Member for Angus, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not describing people. Awkward facts have a habit of emerging. A difficulty has arisen today from the speeches of the hon. Members for Tayside, North and for Ayr. I hope that I have not misunderstood, but they said that increasing the number of councils would save money. There may be small savings in many areas, but there are problems with the three expensive areas of social work, education and roads when the number of councils is increased. When one splits Strathclyde into 10 for those expensive items one gets into trouble with the kind of argument that I took both hon. Gentlemen to be deploying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his points to which we shall doubtless return. I am sure that the Committee agrees that there is no one more expert than the hon. Gentleman at digging out awkward facts. We look forward to his further contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As well as moving amendment No. 4, which relates to Westhill, I want to speak to amendment No. 6, which deals with the southern part of Kincardine and Deeside district. I shall try not to detain the Committee for long, but, inevitably, I shall have to explain some of the geography of the area, which might help the Committee in its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 relates to two wards in the current district of Gordon. Let me explain my interest because, obviously, the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) is the hon. Member representing that area. Under the parliamentary boundary reforms currently in draft form, the area of Westhill and some other areas of Gordon are likely to be grouped with the largest part of my constituency, Kincardine and Deeside. Therefore, I have an interest as the people there are likely to be my future constituents, or those pn whose doors I shall be knocking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that he cannot anticipate the decision of the Boundary Commission? The amendments are bogus because we do not know whether Westhill will be part of his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not anticipating the results of the Boundary Commission's report. This part of the proposals was not disputed at the inquiry held in Aberdeen. I am local to that area, and as one of the two local Members on the Committee, I feel qualified to talk about the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to map 2. Westhill is a small town some seven miles from the centre of Aberdeen. It was developed in 1972. In map 2, Aberdeen city is the darkened area surrounded by green. It stretches out along the north Deeside road, which is the main road to Braemar along a ribbon development that includes Cults, Bieldside, Milltimber and Culter, sometimes called Peterculter. Westhill is separated from the city by some four and a half miles of green belt. It is a developing community, which has grown to be self sufficient. The town is used by many in the rural community beyond and around it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly approve of, and support, the Secretary of State's intention to have city authorities totally separate from rural authorities. The interests of cities and of rural authorities are not necessarily compatible. There is a strong reason to have separate authorities. The question is whether Westhill is part of a city or part of a rural authority. It is currently part of Gordon district, which is a rural authority. The city boundary of Aberdeen city district, as it currently stands, runs quite close to Westhill, but as the map shows, it is largely a green-belt area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited Westhill a couple of weekends ago when one of its most recent acquisitions was opened, although I did not attend the opening ceremony. The Ashdale community hall, a new hall for the village, was funded by
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
Gordon district council. I was very impressed because although I knew that it was a young town which had grown significantly since 1972, even I had not appreciated how many facilities it had. I struggled to think of a reason for people from Westhill to go to Aberdeen, except for employment. It is usual for any city to have travel-to-work areas around it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was shown the modern secondary school, I wondered where the primary feeders for that secondary school were. They lie within Westhill: one lies on the rural side of Westhill towards Edit. Its education system is self sufficient. It has an hotel and an 18-hole golf course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is advancing an extremely convincing argument. Is he suggesting that it is important to have primary school feeders in the same local authority as the secondary school? If so, that is a convincing argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman has said, but I shall not fall into his trap. There will obviously be cross-boundary schools, but if the education system in a rural area in a large rural authority can be self sufficient, so be it. The Bill provides for cross-boundary funding of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to its own schools, Westhill has a full-size swimming pool, squash courts, bowling green and all the facilities that anyone could want. Before the hon. Gentleman's intervention, I mentioned Westhill's golf course. It is an 18-hole golf course, which is situated in the middle of the town. I tried to see Aberdeen city to the east from the top point of the course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, to the right—it was to the left because I was facing south, which shows that my geography is reasonable. I struggled to see Aberdeen city: it was over some hills and I could just see the top of a couple of fiats in the far distance. Westhill is, therefore, totally self sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend seriously arguing that Westhill is wholly self sufficient from the city of Aberdeen, socially, economically and culturally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing that, as far as I am aware, Westhill does not draw on Aberdeen city for any services. In fact, the only purpose for which people might consider using Aberdeen city is to dine out in the evening. I asked several people where they would go if they wanted to go to a restaurant. Westhill has its own restaurants—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is an awful lot of background noise.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I thought that I was competing with the background noise quite adequately, but thank you for your assistance.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
I thought that people would go to the city of Aberdeen if they wanted to go out for an evening meal. On many occasions, people in Westhill visit the rural restaurants and hotels in my constituency. I thought that it might be worthwhile to go round those restaurants to see whether I could get a subsidy for advertising them in the Committee, but I decided that perhaps I would have to declare an interest and therefore it would not be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I inquire about the dining habits of Aberdonians? Do they go to Westhill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. When I was in the hotel in Westhill, I saw a couple who I suspect were shortly going to get married.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How could the hon. Gentleman tell?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I thought they needed some encouragement, but in fact they were trying to book the function suite in the hotel. I asked the manager whether the function suite is used a lot. Apparently, it is used regularly by people from Aberdeen and booked well ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strong point to. consider is the local community's wishes. Since the White Paper and the publication of the Bill, the local community has tried to gauge local opinion. A petition was delivered in November which was incredibly successful from the local community's point of view. Some 4,785 signatures were collected: only 77 abstained and 98 per cent. of the electorate contacted said that they wanted to remain—I use that word carefully—part of a rural authority. They are currently part of Gordon district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the people who organised that petition, which they presented it to me, if they go to houses asking people to sign a petition, unless they have strong views against it, most of them will sign to get the person off the doorstep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can use that argument. However, in this instance, and bearing in mind that it concerns a rural authority, the message was loud and clear and has remained so since across all party boundaries and religious denominations. The churches have been involved because the proposed boundary would break up a parish that has existed for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I back the hon. Gentleman 100 per cent. The Minister is being cynical. Petitions that are gathered in rural areas about the setting up of a local authority should be given great weight. I support the hon. Gentleman's view completely and I hope that he will bear that in mind in future debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not usually receive support from the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, but on this occasion I accept it with gratitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that any such petition would have to cover 100 per cent. of the relevant area and achieve something like 98 per cent. support, as previously suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is also interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to proceed because I do not want to detain the Committee too much longer. I conclude my remarks on Westhill by pointing out that the map shows it to be isolated from the city by a large stretch—some four and a half miles—of agricultural ground to its west. It stands as a little island on the left of the green patch on the map that represents the proposed city of Aberdeen. That is why we urge that it should be included in the rural authority and not brought into the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should include in my remarks Kincardine and Deeside, which is particularly important to me. Some misconceptions have existed about where local loyalties he in Kincardineshire. I know that the parliamentary constituency was at one time North Angus and the Meams. One could therefore have imagined that the Mearns part of Kincardineshire, as it is colloquially called, was looking south towards the north Angus part. However, the River North Esk has been a boundary of Kincardine and Deeside district and Kincardineshire for about 1,000 years. It is at the southern boundary of Kincardine and Deeside district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the intention behind the Bill, it is useful to refer to the White Paper, which mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"local loyalties, community links and accountability."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm the hon. Gentleman's point. The north Angus part of North Angus and the Mearns was, previously, part of the old Angus boroughs. Kincardineshire has always been a unique, distinct entity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. I could go into the history of Kincardineshire, but I do not propose to do that, although I will happily give more details after the Committee to anyone who wants to study that 1,000-year history. The important matter is to consider the point where the line is now drawn. That is just south of Stonehaven, which has, for many years, been the local government centre of that part of the region. Stonehaven is not only the district centre, with the appropriate infrastructure, but also the centre for the regional divisional headquarters covering Kincardine and Deeside district. I propose that as we consider the Bill, we should take into account existing, operating infrastructure, and try to use it to the best advantage to minimise the costs of transition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way for the last time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not wish to take up the Committee's time for longer than necessary.

Stonehaven is on the proposed boundary of rural Aberdeenshire. There is a large school in Stonehaven called Mackie academy, which has 1,100 pupils. Between 400 and 500 of them are drawn from the area to the south of Stonehaven, and they would be covered by a different authority. I am aware that there are provisions for cross-boundary funding, but such funding would be of a greater magnitude than was intended by the existing measures for flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider the area south of Stonehaven and the Mearns, which was the original name for the whole of Kincardineshire. It stretches right up to Banchory. Only recently has the Mearns referred to the southern part of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
the country. Over the summer I was approached by many people—I have passed the letters to the Minister—who feel strongly that traditional Kincardineshire, which has been in existence for 1,000 years, should be kept intact in the new rural authority of Aberdeenshire. Medical practitioners have referred to their catchment areas for patients. Schools and businesses have also made representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to refer to community councils. They play a large part in the Bill because they must be consulted on planning matters. The Minister is a firm advocate of that. I did not try to persuade anyone, but I asked for the views of the community councils that I represent. They all said that we should keep Kincardineshire intact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I looked at the most southerly community council at St. Cyrus, which is just north of the River North Esk, I thought that it would take the view that it wanted to be a part of Angus. However, it did not do that. The chairman of that council wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Very strong concern was raised at the meeting and people in the community are very unhappy at the proposal to split Kincardineshire and Deeside and to bring the area south of Stonehaven into Angus. St. Cyrus along with the area north of the river North Esk has always been part of Kincardineshire and people in this area would be extremely distressed to see this tradition broken."</p></blockquote>
Further inland along the southern boundary we come to Fettercairn. The Minister has not seen it, but I have a petition signed by 252 people from Fettercairn which is headed by the signature of Jan Buchanan Smith, the widow of the late right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. The petition, drawn up in the post office in Fettercairn by Forbes Robertson, managed to cover virtually the whole village.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must be honest and point out that I received two letters from people who wished to look south towards Angus. One was from someone who had a grudge against the district council because it failed to provide lighting outside his property. I do not know the reasoning behind the other letter, but I think that it was from someone new to the area. Apart from those two people, everyone wants Kincardineshire to remain intact. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the succinct, straightforward and concise way in which he expressed the concerns felt in Westhill and Kincardine and Deeside. I subscribe to the argument that he has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Government claim to be serious when they say that Parliament is the place to decide such issues. Therefore, we should support the hon. Gentleman and I have added my name in support of amendment No. 4. If the hon. Gentleman does not receive satisfactory assurances from the Minister, he should follow logic and press the issues of Westhill and Kincardine and Deeside to a Division.

	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the arguments of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, and especially the plea that he and other members of the Committee received from the residents of Westhill. the Minister met a constructive delegation of residents from Westhill, led by my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). The residents found the exchange of views useful and an opportunity to reinforce their points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the delegation was made up of residents, not party political councillors. I was disappointed that the Minister seemed to dismiss the petition, which my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon presented to Parliament on 25 November. All the electors in the electoral divisions of Westhill were approached and asked for their views. Of 4,862 people, 4,785 signed the petition. There were 77 abstentions. Those figures show a lot of support. I appreciate the Minister's remarks about petitions in the middle of market squares, where the world and a man passes by and forms are thrust under people's noses. Some people sign just to get away and minimise the inconvenience. The Westhill petition is different. A deliberate and successful attempt was made to canvass views from all parts of the community. It is not right to dismiss that petition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the amendment has enormous, strategic significance. However, it is important to local people. It would not cost the Government much to concede the point. The people of Westhill believe that they are part of a distinct community. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside made that clear in his remarks. Twenty-nine per cent. of the work force work in Gordon, not Aberdeen. There is a strong sense of identity in Westhill. That would be difficult to sustain if Westhill was lumped in with Aberdeen. Westhill does not consider itself to be a suburb of Aberdeen. It is a distinct, detached community. There is a substantial green-belt area between Westhill and the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Westhill are worried that they would lose out on services if they became part of the city. Some places act as commuter bases for Aberdeen. Westhill does not want to become such a place. The residents took the initiative, raised a petition and made representations. They received support from all parties. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside and my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon, among others, have supported Westhill. If local democracy is to be meaningful and if the local community is to be sustained, it would be inappropriate to leave Westhill in an urban local authority while putting it in a rural constituency. The point made by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside is not insignificant. The parish would be disrupted if the proposed changes were implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that that detail about the church can be resolved easily? Is not the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside about where people have dinner in the restaurants less significant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside was trying to establish social patterns. As a piece

	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
of anecdotal evidence it was reasonable and insightful. All such elements build up a jigsaw picture. Whether people whom the hon. Gentleman meets on the street are getting married is not particularly relevant, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people in that small community feel that they have a distinct identity. The Government should not deprive them of the ability to develop that sense of community. They deserve nothing less. It would cost the Government nothing to concede the point. I hope that the Government will consider the powerful and positive case presented by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside in connection with Westhill, and with Kincardine and Deeside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the first to admit that there is some debate about the boundaries of new city of Aberdeen authority. However, the Committee should be in no doubt that the concept of a single-tier authority for Aberdeen has been welcomed in the city by every political party represented in this Committee. On the morning after the publication of the White Paper, the Aberdeen 	<i>Press and Journal</i> carried the banner headline "Aberdeen Achieves Goal". That was on 9 July 1993. It was not a reference to the football team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every political party in Aberdeen favours single-tier authorities—except for the Labour party, which is tied up in hopeless knots over the matter. Labour's councillors and political establishment in Aberdeen have long campaigned for a single-tier authority in the city, but they got into trouble with party headquarters in Glasgow. On 19 August 1993, an editorial in the Aberdeen 	<i>Press and Journal</i> summed the matter up. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The idiocy of certain little cliques in local government will be illustrated never better than with this afternoon's likely decision by Aberdeen District Council to boycott plans for a single-tier authority.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If it goes through … it will be a hilarious about-turn from official Labour policy for the last 20 years, and render Labour councillors the toom tabards of their day.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>So far, the ruling Labour group has campaigned actively for one-tier local authorities. Indeed, a senior Aberdeen Labour group at an interview in 1991 insisted that the Labour group would continue to fight, fight and fight again for single-tier government.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Now, with that in sight, courtesy of Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, the brothers (and sisters) are not so sure. Suddenly, single-tier authorities are not all they are cracked up to be. Pardon us. A hasty, 20-year mistake."</p></blockquote>
The demand for a single-tier authority in Aberdeen spans all parties and comes from all sectors of the city's community. The proposal to include Westhill has been criticised. Comparisons have been made with other towns and localities in the area. Perhaps the most eloquent case for the inclusion of Westhill was made by the former independent convener of Grampian regional council. Councillor Geoff Hadley became convener on the votes of Liberal and SNP councillors in the Grampian region. He wrote in the Aberdeen 	<i>Press and Journal:</i>
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the 25 years since Aberdeen County Council fell in with the developers … Westhill has grown and been variously described as a garden suburb, dormitory town and satellite town—all terms which imply a population shunt between home and work locations.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But this is not simply commuting. I would guess that perhaps 90 per cent. of Westhill residents' activities associated with work, cultural affairs, social events, sport, shopping, and so on, relate to the Aberdeen City locus. Few will look to Inverurie or other towns in Gordon District for promoting their lifestyle.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Given this, is there not a certain illogicality in the declared reluctance of Westhill's residents to become part of Aberdeen?".</p></blockquote>
That man represents Peterculter, a commuter community very similar to Westhill. It is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made certain comparisons and referred to various distances. Peterculter, which is already part of the city district, is 7.3 miles from the town house. Another commuter—Dyce—is 7.1 miles from the town house. The boundary of Westhill is 7.2 miles from the town house. Therefore, Westhill is closer to the town house than Peterculter, which has been part of the city since the most recent reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the green belt. However, he neglected—or forgot to say that the green belt is currently within the city boundary. The boundary of Westhill is only 700 yards from the city boundary. I was very intrigued to learn that my hon. Friend was on the 18th hole of the golf course and could not see 700 yards away. However, I understand that at his age, one's eyesight is not as good as it is for someone of 34, like me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maps show that including Westhill means that the proposals almost arc off the city. At the north-west boundary at Hatton of Fintray, the current boundary is 9.25 miles. On the western boundary at Leuchar Moss it is 9.75 miles and on the south-west side at Moss-side it is 9.5 miles. The furthest western point of Westhill lies only eight miles from the town house—comfortably within the arcing off of the city boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Westhill is not included in the city, we will be creating what Opposition Members are prone to describe as a democratic deficit. The people of Westhill, whose fives are dominated by the city of Aberdeen, will have no input in the city's decisions. They will be able to vote about pavements in Inverurie and street lighting in Echt. If my hon. Friend's amendment is accepted, which I sincerely hope will happen, they will be able to vote on libraries in Stonehaven. Yet they will have no input into the decisions of a city that dominates every aspect of their life. That will create an unhealthy democratic deficit. At present, given the two-tier structure and the fact that Westhill is represented in the region, at least the people there have some input into the life of Aberdeen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is good on technical details such as miles and distances, but when the hon.

I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer, because when we adjourned for the Divisions, I was told on three occasions by Opposition Members that I should be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motives of those who support the "Don't Move Westhill" campaign are suspect. They want the rights and privileges of the city of Aberdeen without the responsibilities. They want services without paying taxes. The motives of the Don't Move Westhill campaign are at best naive but—much more likely—dishonest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are the proof of the pudding. We have gone from general debate to discussing specific issues and places. The pace has hotted up. Now is the time for the Government to prove that they are a listening Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 12 and 13 and make the case for Banff and Buchan as a new unitary authority. Created in 1974, it wants to continue serving its community. If the Bill passes unamended, Banff and Buchan will cease to exist. Therefore, it is useful to record the flavour of its many achievements to help to make the case for its continuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banff and Buchan is the land fall for nearly half of the United Kingdom's gas resources. It is home to a quarter of Scotland's fishing fleet. Industrial statistics show that Banff and Buchan has a strong economy. For example, gross domestic product per head of population is far higher than in many other authorities that have been retained by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want to use economic strength and economically strong geographical areas as the building blocks for the new system, Banff and Buchan more than fulfils the criterion. It more than passes any test of community identity. There is a clearly identifiable community spirit and a community of interest throughout the district. Banff and Buchan is an identifiable, natural area that offers a strong unit of local government. It passes the tests with flying colours, and is not an artificial creation, such as Aberdeenshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government, I hope, accept the break up of the Aberdeenshire proposal, they should recognise that Banff and Buchan is a sensible and natural unit. I am happy to note that my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) is listening to my comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He certainly does exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
The Banff and Buchan proposal has the overwhelming support of the local community. It has the unanimous backing of all councillors of all parties on the district council. It shows the proof of the pudding of my amendment that dealt with asking the people. A referendum was held in Banff and Buchan, polling 3,332 people across the district, and 94 per cent. wanted a continuation of Banff and Buchan as a unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have received notification of support for the proposal in the representations that they received from Banff and Buchan. A unitary council would serve an area with a strong local identity and a shared community of interest—a prime Scottish Office requirement. It has the correct balance between population mass and land area. Banff and Buchan is the right size to create truly local services that would be sensitive to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banff and Buchan's economy is stronger than those of many areas that, according to the Government's proposals, are to benefit from having their own councils. The Scottish Office objectives for the creation of Scotland's new unitary councils have been met. I ask the Minister again to examine the case for what would be an excellent district council that is well fitted to continue as one of the new unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments relevant to Kincardineshire. It would be easy for me to try to extend the territory of Angus as, by virtue of geography and population, Angus could dominate the proposed Angus and Mearns authority, but that is not my wish. I want the best solution for both populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kincardineshire is a district, unique and identifiable community. It has a long, distinguished and proud record as a local government entity with a strong established identity. The local population favours continuing that proud history of local government under Kincardineshire. It naturally looks northwards, not southwards towards Angus. In all surveys of opinion, the people of Kincardineshire have clearly expressed their wish to retain their distinct identity and I support them in that. If the Government go ahead with Angus and Mearns in spite of the wishes oflocal people, so be it, but the people of Kincardineshire will have to live with the consequences of the Government's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for Angus is rock solid. It has a unique history of community and of local government services working for its people. Therefore, in the interests and with the wishes of the people of Kincardineshire and Angus, I ask the Minister to accept the amendments and to allow the existing communities to continue to grow, thrive, prosper and retain their unique identities as strong local government authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendments Nos. 4 and 6 to which the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside spoke and which are supported also by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North. The case has been put lucidly and sensibly. It is interesting to note the comments of the Minister and of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South. They can be regarded in only two ways: either their theatricals mean that they will vote against the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside or, by pretending that their theatricals are genuine, they will turn the hon. Gentleman into a local hero by letting him have the glory. We hope that the hon. Gentleman gets the glory because the amendments are sensible.

It would have been useful to have been given maps of the old Aberdeen city boundary as that would have put into sharp focus for the first time the gerrymandering that we are encountering. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside is right: a look at the map shows conclusively that Westhill, for example, should not be included in the city, but should be part of the rural area. There is no argument about that whatever. It is illustrative of the fact that, over the next few sittings, we shall discuss many attempts to gerrymander boundaries. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, supported by my hon. Friends, has seen through the Government and is willing to stand up and be counted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let the people of Aberdeen see it on the record that when I mentioned the fact that all the parties in Aberdeen are in favour of a single-tier Aberdeen council—my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South rightly referred to that in his resolute defence of the interests of the people of his city—the hon. Member for Fife, Central laughed.

I am fully aware also of the controversy surrounding the Government's proposal to divide Kincardineshire between the Aberdeenshire and Angus and Mearns authorities. That was to be expected. The proposal was no less controversial at the time of the previous reorganisation. History forms a strong part of the case for retaining Kincardineshire as an entity and including it within the new Aberdeenshire authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside made those points and received some support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stop praising the hon. Member for Angus, East for his reasonable speeches. That will get him into immense trouble with his hon. Friends. However, he did make a reasonable speech. Nevertheless, there are strong grounds for including the southern part of Kincardineshire—broadly the area to the south of the highland fault line—in the new Angus authority. Wheatley recognised the merits of such a proposal after long and careful deliberation. In some respects, this area looks south rather than north, and the settlements there seem to go naturally with the Angus towns of Montrose and Brechin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, made it clear from the outset that we would be listening to reasoned arguments in relation to our boundary proposals. We have had an interesting debate. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am glad that the hon. Member for Dundee, East found it interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from correspondence that I have received from my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside and from the hon. Member for Angus, East and others that the people of Kincardineshire attach great importance to retaining the former county as a single entity, albeit within a larger authority—as indeed it is at present within Grampian region and Kincardine and Deeside district. Therefore, I commend amendment No. 6 and the associated ones to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the case for a Banff and Buchan authority, I listened carefully to the points made by the hon. Member for Angus, East. I am, of course, aware of the local support that has been expressed by the district council and public opinion for that option. I am also aware of the fact that the proposed Aberdeenshire authority will cover parts of the former Banffshire as well as its former area. I do not think a sufficient case has been made to justify the creation of a separate authority in Banff and Buchan. In proposing, a new authority covering much of the former county of Aberdeenshire, we had to balance a number of sometimes conflicting arguments and devise a structure that would best meet the needs of the north-east as a whole. I must say that the response to our consultation paper "Shaping the New Councils" included support for a structure based on existing district boundaries, but other options were considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that reasonable people can have a different view of the matter, but in the light of the evidence we concluded that the city of Aberdeen should become a single-tier authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South has argued that case powerfully to the House and the Committee. We also decided that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
should be a neighbouring Aberdeenshire authority to act as a reasonable counterbalance. We were keen to avoid the situation that obtained prior to 1975 when, partly due to their size, the cities tended to dominate some of their smaller neighbours. The structure that we have proposed for the north-east, including Banff and Buchan, recreates much of the former county of Aberdeenshire with a population very close to that of the city. I do, of course, recognise, as the hon. Member for Angus, East noted, that Aberdeenshire covers a large area stretching from the Cairngorms to the north-east coast. However, several existing authorities have operated successfully with a mix of geographical features and community interests. I am sure that Aberdeenshire will soon develop a strong and powerful identity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What objections have been received in the Scottish Office about the cost of transforming Grampian region into Aberdeenshire? What is the estimated cost of unpicking Grampian region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, different people have made different estimates of the cost. The submissions received by the Scottish Office from the Labour-run Aberdeen city council and from the present district councils in Grampian region show that the overwhelming consensus is that a structure involving councils for Aberdeen city and for Aberdeenshire as a whole would be very cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the structure that we have proposed, if it is amended in the Mearns, will best meet the needs of all the people in the new authority's area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we assume that the Scottish Office relies entirely on evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, from other bodies? Has it not formed its own projections of the cost of unpicking Grampian region? Some of us are deeply suspicious that the costings have not been done properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, our cost estimates and those of CIPFA and COSLA are on a Scotland-wide basis. The estimates to which the hon. Gentleman refers are on a similar basis. It is not unreasonable when we are discussing amendments relating to maps of specific areas of the north-east of Scotland to refer to evidence from councils and other bodies. That evidence shows overwhelmingly that it would be sensible and cost-effective in Grampian to have a structure based on the city of Aberdeen and an Aberdeenshire authority.

The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside relate to Westhill.
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
There is a good case for our proposals, expressed not only by the Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South referred earlier this evening and on Second Reading to sources wholly unrelated to the Government which support our case. The Labour group on the City of Aberdeen district council states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Portlethen and Westhill function to a significant extent as dormitory suburbs of Aberdeen. In social and economic terms, they are very much part of the overall activity patterns of the city."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South rightly referred to the view of Councillor Geoff Hadley, the former independent convener of Grampian regional council. He was not a paid-up member of the Conservative party. He was quoted thus in the 	<i>Press and Journal</i> on 9 September 1993:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the 25 years since Aberdeen County Council fell in with the developers … Westhill has grown and been variously described as a garden suburb, dormitary town and satellite town—all terms which imply a population shunt between home and work locations."</p></blockquote>
That is Geoff Hadley's view, not the Government's. I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside that Councillor Hadley goes on to dispute the arguments that my hon. Friend put to the Committee earlier. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South that there are substantial and concrete arguments to support the case that he made in his excellent speech on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point, will he give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to refer to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, if I may continue. The hon. Gentleman has taken a particular interest in the matter on behalf of his hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) who led a delegation that came to see me with a petition. I entirely accept that the delegation was non-political. The people who came to see me did not seem to have any political axe to grind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were untainted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will rephrase that: of course they had a political axe to grind, but they did not seem to me to have a party political axe to grind. They put forward a reasoned and responsible case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am about to finish. The hon. Gentleman has the option of speaking afterwards if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to the Committee the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside, relating to the Mearns. I cannot accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Angus, East, relating to Banff and Buchan. On balance, I commend the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside, relating to Westhill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some wonderment among my hon. Friends, which could be easily assuaged, about where all the headquarters are to be. Are Aberdeenshire's headquarters to be in the city of Aberdeen or outside the area? If not, where will they be? I am alarmed because it appears that the Minister does not know. That suggests
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
that the questions have not been thought through. I become more and more suspicious about costings. I could be very easily shut by the Minister if he would tell me that the headquarters will be at, for instance, Ballater, Aboyne, Alford, Huntly, Turriff, Mintlaw or wherever. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, but we are dealing with a sensitive and difficult issue, because it seems that headquarters will be outside the area of representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back to the old story of Midlothian county council, which had to have its headquarters in Edinburgh. That caused much dissatisfaction and some of us have experienced it. I ask directly: what is the thinking about headquarters? Has the question of property and its attendant expense been thought through? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The answer is the proverbial lemon. I am afraid that it has not. I am very suspicious about the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I accept the decision of my hon. Friend the Minister, I also accept the feeling in Committee. I shall not be seen to divide the Committee, but I reserve that right and want the matter to be brought up again on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The Minister has suggested that he will accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, and the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South has said that he is prepared to accept that. However, I listened carefully to his speech, which was powerful and passionate. It would be in order for the hon. Gentleman to divide the Committee on the relevant amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that that is a matter entirely for the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
