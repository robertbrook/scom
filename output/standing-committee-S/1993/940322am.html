	<time>Tuesday 22 March 1994</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (SCOTLAND) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I wish to raise the issue of the behaviour in Committee of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). It is not a criticism of hon. Members on the Opposition Benches in general, but the hon. Member for Linlithgow continually refers by name to civil servants who assist Ministers. We have checked 	<i>Hansard.</i> There is no doubt that that is not a slip that any hon. Member can easily make, but a deliberate policy and deliberate defiance of the Chairman, who has raised it with the hon. Member for Linlithgow again and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish the hon. Member for Linlithgow to be replaced by another Labour Member because of his policy of deliberate defiance of the Chair. Can you advise us, Sir James, on how we can—legitimately and in order—go about that? Is it a matter for you or for the Committee of Selection? We should be grateful for your advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minster for his point of order because it allows me to remind hon. Members that they should not refer by name to civil servants, to anyone else in the Committee who is not a member of the Committee, or to civil servants outside the Committee Room, in the Scottish Office and elsewhere. I have mentioned that from time to time to the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I do not believe that he does it intentionally. He regards everyone as coming within his constituency and that is why he mentioned such matters. It is important to follow the tradition that hon. Members must not refer by name to civil servants as they cannot respond to criticisms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I do not think that I have ever been sustainedly discourteous to the Chair. The Government's complaint is really that I have done what I am perfectly entitled to do in writing a long private letter about the behaviour of Ministers to the permanent secretary at the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman writes a private letter to someone, he should keep it private. The membership of the Committee is a matter for the Committee of Selection and has nothing to do with the Chair, thank goodness. I am fortunate in the membership of the Committee. I have no power to change and would not wish to change any current member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1316</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I endorse your views that members of the Committee should not refer by name to civil servants. Not only is that a tradition, but they should not bear responsibility for this ridiculous Bill and all its ramifications. Therefore, it is right and proper and sensible that they should not be referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is your recollection, Sir James, the same as mine? First, this morning a Minister of the Crown reminded the Chair of the Chair's responsibilities and implied that the Chair has been remiss in conducting the Committee. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] That is clearly what the Minister implied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, is not it unprecedented for a Minister of the Crown to say in a Standing Committee of the House of Commons that a member of the Committee should be removed and replaced by someone more acceptable to him? Surely, that would open a brand new book of procedure. Ministers would decide which Opposition Members are acceptable to them. Does not that venture into the territory of the Committee of Selection, which we debated fully during our first sitting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I did not suggest that the Government were in control of the membership of the Committee. That is not a matter for the Government. Will you, Sir James, confirm that on a point of order I simply asked for advice from the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can respond to the Minister by agreeing that he asked for my advice. It is rare for anyone to do that, so it was a novelty. The other issues are a matter of political argument: they are not matters for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. The Minister's previous comment was disingenous. If he had wanted advice from the Chair, he could have easily approached you, Sir James, or Mr. Martin in private. Was such an approach made? In addition, the Minister gave me no notice that he intended to raise this issue. That is a bit strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am curious to know what the complaint is against me. Was it because I named two distinguished civil servants—I will not name them again—even though I did not do that maliciously? I have a high regard for the civil service. My track record has been that of one of the most sustained defenders in the House of civil service values and the civil service. Alternatively, is the complaint against me that I asked questions about the Secretary of State for Scotland's political adviser and his activities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now, may I say that it is time to make progress? I have been waiting with eager anticipation all weekend to taking the Chair to discuss this important Bill. Let us settle down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a separate point of order, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should get on, but I will hear a separate point of order. I hope that points of order will not blight my morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1317</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I thank whoever is responsible for putting bottles of water on the Back Benches. That is an example of persistent pressure from those on the Back Benches paying off in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I regret that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) is not present, because he made the arrangement. I want to record my thanks to him for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I have just seen the Government Whip pinching the bottle of water from the Conservative Back Benches and, thus, depriving the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) of sustenance for the rest of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will, obviously, be a fight over the water before long. I shall not get involved in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 51</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>TWEED FISHERIES COMMISSIONERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 233, in page 44, leave out line 12 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"new council for the Borders.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 180, in page 44, line 12, leave out "councils for Berwickshire and East Lothian and" and insert "council for".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
and Government amendment No. 234.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This relates to more important water than that which hon. Members were just discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the River Tweed and its commissioners in relating to the changes that were made in schedule 1 to remove East Lothian from the areas concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: East Lothian may have been removed from the clause, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will still be able to catch a few fish in the Tweed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tweed is one of the most important rivers in Scotland, but it is covered by unusual legislation—the Tweed Fisheries Act 1857 and the Tweed Fisheries Act 1969. The River Tweed Council comprises local councillors, riparian owners and others. Those individuals become the Tweed commissioners and look after the river in place of a district salmon fishery board, which is the body applicable to almost every other important river in Scotland. They have important powers and responsibilities for the management of the river and are very effective. Because of decisions about the Borders district, made during consideration of schedule 1 of the Bill, East Lothian must be removed from the jurisdiction of the River Tweed Council. Amendments 233, 234 and 239 accord with the earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>1318</span>
changes to schedule 1. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has tabled a similar amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). Those hon. Members want East Lothian to be removed from the Tweed commissioners, for the practical reason that the council boundaries are to be changed. The amendments are in effect drafting measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much to be said about the amendments, although I should like to make a few comments on clause stand part, if we reach that stage this morning. Perhaps you, Sir James, if not the Minister, could clarify the difference between amendment No. 233 and amendment No. 180, apart from the fact that the Government amendment was tabled later than that tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and me. I drafted the amendment. The purpose, wording and consequences of the two amendments are exactly the same. Amendment No. 180 flows from the earlier amendment to schedule 1, properly removing East Lothian from any connection with the Borders. The later amendment is superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of the River Tweed Commissioners graphically illustrates the absurdity of the Government's original intention of cobbling together a new, artificial authority, straddling the watershed—straddling the Lammermuir hills—and giving councillors from East Lothian some say in decisions about the River Tweed, a far-away river of which they know little—except perhaps for a few constructive nights' work for which the miners might occasionally have nipped down there. By and large, the Tweed is a long way from those councillors, on the other side of the hill. The river has nothing to do with East Lothian. I welcome the consequential amendment, which happily consigns the very idea of a Berwickshire and East Lothian local authority to history for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 234, in page 44, line 16, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"Berwickshire and East Lothian Council and".—	<i>[Sir Hector Monro.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More substantial issues affecting Scottish water will be debated later, but it would be wrong for the Committee to pass by a clause about the River Tweed Commissioners without saying something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, at the outset, declare an interest as the proprietor of a few hundred yards of tidal Tweed in which a person would be extremely lucky to catch anything with a rod. I have enjoyed occasionally helping people to land fish by net, which is the traditional way of fishing that stretch of the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was briefly a member of the River Tweed Commissioners, nominated by Berwickshire district
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1319</span>
council, of which I was a member before I was elected a Member of Parliament. My brief spell as a member of the River Tweed Commissioners gave me an insight into the way in which that body operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government are prepared to reflect on the constitution of the River Tweed Commissioners. I cannot remember the exact proportions, but the split between riparian owners and direct representatives of such owners—who own fishing beats on the Tweed—and commissioners representing local authorities and angling associations and clubs 50:50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That constitution might create the illusion that the River Tweed Commissioners and the decisions made about the management of the fisheries on the River Tweed, such as who pays what and who has access to what are subject to democratic control. Of course, it does not work like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is another example of the way in which the representative commissioners—who represent angling clubs and, in this case, local authorities—are forever changing whereas the riparian owners' representatives are there for all time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the commissioners, and those who call the shots and make decisions about the management of the river, are, practically always, the riparian owners—the proprietors of the fishing beats on the River Tweed. Such people have never paid much attention to the case for improving public access to fishing or improving the management of the river and its fisheries in the interests of the public and, to a lesser extent, of environmentalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with the entrenched position of riparian owners on the River Tweed. It is a curious river because a significant part of it forms the border between England and Scotland. It has a hybrid status, but in legal terms is a Scottish river, despite the fact that part of it is in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation governing the river goes back hundreds of years and is long overdue for a major overhaul. The way in which the River Tweed and other Scottish rivers are managed should be changed. They should be subject to proper democratic accountability in the interests of the public—not just of the rivers' owners—and of environmentalists. It would be helpful if the Minister addressed those important points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the thrust of the argument of my hon. Friend the Minister for East Lothian. The Minister knows the area and has a genuine interest in the wider issues, not just the balance of fishing interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A welcome, thoughtful and thought-provoking study has been carried out through the United Kingdom-North America Countryside Stewardship Exchange, which set out a wider strategy for the River Tweed. That did not bring home to me that there was anything desperately wrong with what has happened in the past—I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian who knows more about past events than me—but that we must look to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not casting aspersions on anyone in particular, but we must look to the future more progressively and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1320</span>
more broadly in terms of potential development. Such a strategy does not apply just to Scotland; the management of river has many implications for north Northumberland, especially the communities served by Hexham, for example, because they have almost direct access to the river. It is a shame that the Government have not given that more thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the Bill is not a suitable vehicle for pursuing this matter, and that the Government have plans to integrate tourism, consider access to the public and to control such access so that there is a proper balance. They could consider how the fisheries can be developed and how the interpretative centres could be brought on-stream. They could consider the role and function of the proposed Tweed centre. That is an important and useful initiative, which could be taken much further in terms of its future potential. There is also the question of the educational value for local schools on both sides of the border. They could benefit tremendously from this natural resource, even though it is not made proper use of, or exploited in a way which, while it preserves its natural environmental context, does more than simply preserve the traditional balance between the riparian owners and the fishing clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much that could be done. Even if the Minister says only that the Government are aware of such matters and are dealing with them through other routes, I should be reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to respond to the hon. Members for East Lothian and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, who have raised the broader aspects of the issue. As they appreciate, the Bill is not the right vehicle in which to discuss the detailed administration of the River Tweed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The source of the Tweed is very nearly in my constituency. I regularly pass the sign on the top of the Devils Beef Tub summit for the source of the Tweed. It is a magnificent river which flows from there to the North sea, and the scenery which surrounds the vast part of its length is magnificent. We should not underestimate the importance of the Tweed to Scotland's economy and environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served on the Committee considering the Salmon Act 1986 and fought a rearguard action to ease the difficulties facing Tweed fishermen by the effect of the north-east salmon drift net off the east coast of Northumberland. I am glad that such drift nets are to be phased out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that the effect of the north-east drift net is felt on rivers further north. Anything that he can do to accelerate the phasing out of drift nets would be much appreciated by many salmon fishermen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would urge the Minister not to get side-tracked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am running against the current, I know, but that is an extremely important issue and salmon fishermen appreciate the problems that are accentuated by the north-east drift net. I am glad that it is being phased out—13 per cent. went this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1321</span>
It is estimated that 4,500 fishermen come to the river every year, contributing about £5 million to the economy of the Tweed Valley. I am very glad that there is a Tweed centre. The local tourist board will do all that it can to promote the river, which has a worldwide reputation as one of the finest rivers for fishing salmon. Orders made under the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976 provide the opportunity for angling for trout and other fish at a much lower cost. In that way, anglers can participate in inexpensive fishing as well as the much more expensive salmon fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gladly tell the hon. Members for East Lothian and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that I strongly support promoting the River Tweed and ensuring that its fishing returns to the higher standard of quality and quantity that it had some years ago. I believe that recent steps taken by the river purification boards, and the reduction of some fixed netting on the Scottish coast, will help to increase the river stocks. I assure the hon. Members that I shall do all that I can to promote the river and I hope that it will maintain its tremendous worldwide reputation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his expressions of good will towards the future of this important river. I stress that it is vital that management of a river such as the Tweed should be in the interests of the wider community, including local residents, visitors, tourists and everyone else. It should not be managed almost exclusively in the interests of people like the Duke of Roxburghe who make a lot of money from letting rod-fishing beats on the Tweed at exorbitant rates, which means that local people simply cannot take advantage of them. The river should not be as exclusive as it is, but I agree with the Minister that it should be protected; the salmon and sea trout are an important natural resource and an important aspect of Scotland's natural environment.

The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) made a predictable comment about the north-east drift net fishery, which I shall not discuss as that would be out of order. We have seen such things before, when legitimate traditional netting operations in the Tweed estuary were destroyed and people lost their jobs because of collusion between Government regulations and the efforts of a pseudo charity fronting the interests of riparian owners. Nothing like that must happen again. Any decision should be made according to genuine scientific evidence rather than on blind prejudice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to the general subject involved when we discuss clause 138, which is an interesting provision; the Government propose to derate fishing rights, giving one exclusive and already privileged group of people a little backhander by derating their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a powerful case for a fresh approach to legislation on the management of important rivers such as the Tweed. I agree with the Minister that the Bill is not the right vehicle for that. I look forward to the day when we can provide that fresh approach and when the Government stop snipping away at the rights of local communities and undermining the river's potential for the tourist industry. There are far too many privileges
	<span class='label label-info column'>1322</span>
for riparian owners on rivers such as the Tweed. It is time to change that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. As a matter of courtesy to the Committee—which the Minister did not show to me—may I say that I have just talked to Sir Clifford Boulton, the Clerk of the House, about the suggestion that I should be removed from the Committee, with a view to obtaining advice on the best way to pursue the matter? It would be courteous of me to say that rather serious issues arise when a ministerial suggestion is made that a member of the Committee—however adequate or inadequate he may be in his work in Committee—should be removed from the Committee. The matter is being considered by the Clerk of the House, who will obtain a report from the Clerk of the Committee. We shall see where we go from there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian and I are both interested in promoting the River Tweed. I am speaking off the top of my head, but when considering any legislation that related to the River Tweed Commissioners, we should have to examine closely current legislation. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there are 81 members of the council, 43 of whom are appointed by the local authorities. That sounds rather a large number to look after a river, even one as important as the Tweed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is a large number. Although, theoretically, the majority of representatives are democratically accountable to the local authorities and angling clubs, the riparian owners always run the commissioners. The Minister can confirm that the chairman of the commissioners has always been a riparian owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is useful information. That has not been true on all rivers. On some district salmon boards the netting interests have been in the chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my previous position before I came to this place, I served on the River Dee fisheries board.

I would assume that the Tweed river board is much the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Tweed council, and therefore the commissioners, have a much wider remit than the normal district salmon fishery board, which is usually quite a small organisation. The Tweed council is very large with 81 members and is responsible for the whole of the River Tweed. That was decided in the middle of the last century. At the other end of the border where I live is the River Esk. Its last three or four miles are in England, so it has to be run by an English organisation, the National Rivers Authority, whereas in Scotland it is run by the Tweed commissioners, even though the mouth of the Tweed is in England. There is a compromise between one and the other; of course the Tweed is a much more important river.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1323</span>
the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is one of those days. I am not clear why the Government have not taken the opportunity offered by the Bill to look at the constitution of the salmon fisheries boards. I have had many dealings with the chairman and secretary of the river Ayr salmon fisheries board. It is related to the clause because if we are dealing with the Tweed fisheries commissioners, now is the time to ask why the salmon fisheries boards have not also been dealt with in this Bill. There are strong pressures from the angling and fishing clubs on the river Ayr and other rivers for changes to be made in the constitutions of salmon fisheries boards to make them more democratic and to get a greater involvement from local people. I wondered why the Government had not taken this opportunity to look at reconstituting those boards as well as the Tweed fisheries commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is quite big enough. The Tweed commissioners must be dealt with because of the change in the composition of the local representatives. At this stage we do not want to go into reconstituting the district salmon fisheries boards because by and large, whatever the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley says, they work pretty well. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr agrees. They have improved the quality of fishing in Scotland enormously. If only we could get more salmon stocks to come to our rivers and subsequently spawn we would have more fish to catch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come later in the Bill to the issue that the hon. Member for East Lothian raised about sporting rates. He must realise that it may affect some people more than others such as the owners of the junction pool or perhaps some of the splendid beats below Kelso such as those which flow in front of Paxton house. The river must be looked at as a whole, as must its importance to Scotland's economy. We must attract fishermen to the best fishing available in Scotland. There are swings and roundabouts, because some will gain and others will lose. Ultimately it is the overall economy of the Tweed valley and the development that fishing brings to an area such as hotels, ghillies and all the tourist-related activities that are of the highest importance. It is therefore right that the work of the Tweed commissioners, through the Tweed Fisheries Act 1969, is continued, which is why I hope that the clause will stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I welcome the appearance of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), and the prospect of Ministers speaking off the top of their heads, which is a novelty and a welcome relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1325</span>
Saunders, who has figured prominently in our debate, is considering standing as an independent candidate because of the Government's desire to drive through this crazy reorganisation without due regard to some of their party members. A nod of your head, Sir James, is enough to make me move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent opinion polls about local government reorganisation are germane to the amendment. Clause 52 relates to archives, a subject which has hit home to the Scottish public. There is tremendous concern about what will happen to our public records, and the clause gives us a chance to provide some information in the Committee. There is a mood of optimism in Scotland that this crazy reorganisation Bill is running into major problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unison has published a survey that damns the reorganisation of local government that is proposed in the Bill. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> has published a poll that has damning implications. A poll in this morning's 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> shows that there is no interest whatever for this crazy reorganisation. That brings home to me the fact that the people of Scotland—concerned as they are about archives and public records—would want me to put on record the anxieties that they have expressed in opinion polls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 52 raises serious issues about records. The fear that we have constantly expressed in Committee is that this crazy Bill is being bulldozed through at breakneck speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says from a sedentary position that he wishes that it was. The Government clearly want to get the Bill through. It is a bad Bill, which will upset Scottish life and destroy services. As a backdrop to all that, we shall have to look at how the new councils will deal with records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in an era when we do not trust the Government to handle anything—the spectre of privatisation and of contracting-out affects everything they are involved in. The first point that we should like to stress through the amendment is that, at the very least, we expect significant assurances about the security of information in records. That is a big issue because records held by local authorities are important and confidential. There is obviously concern that security may be affected by the transition from the present, sensible system to the new system of unitary councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue, which I have touched on briefly, is what will happen to records in local government generally. Our fear is that it will be a case of, "What you see is not what you get." The prospect of 30 councils is bad enough. However, if we then consider the to-ing and fro-ing between central Government and the councils and between contractors and the unitary councils, and bear in mind that some services will have been privatised, we see that all of that will involve records of one sort or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like an assurance that the Government do not expect any record-keeping work to be exposed to contracting out or to any of the forms of privatisation that we have seen in Scotland. It is well known that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1326</span>
Government are obsessed with selling anything to the private sector, regardless of the public consequences. The Opposition regard that as reckless and irresponsible, although we have come to live with the Government, who show those characteristics day in, day out. We must have a firm guarantee that there will be none of that ideological nonsense with records and their future. That is why the amendment mentions "professional custody".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I have just looked at the amendment and I seek your guidance as to whether it is in order. It is printed with a full stop after the word "custody". From my reading of the clause, such an amendment would not make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, mistakes occur even in mother of Parliaments. That is what is known as a minor misprint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a minor point of order from a minor Back Bencher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification, Sir James. There has already been an attack on the Committee of Selection and I thought that that was an attack on you, but you have cleared up the matter in the best faith—as you always do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a gross personal discourtesy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wants to make further comments about misconduct, he should rise and make his points to you, Sir James, because it is unfair that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow should be the victim of comments made from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight, the mention of professional custody suggests that the amendment deals with the legal and criminal system, but our aim is to ensure that a professional element is involved in all aspects of record-keeping. That cuts across points that I have made about security and about the privatisation of record-keeping. The amendment is important and the spirit of it is crucial to record-keeping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not be needed if we were not proceeding with the Bill in such an irresponsible manner. It is clear from debate in Scotland and in this House that the Bill will cause enormous headaches for everyone involved in local government, be they record keepers or those providing services throughout the length and breadth of the country. I constantly have to emphasise that we should not be discussing such absolute nonsense when there are so many real problems to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a bad Bill, the clause heightens the fears of many people who are committed to local government service. They do not need the massive uncertainty that this crazy Bill creates in every clause. I hope that Ministers will take note from my comments that concern exists not only among professional archivists, but among people with a high regard for the security and professional treatment of important records.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed may I point out, as the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside has done, that there is no full stop at the end of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Member for Dumfries up front when we come to clauses 61 and 62 so that we can whistle through them.

The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) mentioned polls, but he did not comment on the poll recently carried out in Helensburgh which, I understand, showed 71 per cent. support for the idea of Helensburgh going into Argyll. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take note of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) made a disparaging remark about my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside being a minor Back Bencher. I did not realise that my hon. Friend had ever worked in the pits, but I find it strange that the hon. Member for Hamilton should cast such aspirations [HON. MEMBERS: "Aspirations?"]—aspersions, sorry—on some of his hon. Friends who come from the pits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know about aspersions cast on a Back Bencher, whoever it was, but hon.

Member for Ayr to keep reminding us of a comment—which I did not hear, unfortunately—made about the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put the record straight. I made a remark from a sedentary position about the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, which would not go on the record. I also said that the Committee would value the fact that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside—who has been remarkably silent on almost every issue for the past few weeks—has found a new role: spotting whether full stops are in the right place. I pay tribute to him for his new usefulness, which should be appreciated by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite sure that the hon. Gentleman will find that my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the speech of the hon. Member for Fife, Central, there may be some confusion about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1328</span>
amendment. He said that an element of professional custody should be required. That suggests that he was looking for a way to introduce private services into an area where none are suggested and where they are certainly not needed. I therefore question the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like my hon. Friend to be aware that his comments were obviously accurate; the hon. Member for Hamilton has disappeared from the Committee Room once again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Committee to be aware of a letter that I received from Dr. Mathews, one of my constituents, who is the honorary secretary of Ayrshire Archaeological and Natural History Society. He welcomes clause 52 and the requirement that it would place on local authorities to look after the records that they have accumulated over many years. He draws attention to some risks that could occur with the changeover. He recalls the last changeover, of 1975, when the old council of Ayr was disbanded and Strathclyde regional council and Kyle and Carrick district council were established. He suggests that, during that transfer, there was wholesale destruction of records. In my view, clause 52 as it stands would address that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has the same letter that I have, he will know that Dr. Mathews goes on to suggest two extensions that could be made to clause 52. He says that there should be consultation with the principal archivist of Strathclyde regional council as well as with the Keeper of the Records, and that a reminder that the current authority's records remain public property should be sent to all staff. More important, he suggests that local authority staff should be reminded that the unauthorised removal or destruction of records remains a criminal offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention or a speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That intervention was too long. It was not relevant to the amendment. Nor were the comments it followed. What the hon. Members for Ayr and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley are discussing may more appropriately be discussed during the clause stand part debate. We are now discussing the insertion of "professional custody" without a full stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James. The points that I had intended to make follow the comments of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. Dr. Mathews does indeed make those points. I felt that they were relevant to the amendment because he gave credence to the local authorities' and the Keeper of the Records' ability to look after the records. That was why I rose to speak at this point in the debate. Following your comments, Sir James, I shall hold back. I shall, however, seek to catch your eye during the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who read the record of what the hon.

I shall now come back to the amendment. The hon. Member for Ayr said that the use of the words "professional custody" in the amendment implied that Opposition Members would be in favour of privatising the holding of local authority records. The hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley pointed out in a telling intervention that Dr. Mathews is calling for the unauthorised removal or destruction of public records to be made a criminal offence. Subsection (2) of the clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may dispose of any records which they do not consider to be worthy of preservation."</p></blockquote>
All kinds of people can end up running local authorities. Are we to leave it to them to decide which records to keep and which to destroy? If the intention is to have proper professional custody of records, subsection (2) should not be part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proper professional advice should be available to local authorities to ensure that they keep those records that are central to the history of local government in Scotland. When that history comes to be written, Conservative members of the Committee will be seen to have played a poor role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address the problem of what constitutes a record. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) referred to the personal files of social work departments, education departments and other departments in local authorities. We are all worried about access to those records and how they will be protected professionally so that they are not open to abuse. However, what other records come under that definition? Obviously, records of meetings will be included, but will the successor authorities retain records of meetings of the former authorities, or will those records be destroyed and so vanish forever from history?

I was referring to the need for professional custody of different records and that is why I believed that I was in order in speaking to the amendment. I wonder whether that professional custody should extend to photographic records. There is a tradition in Scottish local government of keeping photographs, or paintings, of Lord Provosts and of convenors of regional councils. I had my picture taken as convenor of Tayside regional council and it is hung in the council chambers at Tayside house. That is a matter of great distinction and, as the first Labour convenor of Tayside regional council, I am proud of it. When Tayside regional council is abolished, my photograph and the paintings of my predecessors will become the property of the successor authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That successor authority will be Dundee and the paintings of the former Lord Provosts of Dundee hang in the district council chambers there. My chances of getting on to the walls of the new chambers must be small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is wrong. The successor authority is not just Dundee; the successor authorities to Tayside regional council are Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross. Therefore, there is a risk that his picture could be cut in three and distributed among those three councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That highlights the need for professional custody of records. The three successor authorities in Tayside will make competing claims for access to the portraits and pictures that are hung on the walls of Tayside council chambers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is important to retain matters of public property, such as the picture of the hon. Gentleman. I suggest that he and I should get together and try to persuade whoever makes the decision that such pictures should be kept in the Dundee art gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The prospect of my picture hanging in the art gallery in Dundee is a temptation that I shall forsake. We are dealing with a serious problem. It is not simply a question of how the portraits and photographs of former convenors and provosts will be distributed to the successor authorities and whether professional advice will be sought; other issues are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Tayside regional council has had a twinning arrangement with La Charente in France for many years. Many documents, such as charters about the twinning and about the presents exchanged between the authorities, have been accrued. What will happen to those records of the twinning arrangement which will cease when we move to the successor authorities? Which successor authority can lay claim to the charter that twins Tayside regional council with La Charente? Indeed, what will happen to the barrel of brandy that is in the convenor's office? Which successor authority can lay claim to that record of the twinning arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1332</span>
As a water authority, Tayside regional council instituted a programme entitled Water Aid. It was designed to raise money for third-world countries in which it is particularly difficult to obtain water. There are many records about that programme. What will happen to them and how will they be looked after professionally by the successor authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not thought through all the implications of the abolition of regional councils and the transfer to successor authorities. In those circumstances, it is essential that we have professional control of the documents. The clause does not make allowance for such professional custody. Therefore, we must put such a provision into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to the Keeper of the Records. I am not familiar with that title. The only keepers that I know are Paddy Bonner and others who keep goal for premier league teams in Scotland. However, I have also heard of the keeper of the golden quaich, who is a high figure in the Scotch whisky industry and holds balls at which he hands out whisky. I have never been invited even though I am the secretary of the all-party Scotch whisky group. I suppose Labour Members are not invited by the keeper of the golden quaich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked up the Keeper of the Records and discovered that he is Patrick Moubray Cadell, the son of Colonel H. M. Cadell of Grange, OBE. No doubt, he is a true working-class lad who fought his way to the top. He attended Merchiston Castle school in Edinburgh and went to Trinity college, Cambridge. He has a distinguished background in the National Library of Scotland and in the museum service. He is the type of person who would offer the professional expertise sought by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not give the Keeper of the Records a central role. Local authorities are required to consult him and he is given free access to their records. If an authority is determined to defy the Keeper of the Records, there is nothing to prevent it from doing so. That is worrying. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central raised the prospect of some authorities seeking to privatise the handling of such records. Such a move would not necessarily lead to the records being handled with the professional expertise that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy is what they describe as the prior options test. Before anything remains in the public sector, it has to go through a series of tests. The first is whether the public sector should do the task. If the Government's view is that it should, what will Conservative local authorities do? They will ask whether they need to keep the records. I am not convinced that the clause places a statutory obligation on authorities to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative authorities will then ask whether they can privatise the service, either by giving it directly to the private sector and letting someone else take over completely or by putting it out to contract. Again, some Conservative local authorities will choose to put it straight into the private sector, even if the people involved are not too professional. That will not matter to those authorities because it would be cheaper than keeping the archivist service in-house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Commmittee is discussing such records which need to be handled sensitively and with the utmost professionalism. They are so handled by the records departments and archivist service that exist within the local authority structure.

Kyle and Carrick is happy to bring in Spanish contractors.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall stick to discussing the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all received a briefing from the Society of Archivists which summarised the main points that it was worried about. They are encompassed by the amendment. First, the society argued that existing records offices should be retained where possible. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>1334</span>
cannot be a professional capacity for looking after records in Scotland unless the existing network of records offices is retained. Nothing in the clause would allow that to happen, so the amendment must be accepted. Secondly, the society insists that any agreements between authorities should be long term, binding and not purely voluntary. The amendment provides for "professional custody", which would permit the professionals to insist that local authorities enter agreements which will ensure that their records are properly looked after. Care would not be left to the whims of whichever party happened to be in charge of a council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the society argues that responsibilities for archives vested in the new authorities should be defined by statute. Labour Members are trying to define by statute that there should be proper professional custody of records held by local authorities. There is no statutory definition in the clause that makes local authorities responsible, as the Society of Archivists would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the society wants an enhanced role for the Keeper of the Records of Scotland, particularly in deciding on the ownership and custody of records. That is vital. The Keeper of the Records can be trusted with the professional handling of the records held by local government at present, but he is not given a central enough role by the clause. That is why it is necessary to add our amendment about professional custody. If the Committee is fair minded and seriously concerned about the proper handling of records by the successor authorities in local government, it should agree to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I want to raise a point about something that you said earlier about a clause stand part debate. I am sitting quietly now because I want to keep within the terms of the amendment. I hope that those of us who want to raise wider points will not be excluded just because we are having a debate on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has raised a valid point. Although I suggested earlier that there might not be one, there will be a clause stand part debate. Many of the matters that have been mentioned so far could have been properly raised in that debate. I have not curtailed the debate: I assume that hon. Members who have spoken to the amendment will not wish to participate in the clause stand part debate. We will not lose any time and, certainly, there will be no repetition of argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is fairly narrow. It lays down clearly that the individuals and body concerned must be of a professional standing. That makes for an interesting situation. Who are the people with professional standing in terms of looking after records? Librarians and individuals with experience in the data world can be considered professional. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr was right when he suggested that this provision opens up opportunities for putting the service out to the private sector. I include in that the possibility that the universities or colleges in Dundee or elsewhere might well be considered bodies with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1335</span>
professional expertise. If the opportunity arises, they may wish to bid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East spoke about information kept on floppy discs. Any information that is kept on any kind of computer equipment must be covered by the Data Protection Acts and other related legislation. That should be considered when contemplating the future use of these records. One of those Acts deals with the handling of information and its disposal. The hon. Gentleman also spoke about portraits, paintings, photographs and pictures of former distinguished convenors. He mentioned Tayside region. He must realise that I and others also have an interest. Alastair Duncan Miller is a distinguished constituent of mine and he would have some interest in what happens. The late Willie Hughes was a good friend of mine and his family would have an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being completely frivolous, simply because the hon. Member for Dundee, East raised the matter. It is right to keep proper records of distinguished service given to the Tayside community, including that of the hon. Member for Dundee, East. To become the convenor of a region is no mean achievement. The records should be properly looked after. That practice is part of our tradition and history—something that the hon. Member for Dundee, East does not always support. In his period as a convenor he created some tradition and history. He might not have realised this but when one treads those boards, as they say, one leaves one's imprints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has a marked widening effect, rather than a narrowing one. I am not unhappy about or critical of that. Records are important and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure us during the clause stand part debate that they will be properly looked after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While trying to stick to the amendment, I must mention that any talk of floppy discs neglects to take account of the enormous range of skills, data retrieval methods and storage materials involved after 20 years—never mind the original archive material inherited by the new authority. The matter that we are considering might seem small, but in the longer, historical, term, it is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill creates a statutory duty for the new authority to consult the Keeper of the Records before taking action with regard to records—but what happens during and after reorganisation? That issue is the point of the amendment. What happens to materials after they become the property of the new authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill lays down a duty to provide free access to the records, after their transfer, for local authorities and for the Keeper of the Records. If the records are not professionally and properly preserved, catalogued and available, that will not be much of a duty. We must ensure that the records are kept and made available to the Keeper of the Records and other local authorities. Hence the need for "professional custody", care and concern for the records. Clause 52(2) enables a local authority to
	<br><blockquote><p>"dispose of any records which they do not consider to be worthy of preservation."</p></blockquote>
The decision is a subjective one for the local authority. If such choices are to be made properly, professional intervention is required. The Bill allows the Keeper of the Records to comment on the arrangements for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1336</span>
keeping the records. There is a strong case for going further and ensuring that there is professional custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is about the meaning of the term "proper arrangements". The documents concerned are historical, archive and other assorted records that reflect all aspects of the life and times of local communities throughout Scotland. Local government daily provides services for the whole population. It comes into contact with everybody in Scotland and holds unique records of everyday life during its existence. Local government has a unique contact with, record of and insight into the everyday reality of Scotland. In the long term, the amendment is all about that. We owe it to future generations to ensure that 20 years in the history of the regions and districts is neither lost nor endangered, but preserved and made freely available as and when needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that local authorities' existing arrangements for keeping archives and presenting the information from them is now insufficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I want to know from the Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East pointed out that when the records are transferred, a range of modern archiving skills will be called upon, such as those relating to photographs and computer materials. If they exist in Tayside region, will they automatically be replicated in the three councils there? What extra costs will be involved, and have they been allowed for in the changeover?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that such records would be dealt with professionally, which would entail the use of all those individual skills. "Professional custody" would mean proper archiving, storage, cataloguing and security. It was bad enough last time, when provost chains and other materials were lost; we should not allow archive and other historical material to be lost through neglect this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember the lessons of the previous reorganisation. This will be a period of turmoil and change, and things can go missing. I would rather that that did not happen. We know what happened 20 years ago, so we should take precautions to ensure that such losses do not occur again. There is altogether too much short termism in the Bill. What assurances can the Government give that irreplaceable records will not be lost or mislaid during the turmoil or reorganisation? The new councils will, by definition, be totally absorbed by immediate and future concerns as they settle in. It is therefore important that some thought be given now to the longer term. The amendment's reference to professionalism would ensure that the quality of record keeping was guaranteed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will support the amendment or, at least, guarantee how, in a period of turmoil, these important records will be safeguarded and maintained for the use of future generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support what the hon. Member for Angus, East has said about the turmoil of the previous reorganisation. With the best will in the world, all sorts of things are lost—it is in the very nature of these changes. Even with the total good will of those responsible, it is impossible to keep track of everything.

What assessment has been made of the amount of material that was lost last time? Anecdotally, there was quite a loss. I should declare an interest here. I am a relatively active member of the Scottish Record Society, and my wife is an extremely active member. What discussions have the Government had with Dr. Irene O'Brien of the Mitchell Library in Glasgow regarding the very real fears of the professionals in this field about what will happen? Have they been able to deal with the fears that were expressed last October when I contacted the Scottish Office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also take into account the sheer fragility of many of these records. Any move to other locations is bound to damage them. I am told by Mrs. Rowey Mitchison, who researched the Poor Law in Scotland for some years, that the records on that subject are extremely fragile. What assessment has been made regarding moving records, and what is the Government's intention in that respect? That is my first question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>My second question is whether the Minister intends to require the new local authorities to prepare a cultural services policy and a plan for their area, which would include the management and development of museums, galleries, libraries, and arts and record facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seriatim: the third question is whether it is the Minister's belief that museum and gallery collections and record collections held by local authorities are inalienable community assets held in trust and that they will not be deliberately disposed of for financial gain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question is this: is it the Minister's intention to continue the rights of local authorities to provide financial assistance to cultural organisations carrying out activities at regional or national level outwith their area? That has considerable consequences—for example, for the Scottish mining museum, which has been the subject of massive correspondence between the Scottish Office and the relevant authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, is it the Minister's intention to advise local authorities to use the Museums and Galleries Commission's national museum registration scheme as the acceptable minimum standard which should be maintained by all local authority museum and gallery services and all independent museums and galleries and archives supported by local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have total confidence in Patrick Cadell as a serious scholar as the Keeper of the Records. My last question is this: have the Government had discussions with him and what is Mr Cadell's attitude to the proposed changes?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to recognise that we are talking of a massive holding of material, some of which dates back a very long time, as my hon. Friend said, which is part of Scotland's national and local historical archives. We are also talking of active records, involving our constituents. Hardly a year goes by without people encountering difficulties because records of decisions or action taken by previous local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>1338</span>
have been mislaid. I recall at least two cases in my constituency last year relating to people's property and to boundaries of council property, when agreements made between the previous borough councils and individual citizens or property owners were giving rise to difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise the scale of the problem. Local authorities hold massive volumes of paper and more high-tech material containing the records. If the Bill is enacted, the new local authorities will have much work on their hands in setting up the new structures, committees, procedures, and so on. There is a great danger that important material will simply be forgotten as they move from one building or even one town to another. Therefore, it is inevitable that some officials will regard accumulations of old papers and old documents as a distraction and such material could be lost or certainly could be misplaced. It is essential to include in the Bill safeguards to ensure that this important aspect of Scotland's local and national archives is protected not only for the benefit of historians in their researches in the future but for citizens and the families of current citizens who may be affected by decisions that are currently held on local authority records, which may get shuffled around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are on the subject of missing archives, I should say that the continual references by the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood, to my absences were pretty childish. Therefore, I shall not mention the fact that the Under-Secretary has left the Room!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton would not lower himself to the level of the Minister, who has conducted himself in the most infantile manner. Never in my 15 years in the House have I known a Minister conduct himself in such a way in Committee or anywhere else. Such infantile chattering by the Minister not only demeans his office, but the Committee. Such rubbish brings parliamentary proceedings into disrepute in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for my hon. Friend for making that point, but I hope that he will not do so again. He must not lower himself to the Minister's level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would impose a duty on local authorities to use the services of professional archivists for their records management. We would encourage local authorities to provide for their records to be managed by professional archivists wherever possible. In fulfilling his new role under this clause of commenting on the arrangements that local authorities propose, the Keeper of the Records of Scotland, who is the Secretary of State's professional adviser on archive matters, will seek to promote best possible professional standards and practice. We do not, however, wish to require local authorities to fulfil their duties in any particular way. It is for them to decide how their records management service should be organised and staffed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he wanted to encourage local authorities to use professional archivists

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By no means all existing local authorities use professional archivists. As with other decisions, it should be left to local authorities to decide how to fulfil the statutory duty imposed by clause. We have consulted the keeper.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the points made by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). He asked about the current position. At present, the position is exactly the same as that proposed by the Bill. Existing statutory duty is contained in section 200 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 which provides for local authorities to make proper arrangements for the records in their custody. The proposals will provide continuity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key point is what happens if local authorities defy the keeper. Under clause 52(1), local authorities will have a statutory duty to make proper arrangements for their records as they have done in the past. If a local authority does not make proper arrangements, the Secretary of State has powers under default legislation, which is contained in section 211 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The keeper will not know what records are available. Local authorities will be the only ones to know that. The keeper may comment all he likes, but he will not know whether the records are being looked after properly. What are the cost and resource implications of the clause? What estimate does the Minister have for transition costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 52(1) states that a local authority shall make proper arrangements and
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall, before putting any such arrangements into effect, or making any material change to such arrangements, consult the Keeper of the Records of Scotland".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Keeper will know the arrangements. I am glad that suitable tributes have been paid to the expertise and professionalism of Patrick Cadell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked what constitutes a record. The answer is in clause 52 (6). It covers documents
	<br><blockquote><p>"of whatever form and in whatever medium".</p></blockquote>
That could include photographic records.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1340</span>
On the destruction of records, the point made by Dr. Mathews, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr referred, will be taken into account by the keeper in the discussions with authorities in the run-up to reorganisation. He will stress the need for consultation with local archivists. Local authorities already have the power to destroy records that they do not need, but their general principles for doing so have to be discussed with the Keeper of the Records. It goes without saying that if people break in and steal or destroy archives they can be charged with offences under the existing laws of theft, malicious mischief, arson or robbery, depending on the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify what he said about Mr. Patrick Cadell and clauses 52 and 53? Are we to understand that Mr. Cadell agrees with everything that the Government are doing in this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Patrick Cadell supports clauses 52 and 53 and is ready to ensure that they will be implemented as professionally as possible. As I mentioned earlier, the Secretary of State has enforcement powers if there is any difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the points about destruction. The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked about contracting out. The clause specifies that each new authority must make appropriate arrangements for the preservation and management of records. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) wondered whether a university library, for example, would be a suitable place. That could involve contracting out, provided that the statutory safeguards in clause 52 were followed, which includes consultation with the keeper. My hon. Friend's point about university archives, which are extremely well kept, is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago, the Minister referred by name to the Keeper of the Records who, I understand, is a civil servant. Therefore, let me warn the Minister, unless he is a bit more careful, his fellow Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, will try to remove him from the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other hon. Members referred to him before I did. We are discussing the Keeper of the Records of Scotland. I was asked specifically whether I had consulted not just any keeper, but the particular person who holds that post. I gave a straight answer to a straight question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus, East raised the question of costs. Once again, Opposition Members have tabled a woolly amendment that does not contain detail about the costs or about what they actually want. Can my hon. Friend supply a figure, given the woolliness of this silly amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A problem is not likely to arise because clause 52(4) makes clear that when authorities have joint arrangements, the proportion of the costs will be agreed by the authorities. If the authorities do not agree, the proportion may be determined by the Secretary of State. The Keeper of the Records is a civil servant, but he is also a statutory office

	<span class='label label-info column'>1341</span>
holder. That post has existed from earliest times. In the circumstances, I hope that the Opposition will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am not quite clear about the discussions with Patrick Cadell. Are we clear beyond peradventure that Mr. Cadell supports all the Government's proposals? That is slightly different from giving general support for clauses 52 and 53.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, have there been discussions with Scottish archivists, particularly Dr. Irene O'Brien of the Mitchell Library? What was the result of those discussions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may care to reflect on my four other questions which were not addressed. I should like to repeat one of them. Is it the Minister's intention to continue the rights of local authorities to provide assistance to cultural organisations carrying out activities at regional and national level outwith their area? It is important because unless that is agreed archives would have to be split up and moved. Once again, I beg the Minister and his advisors to understand just how fragile many of the archives have become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking on the funding of inter-regional cultural bodies. We are well aware of the issues concerned. We shall bring forward an amendment in due course making it clear that local authorities are entitled to provide funding for cultural organisations that operate outwith an individual local government area. The hon. Member asked about Dr O'Brien. She wrote to me and her comments were considered when the clauses were being drawn up. The Keeper of the Records is in touch with all professional archivists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that irreplaceable materials will be lost. The Minister assures us, however, that the Keeper of the Records is happy with the clause and that there will be consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman think that there could be losses of material when there is a statutory duty on all local authorities now to make proper arrangements and when there will be in future when the Bill is enacted? How could such loss occur without a breach of the law when the Secretary of State has enforcement powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is quite simple. I was there in 1974 and I saw it happen. The Minister does not understand or has not taken on board the chaos and confusion that will be caused and the fragility of many of the records. By definition the local authorities will be so introverted, looking at the short term and the creation of their own organisations, that not much thought will be given to the long term. That was the point of tabling the amendment. During the short-term changeover I would hope that the Government would be much more positive in ensuring that the longer-term interests of those records are maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talks about consultation with the keeper. In the destruction of records, how would local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>1342</span>
consult? What details would the keeper have about records that were intended to be destroyed? Would general categories be sent to him or would he know about specific records? He cannot know in detail what local authorities have. Much will depend on what local authorities do and what resources they have. They will be very introverted and will look at more general problems. I would like to have seen a much more positive response from the Government to meet our concerns. I was there in 1974 and I saw what happended. That is why I am worried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like clarification about what will happen to regional councils' records. This is the only part of the Bill where a joint board has not been set up. Either the records of existing regional authorities will be dispersed among the new authorities that will be set up in areas such as Strathclyde, Lothian or Tayside, which are being broken up or they will have to come under the umbrella of the central authorities, under the auspices of the Scottish Office. The records are important and cover a substantial period of time. They may be of limited interest and it may be complicated to try to split them up among the new authorities. Could the Minister explain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a dilemma. I have lots of points to make. I was keeping them to the clause stand part debate but everyone seems to be asking questions well beyond the scope of the narrow amendment. I will make my points now or later. It is up to you, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would give me a moment to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have come as a bit of a lifesaver, Mr. Martin. I am always willing to help the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the amendment is to be tabled but I cannot hide my dismay about what is happening. Although local authorities may have the power to finance worthy causes outside their areas, it is in the nature of authorities to put such causes second to that which they have to do and that for which they are seen to be directly responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are starved of money and I fear that many worthy causes will not receive the finance that they received from the larger regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate on an issue that some people think is less significant than other major items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Ministers' responses and my hon. Friend's point about what will happen to regional authority records, many issues are unresolved. I hope that the message that we have sent out has been absorbed by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the point discussed by the hon. Member for East Lothian is dealt with by clause 52(1)(a) and clause 15, which deals with the transfer of property? Clause 15 also provides that statutory instruments have to be laid before the House when property is transferred to a new authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is ranging wider, but it is important at this stage that a probing amendment has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1343</span>
been moved and there has been a discussion. My hon. Friends may be able to contribute further on clause stand part, subject to you, Mr. Martin, calling hon. Members to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to continue commenting on the letter from Dr. Mathews and the Ayrshire Archaeological Natural History Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Mathews expressed anxieties and many of them were addressed in the debate. He highlighted that at the last change, there was a wholesale destruction of records, particularly of planning records, in many parts of Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that each of the directors appointed to posts in the new structures and those who will leave posts in the former structures recognise and assume the responsibilities of their specific roles. I should like to think that that will be the case and that the Government will ensure that sufficient guidelines are issued at the time of change to ensure that there is full compliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Mathews was worried about the illegal removal of public records by staff. That will not always have occurred because of deliberate action. In many cases, removal will be a consequence of a range of happenings and staffs failure to understand the importance of aspects of the documents in their charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure from the start that safeguards are put in place and that each local authority makes every member of staff fully aware of the importance of ensuring that documentation and other items in their charge should be returned to central records for long-term retention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Mathews also raised an important point about the storage of inherited records. Although it is 20 years since the previous local authority structure change, each local authority still has a responsibility to maintain records dating well beyond its period of responsibility. I look for assurances that keen attention will be paid to the task of ensuring that those records are stored legitimately and safely for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Storage methods are important. As hon. Members suggested earlier in the debate, all kinds of new ways of storing information are available these days. The computer age is upon us and computerised records will be essential for the future, just as photostatic records or photographically produced records have proved useful for long-term protection of previously recorded details and information. Many records are still stored on paper. Often basements are used and damp affects storage. We would like to think that the conditions that the Bill, and clause 52 in particular, imposes, will ensure that local authorities have full responsibility for ensuring means of storage that are adequate to the task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There must be a blue moon out there, because for once I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Ayr has said—or, rather, I have done so twice today. I sympathise with him because, like me
	<span class='label label-info column'>1344</span>
earlier, he was caught by your predecessor, Mr. Martin, for going beyond the terms of the previous amendment. Later, other members of the Committee ranged over issues that the hon. Gentleman in his speech, and I, in my intervention, had wanted to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention the Minister challenged the hon. Member for Angus, East. The challenge was unusually aggressive for the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). He asked whether there was proof that any records might be destroyed and why the hon. Gentleman harboured fears about that. He said that he was around in 1975. I was, too. The hon. Member for Ayr has quoted Dr. Mathews who said that last time around wholesale destruction and illegal removal of records took place. My question to the Minister is what is different this time? What is he doing to ensure that during the coming reorganisation there will be no wholesale destruction or illegal removal? How will the clause deal with that? It is a move in the right direction, but I am not sure that it provides a guarantee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can supplement my hon. Friend's point from my own experience. I tried, after the previous reorganisation, to seek out details of police records for the Island of Islay where my grandfather was the sergeant at the end of the second world war. Valuable records were kept there of his services to the nation—for which he was awarded the MBE—relating to two American troop ships that sank. I was informed, after a careful search, that practically all the records of the former Argyllshire constabulary had been destroyed on the reorganisation of local government in 1975. That deprived me of information that I valued, but it also deprived future generations of extremely important and valuable information. My hon. Friend is right to seek assurances that that will not happen again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend gives an excellent example. No doubt hundreds of such examples can be provided around Scotland. Incidentally, my hon. Friend's grandfather had a distinguished record in the police, and so, I understand, did his father and brother. I believe that his son is also interested. I understand that my hon. Friend is considered the black sheep of the family for his wayward move into politics. It is not surprising that he is anxious to establish his good credentials, from an ancestral point of view, by ensuring that the records are properly kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr also spoke about the storage of records and the destruction caused by cold and damp conditions. Improper storage is one way to destroy records, but there are other ways, especially if records are stored on magnetic tape. It is very important that records are stored properly, irrespective of whether they are on paper or held on magnetic tape or disks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the narrowness of the earlier debate in which I spoke I did not get the opportunity to refer to the letter that the Society of Archivists wrote to members of the Committee. It says that the responsibilities of the successor authorities, imposed by section 200 of the 1973 Act, were quite vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1345</span>
The society says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new authorities were not required to establish record offices, nor to provide for access to the records or for their secure custody in proper environmental conditions."</p></blockquote>
The society saw that as a mistake in 1973, and the Government are repeating the mistake in 1994.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend is able to take part in the stand part debate. He has made a valuable point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak about the costs of preserving and maintaining these records. I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that those costs will be provided for in local government revenue support grant settlements. Those are necessary costs. It is the unnecessary costs that worry me. Why must we go through all the records that different authorities have collected over the years—including the photograph of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East—divide them up and allocate them to various authorities? Why must we go through such a long, tedious and expensive exercise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to Strathclyde's records when the region is broken up into 12 authorities? Strathclyde holds planning, educational and social work records. Their division and allocation to different authorities will be a substantial exercise. I believe that a number of Strathclyde's records are held centrally in Glasgow. They will have to be divided into 12, and kept in storage in 12 dry, properly protected areas. That will involve extra cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have expressed concern about the cost or reorganisation in relation to other services. We should not underestimate the cost of splitting up the records between the local authorities. Whether the Keeper of the Records is consulted or not, I think that we deserve to be told by the Minister how the exercise will be carried out. The problem applies equally to Grampian, Lothian and Tayside, but the magnitude is greater in Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has made a bull point. Because it is a question of cost, Strathclyde region will be holding feudal charters and feudal superiorities which will straddle boundaries. It will be impossible to divide individual records. Who will determine which authority gets the feu charter if the boundaries of the new unitary authority are straddled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. The hon. Gentleman is a qualified lawyer as well as a qualified pharmacist—a combination which suggests many interesting possibilities.
Clause 52(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority holds records relating to the property or functions of any other local authority, that other local authority shall … be entitled to free access to, and copies of, any such records".</p></blockquote>
That does not deal with this point, but it shows that some records will straddle authorities. There will be difficulties involved in allowing other local authorities access to, or a copy of, records. Even before that happens, there will be tussles as to which authority will have control of the records in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1346</span>
We come now to titles of property. Perhaps other hon. Members have had the same problem but during the past 15 years, which spans three quarters of the period since the last reorganisation, I have had a number of complaints about the inability of local authorities to establish the title to a property. It is quite astonishing and it creates tremendous problems for house sales and the transfer or disposal of properties. A substantial amount of property disposal will follow reorganisation and there will be acquisition of other property, particularly in Strathclyde. New headquarters will be established. They will be acquired and surplus property will be disposed of. There will be major problems finding the paper to support claims to the title of a property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may dispose of any records which they do not consider to be worthy of preservation."</p></blockquote>
That is a huge loophole. It is an opportunity for local authorities to dispose of large amounts of important records. If they decide that they do not have enough money or space to store them they can throw them away or burn them. The Minister owes it to the Committee to explain what he understands to be the circumstances under which a local authority might reasonably dispose of any record. I hope that they will be limited. I hope that this will not be seen as justification for what the hon. Member for Ayr rightly described as the wholesale disposal of records that took place last time. The kind of records that local authorities might dispose of needs to be spelt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. It struck me that if, God save us, we ever got a Conservative administration in the new Dundee council, it might seek to obliterate the record of the recent by-election in Hilltown where the Conservatives came in behind the Communist party of Great Britain, Marxist branch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. They may try to dispose of the records but they can never dispose of the results of those election losses. I cannot remember the last time that a Conservative won a by-election anywhere in Scotland; certainly not in Ralston, which was a monumental failure. The record of the Ralston by-election will be kept by my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman. There was a by-election in North Tayside which we won.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Now that we evened up the score perhaps we can return to the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How are Hearts doing in the league?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. We stole a point at Kirkcaldy on Saturday. That is now on the record so I am in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members have heard ad finitum, I was a councillor on Edinburgh corporation from 1970–75 and on Lothian regional council from 1974–79. Perhaps there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1347</span>
are records of what I said and did then that I might like them to dispose of. From the point of view of history, however, those records need to be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was when he was with Alan Wood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was long before Alan Wood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing occurred to me and this again relates to the letter from Dr. Mathews that was sent to all Ayrshire Members and the Secretary of State. Incidentally, has the Minister replied to Dr. Mathews? I have not received a copy of any reply. He made the point that local authority records are consulted not only by historians, but by lawyers, architects, surveyors, planners, school pupils and individuals in the business community. I want to discuss architects and surveyors. The planning records will be interesting. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton will be interested in the records of the planning application for Robertson's Field in Ayr. We should not want those records destroyed. We should want to see exactly how the Provost first argued against development at Robertson's Field, then a little later supported such development. Unfortunately, the records will not show what influenced him to make that amazing U-turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial planning and building control records will need to be made available to architects and surveyors. I am worried about what will happen in the shadow year, the changeover year. There will be total chaos and confusion. Will the records go to Strathclyde region or will it, or a district authority, have to pack up those records and be ready to send them to all 12 new authorities? Some records will be in tea chests; others will be travelling in vans from one authority to another. Planners, surveyors and architects will have a huge problem in consulting records in that transition year. What provision will be made for access to records during the transition year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there will be about 30 authorities, the likelihood of their being able and willing—for financial and other reasons—to appoint professional archivists will diminish. Will the Minister give an assurance that professional archivists will be employed by the new authorities to look after important records professionally and properly? The authorities have a responsibility to liaise with the Keeper of the Records, Mr. Patrick Moubray—it was bad enough to mention Patrick, but mention of Moubray worried me even more—Cadell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pronounced "Cadill".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now in difficulty. Pronunciation was never my strong point. I give way to my hon. Friend, who is an expert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was one of the most distinguished geologists in the early part of the century and wrote an excellent history of West Lothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now I am slightly confused: I am not sure whether we are talking about the Keeper of the Records or of an early geologist. Many of my hon. Friends know that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer could not be trusted because he did not know
	<span class='label label-info column'>1348</span>
how to pronounce his name. I have encountered some difficulty with the pronunciation of my name, which can cause embarrassment from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Keeper of the Records is to have a professional link with the new authorities, he would expect them to appoint archivists. I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are important. The charters, deeds, minutes and accounts of local authorities must be preserved properly. It will cost much money and the disruption to the records of Scottish local authorities will cause chaos and confusion. In sitting after sitting of the Committee there emerge, incrementally, more and more reasons why this lunatic reorganisation should not go ahead. This is yet another of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The records will show that the surname of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has been modified with the passing of time. Records demonstrate that that is probably true of a number of people. Records change with the passage of time because those who interpret them and translate them into current language often change things. That is often done through genuine error, but sometimes it is deliberate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and other hon. Members have suggested that the clause will lead to chaos and confusion because of the changes that have been made to other parts of the Bill. They claim that they will create doubt during the transition period and lead to questions on the apportionment of records in the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are interesting thoughts, but my mind wanders to what would happen if a Scottish Assembly were set up. Would not similar problems of records, responsibilities and transfers arise? Apparently, they would not because it appears that no powers or authority would be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we go down that path, I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are debating the records held by local authorities and not a proposed Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Martin. I am merely drawing attention to the confusion that arises because of what Opposition Members have said. Changes in the structures and powers of local authorities will take place. My remark was an aside that pointed out that powers would have to be taken from local authorities and given to any Assembly or Parliament which was set up. Therefore, the clause is relevant to such a proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has been made that there should be no change in the way in which local authorities are structured and that they should not have powers apportioned to them. It has been argued that it would be difficult to retain the records and that it would be difficult to examine properly the records when they are passed from the former authorities to the new ones. I do not argue with the need for the records to be examined properly. For example, anyone who has campaigned to keep a cottage hospital open after it has been under threat for more than 30
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1349</span>
years, will understand that it is important to examine old records to see who said what and at what time. When one examines records, one attempts to build up patterns and confirm historical facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm whether some records have to be kept for statutory reasons? Some of them are mentioned in subsection (6) which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages".</p></blockquote>
Surely, other records must be kept for statutory reasons. Titles to property and land must be kept for many reasons, especially if one wishes to dispose of property. The absence of records on properties that were gifted makes it difficult to dispose of them. The original title is obscure and there may be doubt as to who is the superior landlord. Therefore, there are records that should be kept for statutory reasons, but others which it is wise to keep if property is to be disposed of at a later date. In addition, records on structural plans and on planning that is contrary to those plans should be kept. They create local precedents that may have an impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important aspect must be considered. The recent flooding in Tayside clearly demonstrates the importance of keeping records, for instance, of areas that are prone to flooding. When drawing up structure plans, it is unwise to plan for housing developments on the flood plains because there is a fair chance that they will be flooded. We need to consider such records and their transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased that, in its wisdom, Tayside region had operated on the basis of the local authority areas of Perth and Kinross, Angus and Dundee, according to divisional operations. That will make the transfer of records to the divisions easier—those divisions will become the new authorities under the Bill's provisions. Problems may arise with centrally held records, certainly with portraits and paintings. The functional departments—the social work, education and other departments—were broken down by the region into the divisions, which happen to coincide pretty well with the boundaries of the new authorities. That will give rise to opportunities for efficient and effective rationalisation. I am not so sure whether that will be true of other parts of Scotland. I should have thought that the matters about which the hon. Member for Dundee, East expressed concern, however, will not be as difficult to resolve in Tayside as elsewhere in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of what the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, the redistribution of regional councils' records is an important issue. The Minister tried to dismiss the matter by saying that the transfer of such property—archives, and so on—will be dealt with by orders under the provisions in clause 15. That will not suffice. The Minister owes it to the Committee to explain the Government's intentions more fully; it is no good the Government leaving it until much later, until the new authorities are up and running, to decide to introduce an order explaining whether all the regional records should be kept together and put into the custody of one of the successor authorities. Will they launch a massive operation to split up those records and allocate them among the successor authorities? If that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1350</span>
happens, how will it be paid for? If one successor authority will have the duty of looking after a region's archives, that will cost more. Will any more money be provided for that? Will the Minister tell us the Government's thoughts on the matter, not only for the sake of the Committee but for many people outside?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention has been drawn to the correspondence between the director of the Scottish Arts Council and an unmentionable civil servant. The director of the SAC wrote to a civil servant, who cannot be mentioned in view of what was said earlier, at the Scottish Office Education Department. The civil servant's reply was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Government's intention to introduce a provision on cultural services by amendment during the Committee stage of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
Surely "cultural services" would include historical archives. The reply continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is, at present, uncertain when this will take place but we will keep you informed and provide you with a copy of the amendment when it has been tabled. It is intended that interested parties should have adequate notice of the terms of the amendment before it is considered in Committee."</p></blockquote>
Where the hell is that amendment? We should like to know so that we may properly consider it. I suspect that people outside would also like to know about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the lady concerned—the unmentionable—is writing on behalf of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course she is. She has written on behalf of the Secretary of State that the amendment will be tabled and considered in Committee. It obviously applies to the category of archive material that we are discussing. Everyone will, apparently, be consulted about it. Where is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North is right that the matter of flooding is important. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that there were some archives that he might wish to be destroyed. I shall give him an example that may be within his memory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman was chairman of the education committee, I received a letter from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) on behalf of the last Labour Government, promising funding for a community centre for Drumbrae. The hon. Gentleman went off with the funds and used them for another purpose, whereupon I had an Adjournment debate on the subject in the House. To the credit of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, however, the next year—there had been bad publicity—he provided a community centre, although it was rather smaller than we wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am proud of those records because the money was used for the provision of the Wester Hailes education centre. It was added to the school money and we provided one of the first and most successful community schools in Scotland. I am grateful to the Minister for mentioning these records.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1351</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to discover where the funds went because it was not made clear at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between now and the previous local government reorganisation is that there must be consultation with the Keeper of the Records. Not only that, the Scottish Office Home and Health Department is preparing to issue two circulars with the Keeper of the Records, one on transitional arrangements, the other on best practice. I hope that that deals with the points made by the hon. Member for East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that wholesale destruction is inappropriate, whether it relates to the MBE of the grandfather of the hon. Member for Hamilton or other, more current matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has dismissed the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given way. How can he justify the wholesale disposal of the Argyll police records at the previous reorganisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a great one for sitting in his seat and failing to listen to a single word that has been uttered. If he had a little more common sense, he would have realised that I said the fundamental difference between the Bill and its predecessor is that there will be consultation with the keeper. Not only that, circulars will be sent out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just said to the hon. Member for Hamilton, who is about to rise, that I of course agree with him that the citation for his grandfather's MBE should have been kept. Guidance will be issued to local authorities in the circulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about cost. It is a local authority's statutory duty to make proper arrangements for records. That will
	<span class='label label-info column'>1352</span>
be taken into account in the distribution of the revenue support grant, as now. The duties are similar to those in the past, with the addition of consultation with the keeper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North asked about documents that have to be maintained for other purposes. That is true of financial, VAT, adoption and social work records, but they are not dealt with by the clause. There will be other statutory provision relating to such records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will not do. The Minister said that he had answered my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian. He has not. The letter of 31 January 1994 from a senior civil servant of the education department states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Government's intention to introduce a provision on cultural services by amendment during the Committee stage of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
Can we have an explanation this afternoon of what was meant by the letter? The reference is MGT00331.014.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, I agree totally with my hon. Friend. Does he agree that the Minister has not answered any of a series of serious questions that I posed? For once I asked serious questions and none were replied to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to have taken something in his porridge and is shouting at us like the Prime Minister shouted at the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley). That will not wash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will return at 4.30 pm and give my hon. Friends the Members for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, for East Lothian and for Fife, Central and the hon. Member for Angus, East proper answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
