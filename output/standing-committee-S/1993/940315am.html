	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Why are there no points of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point of order was from a sedentary position, so I can ignore it. It was, however, the best point of order that I have had heard so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted about the prompt start that we are making to our proceedings this morning. I shall not delay the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is consequential to clause 33, which we have already discussed. The schedule contains minor and consequential amendments to the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972. In particular, they provide an enabling power for an authority to carry out a survey of the whole or part of its district, if it thinks fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in clause 33 and in the schedule deliver our commitment to maintain the key components of the current planning system, so ensuring stability in the transition to me new structure. A number of detailed comments on the planning system were made when we discussed clasue 33. A certain amount of unease has been expressed about the continued effectiveness of the planning system in general. Indeed, some commentators have suggested that we ought to have taken the opportunity of local government reform to change the basis of the present planning system rather than seek to retain it in its present form. While we are aware of some criticisms that have been levelled against the working of the planning system—as set out in schedule 4—mainly in terms of cumbersome procedures and delays in decision making, we concluded that, in the interests of causing least disruption to business and industry, it would be prudent to concentrate on ensuring that the new structure is bedded down first, as set out in clause 33 and in the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member later. I would like to take this opportunity, for the convenience of hon. Members, to say that we intend to undertake a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1106</span>
review of the present planning system to ensure that its main customers—developers and the community at large—are being offered a quality service in an effective and efficient manner. That is in line with the commitment to the deregulation initiative and to the citizens charter principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen that the new authorities should have the best possible framework for delivering the planning functions in a truly professional manner. I should stress, however, that whatever changes may eventually be decided, it is our intention to maintain the stability and continuity of the current system, particularly with regard to structure planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the next few months, we shall publish a consultation paper, inviting people's views on the working of the planning system, as set out in clause 33 and the schedule. We shall invite ideas on how the system might be improved. The consultation paper does not conflict with schedule 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy to answer any questions. I commend the schedule to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak at this point, but an important issue has been placed before the Committee. The Minister read out a press release, which my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) almost derailed midway. As the Minister has completed that task and has used the Committee as a vehicle for his press release, perhaps I may comment on its importance and ask some pertinent questions. The Minister bases the gist of his comments—according to the press release which he has just read out—on commentators who
	<br><blockquote><p>"have suggested that we ought to have taken the opportunity of local government reform to change the basis of the present planning system".</p></blockquote>
That is a blanket remark. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on who the commentators are and what authority they have for suggesting at this stage that there should be a change to the planning system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also explain why he is about to undertake another consultation exercise on the planning system when, in January 1994, the Scottish Office published "National Planning Policy Guideline. The Planning System", which appeared to raise precisely the same issue and is out for consultation in local authorities and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claims that the consultations will not be designed to upset the existing basis of structure plans, but that is contradictory because the Government are about to abolish the organisations that have commanded structure planning—the regional councils. Opposition Members are unprepared for dealing with the issue because the Government's press release came into our hands only moments before the sitting began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 12 of the January consultation document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State aims to reach final decisions on structure plans within a year from the date of submission."</p></blockquote>
Now, a new consultation procedure has been launched about a consultation procedure that is already under way and about which the Government appear to have come to conclusions in advance. The Government are to engage in the most peculiar form of consultation. It is not consultation, but a bogus cover for the fact that the Government have already made decisions about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1107</span>
planning procedure, which are designed to weaken the consultation processes that might be involved. That goes side by side with the way in which the Government have attacked the basis of structure planning through the abolition of the regions. They have been unwilling to put in place proper structure plan areas that would have allowed structure plans to have some meaning following the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on the Minister not to read out four or five paragraphs from a press release, but to establish precisely the Government's agenda. Is there a secret agenda designed to weaken existing planning procedures, which have stood the test of time? No groundswell of criticism of them exists. The Minister must state the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister. He referred to the planning system's "customers" and listed them as developers and the public. Am I right to fear that the Government are again caving in to pressure from development companies and speculators?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to be suspicious. When we hear of the Government deregulating, complaining about cumbersome procedures and being frank enough—accidentally, perhaps—to put the interests of developers first, we can come to only one conclusion: the planning procedure will be streamlined, not as a means to safeguard consumers or citizens, but to help developers along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and, I dare say, Conservative Members, will have had experience of local decisions being overruled continually by the Secretary of State. Under the Bill, procedures will be streamlined to ensure that such decisions are overruled at the beginning of the process rather than at the end of a lengthy consultation in which the citizens' views will appear to have been regularly overruled by a Government who want to assist the interests of developers rather than to protect the interests of consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallic 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman. Development often means jobs for people in many areas. Recent criticism has been levelled at the slow rate of development planning in Scotland. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Robertson's Field. What a hypocrite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask me hon. Gentleman to withdraw that remark, which is unparliamentary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the word hypocrite, which is unparliamentary. I know that he will do so immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about Robertson's Field, on which the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) takes an opposite attitude to the one that he is expressing today. If that is not hypocritical, I do not know what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We were getting off to a fine start this morning. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1108</span>
not just the word hypocrite, but the word hypocritical as well. I know that, out of deference to the Chair, he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will withdraw them and use the word contradictory instead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Given the remarks of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), which will be recorded in 	<i>Hansard,</i> I must say that I see no relationship between the issue of Robertson's Field and the point that I made to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because the hon. Gentleman is stupid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I have now been called stupid by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The word stupid is not an unparliamentary remark. I have heard it applied to hon. Members by hon. Members on both sides of the House in Committee and on the Floor of the House. We accept the use of that word as part of the ordinary give and take of politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I accept what you say and I recognise that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is an expert in stupidity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We do not want any more bogus points of order. Let us settle down and listen to the hon. Member for Hamilton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to elevate the discussion. The hon. Member for Ayr and I were on the same side in the Robertson's Field saga. It is a piece of land in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, close to Burns' cottage, which is one of the most historic and revered sites in Scotland and has been protected as part of a green belt for many years. Recently, developers got planning permission from the local district council after years of trying. On the basis of creating jobs and leisure facilities, but mostly of creating money for developers, those developers have tried to develop that field. The hon. Gentleman and I have tried valiantly to persuade Kyle and Carrick district council that it should protect that site for the nation in a green belt. Therefore, the generality of the hon. Gentleman's comment that development equals jobs, which equals swift procedures to permit all development, is not necessarily the case on every occasion. Our planning procedures have been built up over the years to create a balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for taking an interest in Robertson's Field. The strange thing about that was the sudden about-turn by Provost Gibson McDonald and other Conservatives, which occurred after Sir Albert McQuarrie, the former Member of Parliament who was connected with the developer, had attended a Conservative group meeting. Is not that a matter of concern?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. Oddly, he and I do not share the same view about Robertson's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1109</span>
Field. I should mention that, in that case, the Robertson is no relation. I am not certain whether the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) also claims no parentage in connection with the famous Robertson's Field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly difficult to comprehend why the district council, which, over continuous administrations, has taken the view that that piece of green belt land should be protected in the national interest, suddenly changed its mind and agreed to a development. The matter raises several disturbing questions about the planning process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is talking about the planning process, would he agree that one of the important features of planning is that the Secretary of State can and will make judgments in the end about matters of great concern, that that protects all citizens, in the final analysis, and that we should not want that protection removed? That is particularly true of Members of Parliament who, in their constituency duties, often have to deal with problems concerning the added value that attaches to land—the hon. Gentleman is right about that—after planning permission has been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of the hon. Gentleman's comments, I hope that he will support my view and my suspicion of the Minister's sudden announcement today. A genuine question is raised about why, during a massive reorganisation, after the Government have issued a consultation document, they should tell us out of the blue—that is an important word—that the entire planning procedure system will be put up in the air, why should the interests of developers be mentioned in the statement as being somehow paramount?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is right. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House have encountered such circumstances, in which a finite national and local asset—the land—can be transformed by the grant of planning permission from something of commonplace value one day to an enormously valuable asset the next. An important balance exists between the designation of land as green belt and as development land, and that balance should be protected. Any announcement that suggests that that balance will be unilaterally changed should be greeted with considerable and grave caution and suspicion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that very point concerning green belt and the quality of the environment, is my hon. Friend aware that in my area an application has been made to turn the Inveravon farm into a tip for chemical and other wastes? Everyone is against that plan, but the one thing that people fear is that the matter will be taken out of their hands, and that despite the project's being contrary to the structure plan and the local plan, the application will be handed to the Secretary of State. They have no confidence in that procedure, because a local structure plan can be overruled if the Secretary of State considers that there is a development interest. The involvement of Ross Harper, a former prominent Conservative, who represents the company involved, gives them no confidence in the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to encourage hon. Members to intervene to bring up local cases, but I take my hon. Friend's point. I could mention a few myself, for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1110</span>
example, in relation to the Haugh head development in Uddingston in my constituency serious worries have been expressed that, despite the protections in local and structure plans and, allegedly, in the existing planning process, it is continually found that when the procedure reaches the level of the Secretary of State, local protections are overruled. It now appears that the Government propose to loosen those protections even further. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) rightly says, when the Minister categorised the planning system's "main customers" as developers first and the community at large second, he may have blown the secret agenda in his own words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was not a debate that we intend to embark on this morning. Indeed, we are keen to debate the issues in the next two clauses, especially those relating to the police and law and order. It is remarkable, however, that the Minister has taken the opportunity to come in this morning and spring on us something of enormous consequence. The Government have raised vital issues, which I believe that members on both sides of the Committee will find profoundly disturbing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister. I missed the first four sentences of his press release, because I was 30 seconds late for the start of the Committee, and I have not yet seen a copy. I share the misgivings that have been expressed by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). I cannot understand why, when we spent hours last week debating joint boards and joint committees, the Minister did not share his views with us then. It would have coloured the debate, certainly in view of the three groups of amendments to the clause which contained amendments in my name. It seems a bit strange; nothing that the Minister has said explains why he should wake up on a Tuesday and issue this press release.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made contributions regarding the planning problems. Indeed, he has had a letter from the Minister on that matter. Is it not possible—as I hope—that the Minister has responded and reacted to our debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not sound like that to me. If the Minister could have explained his thinking last week, it would have made our debates much more productive and our work much easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still puzzled as to the time scale allowed for this. I do not know how long the consultation period is, and what will flow from it. Are the Government considering changes to the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972—the primary legislation—by way of statutory instruments or Orders in Council, which provide all the statutory framework for some of these systems? It is not at all clear what the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that when the press release enters the public domain, concern will be expressed about the new emphasis that seems to be placed on the importance of satisfying the developers in the planning process. Communities in south-east Scotland, especially in Peebleshire, in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel), feel let down by the competing and conflicting claims of the developers on some of the new, relatively huge proposed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1111</span>
developments in northern Peebleshire and, to a lesser extent, in northern Berwickshire. The Secretary of State has overwritten the local structure plan and strategic planning process in a way that is inimical to the development of those communities. If the Government are seeking to loosen the existing protections via this mechanism, that will be greeted with dismay in many communities throughout Scotland, not simply in Peebleshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should have given us rather more of an explanation than the Minister caually reading a press release to the Committee. People outside the Committee must be coming to the conclusion that the ministerial team is treating the Committee casually. I certainly believe that to be true, considering that halfway through our debate on the clauses covering planning, a consultation process is suddenly announced, with no apparent long-term reason, no timetable and no futher explanation. It is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather differ from the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). It is not simply a question of treating the Committee casually; it is something a great deal more serious. The Bill is gradually being revealed as an extremely ill thought-out one. It is an absolute disgrace to the Scottish Office, with which I have had dealings ever since Sir David Milne was permanent secretary. It has never behaved like this before. I thought that it was a competent Department. It is not civil servants but Ministers who must take the responsibility. For hours on Thursday we debated clause 33 which is highly relevant to this. To come along this morning with such a statement shows how ill thought out is the Bill. Ministers should hang their heads in shame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about least disruption. What is the Scottish Office's assessment of the likely disruption? I promised my colleagues that I would be succinct. Over the weekend I had the opportunity to talk to the Law Society. Does the Minister believe that strategic planning is a necessary element in the development and control of a physical environment? Does he think that strategic planning goals should be pursued by way of structure plans? Why is the provision in schedule 4 on page 133 and clause 33 merely permissive? What provisions trigger the working of structure plans in the light of the creation of new authorities? Is it the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be better in some respects to have structure plans carried out by joint committees or boards under clause 20 because there is provision in schedule 4 and clause 33 to use joint boards under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972? It boils down to what is or what is not a cohesive structure. Schedule 4 states that where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authorities concerned are unable to agree on a joint structure plan … each authority may include in the plan submitted to the Secretary of State alternative proposals in respect of particular matters."</p></blockquote>
Local plans have to accord with a submitted structure plan, and planning applications have to have regard to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, if a submitted structure plan contains "alternative proposals", as is anticipated in schedule 4, what is its status in terms of local plan guidance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1112</span>
and development control? Secondly, how are reporters to view such a submitted plan when considering appeals against a local planning authority's refusal of planning permission or when dealing with a local plan inquiry? Thirdly, is not the simplest solution for the joint board or committee to submit its agreed structure plan without confusing alternative proposals and then to retain the present position where anyone or any authority can submit options to the Secretary of State? If those questions were answered we would be clear about what constitutes the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the National Planning Policy Guideline on "The Planning System", published by the Scottish Office in January 1994 the Government state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State aims to reach final decisions on structure plans within a year from the date of submission."</p></blockquote>
Having regard to the probability of submitted structure plans through schedule 4 having a number of alternative proposals attached to them, will there not be undue delay in approving them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the Secretary of State has had the 1992 Strathclyde structure plan update which has only 12 pages of text and associated tables and simply rolls the housing position forward from 1990–97 to 1992–99 since April 1993. A draft decision letter has not yet been issued. What confidence, therefore, can be placed in the speed with which structure plans submitted under schedule 4 will be approved? As the longest serving Scottish Member of Parliament, I have lost confidence in the Scottish Office and its Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On my innocent announcement about consultation on the details of structure planning, I should have thought that schedule 4 is clearly about the details of the planning system. Therefore, it is an appropriate time to announce that we are consulting openly about those details. Of course, we shall be open to the views of the public, community groups and developers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) sees a dark plot in that. He would not have seen that if he had bothered to attend the Committee last Thursday. He was not with us when we discussed these matters. Not only was he not here when we discussed structure planning, but he showed his utter contempt for those who have special educational needs in Scotland's schools by not attending that debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Is not it the business of Ministers to answer questions rather than to indulge in remarks that they know are cheap?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I was asked to move the amendment on special education on behalf of the Opposition and I take deep offence at the Minister's comments. Those on the Opposition Front Bench and Labour Members discussed in some detail the points that we would put to the Committee. We do not up and bust. It is deeply offensive to imply mat my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton and I were not in close co-operation about the submissions that I and other Labour Members made to the Committee. It is contemptible for the Minister to suggest that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not making any allegations against the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). Conservative Members listened with respect to his speech. However, it was not heard by the hon. Member for Hamilton because he was not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to let this go, but does not the Minister feel any pangs of conscience about using people with special educational needs for a cheap political stunt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will get back to schedule 4. I am obviously beginning to niggle Opposition Members. On the detail of schedule 4—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Falkirk, East wish to intervene? He does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to reassure the hon. Member for Hamilton by saying that the consultation paper will be open. The Secretary of State should keep the planning system under review to see whether improvements can be made in detail, which is the type of detail that schedule 4 sets out. My point was that we have received representations to the effect that the Government should use the opportunity of local government reorganisation to consider changes to the planning system other than those that flow inevitably from reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help us if the Minister would say from whom those representations came. Can he give us two or three examples? Now that I have the press release, I am even more worried. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Criticisms have been levelled … in terms of cumbersome procedures and delays in decision making."</p></blockquote>
Some complaints can come only from developers. Is the consultation process developer driven?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

I did that on behalf of my constituents, and I am not the only member of the Committee to have done so in the past 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He has made representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and to me. Many representations have been received over a period of time. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) knows that the Secretary of State acts in a quasi judicial capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More quasi than judicial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be aware that the focus of this week's 	<i>Estates Gazette</i> was on Scotland. Occupiers of offices and premises in Edinburgh
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1114</span>
were asked for their list of priorities, and listed the advantages and disadvantages of being located in Edinburgh. The main disadvantage listed was the attitude of the council. Will my hon. Friend point out why that is so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is one of the reasons why a review of the system—without any commitment to the results of the review—is sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the comments of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, may I give three names to my hon. Friend: Brodie, McGrouther and Dickie. They made representations in connection with the Robertson Field application and they have expressed frustration at the fact that the Secretary of State could not intervene in planning matters following Strathclyde's failure to pull in on structural plan deviation. The argument was that a local council should take a local decision—end of story. However, I welcome consultation and examination of planning procedures, as do many of my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks for many people who believe that is perfectly sensible to take a calm, detailed look at the planning system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not accept that it is obvious to anybody, expect those on me Conservative Benches who are prejudiced, that the proposal is a sheer piece of opportunism? Boundaries will be butchered and structure plans are in a state of chaos. A consultative plan is in the offing, but we now face the prospect of a total review of the planning system. That is a scandal. The Minister should accept that he is throwing the future of the planning process in Scotland in doubt, creating widespread dismay among developers and the public and destroying confidence in a system that has been painstakingly built up over 50 years. That is a disgrace. Will he comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. That was me hon. Gentleman's soundbite for the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows about planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) knows about planning. In the debate last Thursday—one of those that the hon. Member for Hamilton was unable to attend—I recognised that me hon. Member for Fife, Central had received training in planning. I emphasise that the structure planning process will be kept fully operational.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely clear that under schedule 4 structure planning will continue effectively during and after reorganisation. That relates to a point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow about the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spell out how the system will work in detail, because the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about mat. As I told him in a previous sitting, when authorities responsible for joint preparation of a structure plan cannot agree on any part of the plan's content, each authority may include alternative proposals in the plan submitted to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Linlithgow also asked about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1115</span>
Where alternative proposals are submitted, they must be accompanied by a statement of the reasoning behind them. That is without prejudice to the Secretary of State's consideration to prepare the plan himself—the final fallback power—under section 15 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 or to set up by his own hand a joint board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about present structure plans. Those plans continue in operation. In answer to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, I referred to the excellent paper by the director of planning of West Lothian district council, which was sent to the hon. Gentleman and to me with a covering letter from the convener.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter pointed out that in relation to Lothian, the present structure plan continues until 2001. The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked me about the Strathclyde structure plan amendments. We hope to reach decisions on them in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall put the question in a different way. I acknowledge that the Minister's letter to me, a copy of which the Committee received this morning, was helpful. If the consultation is valid, will he allow the admission of representations about the relative merits of joint boards and joint committees, which the Committee discussed on Thursday? Will that be part and parcel of the process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation process will be about the details of the planning system, but the short answer is that it would be difficult to avoid people putting their views on joint boards, joint committees and the relative merits of voluntary and other structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my reply should have been briefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that that will be a central feature of the consultation paper, which will be about the details of the planning system and delays, but we are open to receiving the views of the public, communities and developers about joint committees and joint boards. We do not envisage a change to the Bill's provisions, which will be on the statute book before the consultations have been completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister does not propose to change the Bill's legislative framework, does he propose to change the legislative framework of the 1972 planning Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not envisage major changes in primary legislation as a result of the consultations, but changes to secondary legislation and in particular to the guidelines that are sent by the Scottish Office to planning authorities. That is the area of change that we are looking at. This is a detailed consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that those who are serious about the economic well-being of Scotland will not wish to be associated with an overrestrictive planning system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1116</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we certainly do not want an overrestrictive planning system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that his constituents wanted a very restrictive planning system when it came to Pilmuir quarry. They did not want it at all. The Minister was one of those who objected to it. Will he guarantee here and now that the rights which he and his constituents have already enjoyed to object to a quarry will be sacrosanct and safeguarded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes a remarkable interest in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone has to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley like to get up to explain that remark?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) makes a fair general point. I am happy to assure him that there is no suggestion that we will in any way restrict rights of objection to planning proposals. The question of neighbour notification which was at the heart of the Pilmuir quarry argument is one that we will look at in the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is quite clear that hon. Members can support a policy of improvement and development to bring jobs to Scotland while at the same time objecting to matters that they might find offensive in their constituencies? There is nothing odd about that; it goes on all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend accurately describes the views of hon. Members on both sides of the political debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister also give the Committee an assurance that the findings of a structure plan will still weigh as heavily in the considerations of any appointee of the Secretary of State when he or she is considering an appeal by a developer? The structure plans are normally the fundamental document upon which the Secretary of State's reporter finds his judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is yes. I am glad to be able to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister understand why some of us are wary of a Government who consult sometimes during the passage of a Bill or, as in this case, after its passage? Were those problems not foreseen before the Bill was created? What guarantees can he give that there will not be undue delay in the structure plans in this more complex system that he is introducing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are committed to avoiding delay in the structure planning process. As I have already said, a large number of structure plans are already in existence and will be for a considerable period of time. I think that I have already answered the hon. Gentleman's first question but I can do so again. We received representations that there should be a review of the planning system in terms of legislation as part of the Bill. We took the view that it would be much better to let the new reorganisation system bed down rather than combine with that changes to the planning system. Therefore, we are keeping the system, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1117</span>
are consulting on detailed changes in workability and examining the planning guidelines. That is the correct decision because it puts the stability of the planning system ahead of other considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend assure me and other members of the Committee that the Government have understood and taken into account the example of Rosyth? There were massive demonstrations and objections to the proposals to obtain planning approval to base nuclear submarines at Rosyth. Later, the same people demonstrated and objected when they thought that they would lose them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point about public opinion. It is not appropriate for me to comment on individual planning applications because of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quasi-judicial function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question which I asked earlier but which the Minister has not found time to answer. What is the time scale? The Minister has just said that he will wait until the new local authority structure beds down. Presumably, that will be two or three years after 1 April 1996. When will the changes that he expects to flow from the consultation come into effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. I have not answered that question. We envisage issuing the consultation paper in the reasonably near future and envisage a period of several months for responses to it. We must then assess the responses and decide what action needs to be taken. There is no absolute cut-off date. As I have said, there will probably be changes in the guidelines that are issued to planning authorities thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that we do not intend to alter the balance of development and of conservation interests. We want a proper appraisal to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The objective of the review is to strengthen, not weaken, the planning system and to improve it by consent among all involved, although many different interests will respond to the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have given helpful background to schedule 4 and to the way in which we envisage the progress of the planning system in Scotland. I commend the schedule to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few final remarks in response to what the Minister has said. He has sprung on us today a major and significant announcement that will worry people throughout Scotland. In relation to his opening jibes, I must say that the problem for the people of Scotland is not my temporary absence from the Committee, but the continual presence of the Minister. His announcements emphasise that only too well. When he says that the Government will make changes not in primary, but in secondary legislation through guidelines, anyone who was suspicious before will be even more suspicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I smell a rat and I am not alone in that. What we have heard today is not an innocent statement. It is an open consultation. As I am sure that many people outside the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1118</span>
Committee will agree, the announcement has been designed not to strengthen, but to weaken, the existing planning procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to apologise to the Committee for something that I said in my opening remarks. If I made a mistake, I am always willing to rectify it. The National Planning Policy Guideline document from which I quoted was not a consultation document, but a conclusion. Two months ago, in January, the Government published the "National Planning Policy Guideline. The Planning System" for the planning procedures. So this is not a matter on which they had an open mind: they have had deliberations on it, and drawn conclusions. The document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) sets out the Government's objectives for the planning system, outlines the legislative and administrative framework within which planning policies are formed and implemented, and indicates how the coordination of planning and control can guide development while safeguarding the natural and built environment. It is intended to guide authorities, professionals and the public."</p></blockquote>
Eight weeks later, the Minister tells us that unnamed concerned bodies have led him to conclude that he must now look at the entire planning system and change it, not through primary legislation—which would require a full debate in the House—but through secondary legislation and an alteration to an eight-week-old document that would allow the Government to move with their agenda in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a suspicious and sinister move. It seems directly intended to undermine confidence in the existing planning system and to streamline it in the interests of the developer lobby to which the Government seem so close. The whole system is being targeted, and I think that we are right to conclude that there is a hidden agenda to change the balance in the system away from local people and their elected councillors to developers and their friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's contention that this move is in line with the citizens charter should be rephrased. This has less to do with the citizens charter and more with a developers charter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The press release is a dishonour to the Scottish Office. It would be a dishonour to the Scottish press if they accepted it in a spoon-fed frame of mind, and printed it as it stands. If members of the Scottish press are worthy of the honourable profession of journalists, they would do well to ask a number of further questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that I have had time to read the thing properly, I note that the Minister says in the press release:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should stress however, that whatever changes may eventually be decided, it is our intention to maintain the stability and continuity of the present system, particularly with regard to structure planning."</p></blockquote>
Where does the threat to stability and continuity come from? It comes from the Bill. That is the only threat that exists. The main risk to stability and continuity arises from the proposed reorganisation of local government, and from nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, it should be noted that the Minister has consistently accepted that there is no need for a fundamental change in the planning system, given what he calls its proven success. This is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 419, in page 28, line 10, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and all existing uniformed and non-uniformed staff shall be retained by the forces'.</p></blockquote>
The Minister highlighted the fact that clauses 34 and 35 are important because they deal with the important issue of the future of—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Is it in order for the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) to leave the Committee, having viciously attacked my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton for being out of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no control over the movement of hon. Members, thank goodness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the future of the Scottish police forces. We wish to discuss the first of two important items—police personnel. Under clause 35, we shall wish to discuss the issue of amalgamation, with particular reference to our fear that the Secretary of State is moving towards a national police force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 419 would take account of that because—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order, Sir James. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Hamilton to take off after the Minister, given the importance of the comments being made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it absolutely clear that the movement of hon. Members has nothing to do with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1120</span>
the Chair. From my experience, which goes back to when I was first elected in 1964, hon. Members go in and out of Committees all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear, Sir James, that you will have to answer many points or order interruptions because Conservative Members do not want to discuss this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 15 years it has been drummed into the mind of every Scot that the Conservative party is the party of law and order. In reality it is the party that has run away from law and order. The Conservative Government have created and administered over more lawlessness in Scotland than have any Government this century. Therefore, I fear, Sir James, that there will be more irrelevant interruptions and bogus points of order, as we have had from the hon. Member for Ayr.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there is no proposed change in the geographical areas covered by our police forces or in operational matters, it should be clear that all existing police force personnel should be transferred. My question to the Minister is why the Bill does not provide for them to be automatically transferred. What have the Government to fear from acknowledging the excellent work done by Scottish police personnel and from reflecting that in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are thrown back to our discussion about staff generally. The Government have refused to provide in the Bill for the transfer of every member of police staff in Scotland when the reorganisation takes place. Why does the clause still leave uncertainty over the future of personnel? The amendment is designed to allow us to argue the case for the transfer at reorganisation of every uniformed and civilian member of the police service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, but it is important to set in context what they have been doing in relation to the rise in lawlessness in Scotland and to police personnel in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman tell us whether the intention with regard to numbers of policemen employed would be to keep them at current levels in the future, given the flexibility that is now available to regions such as Strathclyde? It is important, because over the years Strathclyde has consistently undermanned the police force. Now, when it sees disbandment on its way, it has suddenly announced that it is to find another 180 policemen to make the numbers up, after 20 years of failure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an excellent conference at the weekend, but even the euphoria which built up there could not allow me this morning to guarantee future levels of personnel in the police service before they are appointed. I think that I will be forgiven for not pursuing the idiotic suggestion that has just been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980 in Scotland there was a combination of crime and offences totalling 725,546—nearly 750,000. By 1992 that had risen to 1,023,458. The law and order party had, over 12 years, managed to achieve a 41 per cent. increase in the number of crimes and offences committed. I am sure that the Minister will want to explain away that statistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to personnel in Scottish police forces, there were 13,206 in 1980, but in 1992 that number had risen to merely 12,872. A 5 per cent. increase was made in personnel to deal with a 41 per cent. increase in crime and offences. It does not need a genius to work out that there

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1121</span>
has been little investment in front line troops to fight crime in Scotland. It is a disgrace. The figures reveal that beyond the rhetoric and behind the statements of Scottish Office Ministers are record crime levels and appalling levels of police personnel to tackle them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is concerned with our wish for the transfer of all the police personnel, and for a boost in their morale when their confidence in the Government has slumped, so that they can continue to do their excellent job. The question is also raised of how the Government can continue to be economical with the truth in tackling the relevant issues in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to hear this morning that the Government will transfer all staff. We want the Government to explain why the response to an explosion of crime and lawlessness has been a pathetic increase in police personnel. We also want the Minister to tell us why the Government will stalk the country extolling the virtues of Tory law and order, while its opposite can be found in every street, community and town in Scotland. We are not in the mood for humbug and hypocrisy from Ministers or for attempts by them to explain away the explosion of crime that is intimidating elderly people and damaging the confidence of people in the police and courts services. The Government have been in power for 15 sad years, so they have no excuses to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have moved the amendment to test the good will of the Government. Scotland will no longer tolerate the absolute nonsense that we hear from the Government. We must get to grips with law and order. It would be a good start if the Minister were able not only to transfer the staff and boost morale, but say how the Government will build up police numbers over the next few months. I was about to say few years, but the great thing is that they will not have a few years, the way that they are going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central used the words "absolute nonsense". That is a precise description of the content of his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member talked of humbug and hypocrisy. If ever there was humbug and hypocrisy, it was evident in the words of the hon. Gentleman, particularly because for as long as he has been a Member of Parliament he has voted against almost every measure to give the police additional powers to deal with the problems that they face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of absolute nonsense, will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee and Scotland whether meeting a 41 per cent. increase in crime with a 5 per cent. increase in personnel is a sensible way of tackling the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman looks down a narrow channel. The number of police officers, the powers given to them, the court back-up and our sentencing policies come together and must be evaluated to determine the real reasons why crime has increased in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the number of police officers in the Strathclyde regional council area. Since its inception, Strathclyde has run the police force with a lower level of manning than the Government catered for and recommended. Staff numbers was the responsibility of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1122</span>
Strathclyde regional council, the "responsible" authority that we are going to get rid of. Police recruitment will be assisted by its abolition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of absolute nonsense, will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee why there has been an increase of 297,000 crimes and offences over the past 12 years? Will he tell the Committee and Scotland why a crime is being committed every 30 seconds? Is that "absolute nonsense" or is he trying to throw doubt on to the figures produced by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not. I accept the hon. Gentleman's figures, but he did not pick up on the point that detection rates have risen considerably in the same period. Court practices and procedures relating to the treatment of juvenile criminals in particular have changed. Those procedures have allowed for 15 youngsters in my constituency to have 850 criminal offences lodged against them. The crime rate does not come down to a problem with the police, but to the problems with children's panels and the activities of the procurator and within our sheriff courts. We must take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be confronted by his own logic. Unfortunately, we have not been in government for 15 years; the Tories have. Why, if there are so many problems in his constituency, does the hon. Gentleman criticise the Scottish Office for failing to address law and order issues there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I address this issue day and daily with the Scottish Office. The matter was addressed at the time of the election. People know my views. The Government whom I support have not done as well on law and order as I would have expected. I have made such comments quite publicly outside this place. Perhaps one of the reasons why I was elected was to encourage them to be a bit sterner and to close their ears to the words that come so repeatedly from Opposition Members. The "softly, softly, treat them very kindly" mode has played a major part in creating many of the crimes that the hon. Gentleman described. I should like to return—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I allowed the debate to go a bit wide, but I should not like it to go too wide. We should concentrate on the amendment rather than on crime waves in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being led astray by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. The amendment deals with police numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about the understaffing of Strathclyde police. Is he aware that one of the reasons for that is that successive chief constables in Strathclyde have been given a choice about how to spend money? In several cases, they decided to spend money on providing a helicopter rather than on individual beat constables. Would the hon. Gentleman accept that that is a professional judgment by the head of the police service which he views as sensible, but which allows the hon. Gentlemen to make his point about police understaffing? It is not possible simply to point to police manning or staffing levels as a sole criterion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1123</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strathclyde regional council has consistently underfunded the police service. That means that the police chief constable has had to make decisions which he felt to be operationally satisfactory to his remit. But at the same time, given the limit on his budget and the underfunding from Strathclyde, he could not provide the number of policemen that he would have required. I make these points briefly. I intended to stick totally to the argument about the number of police in the service. I have made my point on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave the hon. Gentleman to make a speech if he so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is the proof of a long order pudding. It is a tangible statement on commitment and specifically deals with personnel within the police force. It seeks to ensure that police staffing levels are maintained during reorganisation, something that the general public would not just find acceptable, but would positively support. If police force boundaries do not change, surely the numbers of police staff should not change either. That is at the heart of the amendment. I should like to hear the Government addressing that point. Why is there a need for a change in police numbers? Why is that guarantee not written into the Bill? There is no less a job for the police to do. The public certainly wish greater police involvement and at a more local level. They want more beat policemen who are closer to them and their problems and more able to deal with them. The public do not want any reduction in police numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that each of the police authorities that will be established will be able to take account of the public view and fund accordingly so that the public can have what they want?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would guarantee that. If the hon. Gentleman believes that, I hope that he will support the amendment. There is a difference between that and hope for the future. We have heard of too many hopes for the future instead of being offered guarantees. In the previous debate we heard that everything will happen after the Bill becomes an Act. We are asked to take a great deal on trust. I am a bit fed up of the Government always asking us to trust them. I do not trust them and the public are entitled not to trust them. If the hon. Gentleman wants that trust to be established, why does not he support the amendment and include it in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wants to establish the numbers of police at current levels. I have demonstrated already that Strathclyde is undermanned. The proposals mean that that will change. The Bill allows for the expansion of police forces in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government do not allow for the expansion of police forces—that is the opposite of the Sheehy report's intentions. I want the current staffing level to be maintained during the transition period, after which it will be for the new authorities to decide on increasing numbers. The only way to guarantee the maintenance of present numbers is through the amendment, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support. After reorganisation, the new councils will decide on numbers of staff, which I hope that they will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1124</span>
The amendment would provide an opportunity to gurantee police numbers. The heartfelt and often expressed public desire is for more rather than fewer police personnel and, at the very least, mere should be no change. The amendment would ensure that. The back-up staff, which allow front-line police to do their work, will be required just as much after reorganisation as now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government foresee reductions in police numbers? If so, why would they want to lower police numbers at a time of high crime rates? How would the so-called party of law and order ensure crime prevention and detection with fewer numbers of police than exist now? The amendment would guarantee that the numbers would stay the same during the transition period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst aspects of the Sheehy report were, thankfully, dumped, and it would be ridiculous if some of the fears expressed during the debate on the report were to be realised through local government reorganisation. Duties such as community policing, allied to front-line crime fighting, require full establishments in each Scottish police force as well as adequate ancillary back-up. Can the Government give assurances about those numbers, post-reorganisation? If not, why not? Local authorities have already been faced with tight budgets and much of the reform means that money will be spent on the reorganisation itself and will reduce the cash available for services. Can the Government guarantee the continuation of numbers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental problem is straightforward. If there are no geographical or operational changes to the areas served by the Scottish police forces, staffing levels should not be affected and the Government should have no trouble in accepting the amendment for the transition period. Even if they will not include in the Bill such a safeguard, will the Minister give the Committee a categorical assurance on those matters? He has the opportunity today of setting aside our fears by giving that assurance, although I should prefer an inbuilt guarantee. If the Minister wishes to reduce police numbers when crime rates are high, he will simply not be forgiven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of the hon. Member for Ayr who temporarily left the Committee Room, let me remind hon. Members what the amendment would do. It would insert at the end of new section 21B of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and all existing uniformed and non-uniformed staff shall be retained by the forces."</p></blockquote>
In Other words, it would not freeze at existing levels the future numbers of police in Scotland. It would guarantee that there would be no reduction in police numbers in future and would leave open the possibility that there would be more policemen and other police workers in Scotland. We all want that. However, the amendment would not leave open the possibility that the number of police would be reduced. Therefore, will the Minister tell us why the Government are not prepared to guarantee that the number of policemen will not be reduced? If the Government will not accept the amendment, the only implication is that the Government figure that under their regime the number of policemen will fall as a direct result of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr argued that it should be left to the new authorities, which will form the joint
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1125</span>
committees in charge of police forces, to decide whether they increase police numbers. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the document "Serving Scotland's Needs", which was made available this week by the Secretary of State for Scotland. It covers the expenditure of the departments for which the Secretary of State is responsible. Page 88 of the document refers to the funding for police authorities and paragraph 5.18 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Approved expenditure by police authorities attracts specific grant at the rate of 51 per cent. This is intended to encourage authorities to give priority to the police service in line with the Government's public commitment to law and order."</p></blockquote>
The key word is "approved". It is not up to local authorities to determine the level of policing in their areas. The level of policing needs to be approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland before authorities can receive a 51 per cent. grant to increase provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the level of policing were a matter for local authorities, the number of police in Scotland would have increased significantly in recent years. Local authorities always have to obtain the Secretary of State's approval. That is why the level of policing has not increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the words that the hon. Gentleman has just used, will he explain why Strathclyde region has consistently undermanned its police force in relation to approved levels for the past 15 to 20 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman forgets that the Secretary of State for Scotland has continually capped authorities such as Strathclyde when they sought to increase expenditure. Strathclyde has other priorities on which it has to spend money. If the Government removed the capping powers on local authorities and allowed them to spend at the levels that they wish, I am sure that Strathclyde would match the approved level of policing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend reflect on what is happening in Fife region? In the past few months, it has asked the Government for 21 more uniformed police officers because it is facing tremendous problems of crime and lawlessness. That application was turned down. It reinforces the point that the new authorities will not be able to do any more than current authorities because of the dead hand of this so-called law-and-order Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Like me, he has served on regional councils and on police and fire committees. It was a recurrent experience on such committees for the police constable to come along to seek to increase the number of policemen. That needed approval before it could be done. We had to stick to the numbers that had been approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland through the chief of constabulary. No authority was ever allowed to increase the number of the police as it wished. It had to obtain approval if it was to obtain the 51 per cent. funding that comes from central Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Ayr does not understand that, then he should do. If he now understands the issue, he should consider carefully how he will vote on the amendment. If he is concerned to have a guaranteed level of policing in Scotland that will not be reduced, he had better vote for the amendment. If he votes against it, we shall know that he does not mean what he says about his concern for law and order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I totally dispute what the hon. Gentleman says. However, he has still not answered my question about Strathclyde. Will he return to that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must know that my experience is in Dundee and Tayside. I do not know the details of what has gone on in Strathclyde. I do not represent a constituency in that area. However, I am aware that Strathclyde regional council has done more good than almost any other authority in Scotland. That is one of the reasons why the Government are after Strathclyde regional council and have introduced the Bill. Strathclyde has the population base and the resources to provide the services that people want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend read the annual report of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde, in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The additional finance provided by the Regional Council and to which I referred in last year's report, has produced over two hundred extra police officers on the streets. This has facilitated high profile and covert police operations to be targeted successfully at specific problems, such as firearms, housebreakings, knives and car thefts."</p></blockquote>
Does not that give the lie to what Conservative Members have been saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member seems to be concentrating on Strathclyde. However, the amendment relates to the new police authorities so perhaps the hon. Member could be more general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The word "lie" was used in relation to what I was saying. May I explain matters? If the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley had been here earlier—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—he would have heard me refer to the consistent undermanning of Strathclyde police since their inception. I entirely accepted that Strathclyde's intent is now to build up the numbers. Perhaps that clarifies the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would guarantee that there would be no reduction in the number of police available to the new authorities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central rightly drew the Committee's attention to the actual increase in the number of police in recent years compared with the actual increase in crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document which has only just become available to Members of Parliament makes exactly the point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central. It compares the figures for 1988–89 with those for 1992–93, the most recent figures that are available to Parliament. It says that the average police strength rose by just under 4 per cent. over those years. But, there was a 25 per cent. increase in recorded crime. In response, the hon. Member for Ayr said to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central that there has been a massive increase in the number of crimes cleared up during that period. However, that is not so. According to the same document, there was only an 11 per cent. increase in the offences that were cleared up. That is better than a 4 per cent. increase in the number of police, but it is not better than a 25 per cent.

increase in recorded crime. One reason why the number of offences that have been cleared up is not significantly higher is that there are not enough police because the Government are not prepared to back the local authorities in paying for the numbers of police that are needed in Scotland. This is especially important in my area of Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, on the Table in the Committee a news release was made available to help hon. Members with the debate on these matters. It is from Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and it was circulated in July 1993. It refers to police operations being unchanged by council reforms—according to the Minister who is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staffing lies at the heart of the issue. It forms a significant part of the costs that are met by local authorities for police operations. The police budget is largely taken up by staffing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement by Lord Fraser, makes it clear that a new joint committee will be needed to look after the Tayside police force in my area. On page 2 of that press release, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Individual councils and joint committees will meet the actual costs of policing within their council areas."</p></blockquote>
That means that Perthshire and Kinross, Angus and Dundee will have to meet the costs of Tayside police. Dundee has approximately 155,000 of the people in the Tayside area. The figure for Perth and Kinross is about 125,000 and for Angus it is 129,000. When broken down into percentages, that means that about 38 per cent. of the population is in Dundee, 31 per cent. is in Perth and Kinross and about 32 per cent. is in Angus. The Tayside police force is currently funded by Tayside council tax payers. No account is taken of the populations living in each of those three areas. Quite simply, the cost of the policing operation in Tayside is met by the council taxpayers in Tayside, along with the special grants made available by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen after the reform of local government and after a joint committee is established? Will the cost of the entire Tayside policing operation be met by the three councils in proportion to their population, or will it be in proportion to the level of crime in their areas? Is it intended that if there is a higher level of crime in Dundee, more of the money has to be spent in Dundee, or will it simply be a case of Dundee having 38 per cent. of the police budget because Dundee has 38 per cent. of the population?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Angus could say that because they make up 31 per cent. of the population, they want 31 per cent. of the police resources. That means that the chief constable could be told that he must move police away from the Dundee area into Angus and into Perth and Kinross because, in terms of what Angus pay for policing, it is demanding its money's worth. That might cut right across the chief constable's priorities for policing in Tayside. Is the Minister saying that because crime is higher in Dundee and there is a greater need for police in the area, council tax payers in Angus and in Perth and Kinross must subsidise police operations in Dundee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the position is made clear. Section 19(2) of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 refers to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1128</span>
amalgamation schemes which will disestablish existing police forces, establish new police forces, appoint the new chief constable, and so on. Subsection (2)(d) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the payment by the constituent authorities in such proportions as may be specified in the scheme of the expenditure incurred by the joint police committee in the performance of the functions delegated to them".</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? How much will the constituent authorities be expected to pay for policing? Will they be expected to pay whatever policing costs are incurred on the basis of priorities established by the police, or will an authority be able to insist that if it pays, say, 31 per cent. of the budget, it should have 31 per cent. of the resources in its area? That is a vital point which must be clarified before we go any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like me, the hon. Member for Tayside, North, will have received documentation from Tayside regional council drawing attention to the social priority areas in Tayside. It compares the levels of poverty and unemployment in Tayside in 1981 with those in 1991, following the new census figures. Unemployment in Tayside was 11·65 per cent. in 1981—it has now come down significantly to 9·37 per cent. However, the Dundee figure for 1991 is 13·65 per cent.—still above the level for Tayside in 1981, and well above the level for Tayside in 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true with permanent sickness. In Tayside in 1981, people who were permanently sick accounted for only 2·33 per cent. of the population. That has gone up to 4·65 per cent. of the population in Tayside as a whole, but in Dundee the figure is 6·36 per cent. of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Tayside in 1981, low income groups accounted for 25·67 per cent. of the population. In 1991, the figure was 26·63 per cent., but in Dundee the figure was 27·8 per cent. Dundee has a higher proportion of single parents, and so on. Deprivation is focused on particular areas of the city. Certain parts have higher levels of unemployment and poverty, more people on low incomes, a greater percentage of single parents and, as a result, there is a higher level of crime and a greater need for policing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that in Linlathen in mid-Craigie, which I know very well, the so-called single parent problem was fairly prevalent. However, those single parents were different—they were war widows. If my memory serves me correctly, they were not a social problem—quite the opposite. The way that they brought up their children was a credit to the community. The problem of unmarried mothers is entirely different. Single parents were common where I grew up, in Linlathen in mid-Craigie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members seem to want to smear single parents. I am simply drawing the Committee's attention to the report from Tayside regional council which identifies social and economic conditions in certain parts of the area, mainly in pockets of Dundee, where there are social and economic problems and higher levels of crime and vandalism and all the petty offences that can have serious implications.

A member of my Labour party branch in Dundee lived on the Kirkton estate and was continually bothered by kids throwing stones at his window and calling him names. Eventually he became so upset that he went to remonstrate and one of the kids took a stick to him and hit him across the legs. The man was ill. He went back inside, had a heart

attack and died. He would have been helped by the presence of policemen on foot patrol in his area to protect him from such incidents. That does not happen, because there are not enough police. I am worried that there will be even fewer police in future, unless the amendment is accepted. That is why the matter is very serious and important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman about the matter's seriousness and importance. However, he draws attention to circumstances in Dundee. I remind him that the 51st Highland division was captured at St. Valery. Its members were, largely, either captured or dead. Many of the mothers and wives lived in Linlathen in mid-Craigie because their sons and husbands were Territorial Army soldiers. In the street where I lived, every house was occupied by someone who would today be called a single parent—whose husband was either in a prisoner or war camp, or dead. We had one policeman on a bicycle to cover the whole area from Linlathen to Trottick and all around. The hon. Gentleman knows the areas that I am describing. We did not have me difficulties that he describes. We are dealing with different circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going a little wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not introduce the 51st Highland division into the debate. I am happy to return to Dundee to tell people that the Tories in this Committee are not worried about policing levels in such areas and would deal with the problems affecting people there by putting a few extra bobbies on bikes. However, I do not think that Tory councillors in Dundee would be too happy with interventions such as we have just had from the hon. Member for Tayside, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that we are discussing concerns not only the policing of particularly bad parts of areas such as Tayside, but special circumstances, such as the cost of conferences. The Labour party conference was held in Dundee at the weekend. That did not cost a great deal in extra policing, because the Labour party are quite welcome in Dundee and there is no police problem. But what happens when the Tory party conference is held in Perth? What happens when the Prime Minister attends that conference? There is a massive cost for policing, and it is met out of the Tayside police budget. Who will pay for that? Will people in Dundee suddenly agree to provide, through a joint committee, the £250,000 that is required to police the Tory conference in Perth? I do not think so. There will be great pressure to argue for funds to be spent in Dundee and not diverted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many extra police were sent to Dundee to deal with the Timex dispute. Many police came from Perth and Kinross or from Angus to help the Dundee police, because of the need for extra resources. What will happen under a joint committee? Will members complain, "We are being expected to pay for the policing of an incident in another local authority area, which does not directly affect people in our area"? None of those issues has been tackled by the Government. We do not know what will happen. Before a decision is made on the amendment or the clause, we want answers to our questions. Do the Government even begin to understand the changes that they are forcing through in this Bill? The police would never have suggested changes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1130</span>
such as those introduced in clauses 35 and 36, which will not help them in their task in Scotland, but are being made simply for gerrymandering purposes for the Tory party there. Those changes will wreck council services and place the police under additional unnecessary strain, when crime is rising above any level that most of us have experienced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am happy to accept the principle of the amendment, which is supported by COSLA. New section 21B of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 provides that the police forces prior to reorganisation shall continue in existence after reorganisation. As a consequence, there is no need to make further provision for the transfer of police officers to the new police forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to accept the principle that civilians employed by police authorities for the assistance of police officers under section 9 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 should transfer to the new police authorities. The amendment refers also to uniformed staff, police officers, who are covered by the Bill's terms.

The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked about the increase in crime since 1980. Recent figures and trends in recorded crime show a decrease. The latest figures for crime for the period to September 1993 show that recorded crime decreased by 8 per cent. in the first nine months of 1993, compared with the same period in 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, non-sexual crimes of violence decreased by 15 per cent., crimes of dishonesty decreased by 10 per cent., and crimes of fire raising and vandalism decreased by 9 per cent. Early indications for 1993 as a whole are that the recorded crime figures supplied to and published by the Scottish Office will substantiate the all-Scotland decrease noted in the Strathclyde police press release of 10 March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggests that the trends may be changing, but does not he agree that an increase of a quarter of a million crimes and offences since 1980 is unacceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Crime has increased steadily over the past 30 years, but it is encouraging that in Scotland there appears to be a trend in the opposite direction, which is what we all want.

I pay tribute to Strathclyde. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr raised the question of Strathclyde being underpoliced, but police numbers are being brought up to strength, which is a step in the right direction. A considerable number of officers have been released for operational duties because of civilian staff increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of reasons for the decrease in crime in Strathclyde. First, an injection of funds to the police budget by the regional council brought civilian staff into police offices, releasing 200 officers to police the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the development of computers and technology within the force speeded up processes, saving police time. Thirdly, good use was made of unmanned automatic detection devices. Fourthly, the licensing authorities have strictly controlled licensing hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, there was a series of well targeted operations, including Operation Bud, which was directed against housebreaking; Operation Spur, which netted 656 illegal firearms and resulted in more than 200 arrests; Operation Interlock, following three murders in the east end of Glasgow, which resulted in 681 arrests for offences from murder to breach of the peace; Operation Dove, which resulted in 570 arrests and brought calm to the constituency of the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster); Operation Hawk, which resulted in 68 arrests for murder, drugs trafficking, housebreaking and firearms offences; Operation Swamp in Glasgow city centre, which led to several hundred arrests; and the well-known Operation Blade, during which 4,569 weapons were surrendered and 30,000 people were stopped and searched. As a result of the measures, individually and in total, knife-related crime decreased dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police activity is not the only part of the story. The police require me support of other agencies and the community. That is why the crime prevention panels, neighbourhood watch groups, victim support schemes, schools, estate committees and youth groups have a vital role to play. I have good news for the hon. Member for Fife, Central. Capital allocations are making allowance for new police headquarters in Fife, which will greatly assist policing in his area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition do not object to what the Minister is saying, but I must put one point to him. Last year I was a witness in Ayr sheriff court and spoke to some police witnesses who are worried about the huge amount of police time that is taken up by great numbers of police hanging around sheriff courts, the High Court and district courts. I know that the Government are reviewing the procedures and are considering the possibility of better timetabling trials and other hearings. Can that be speeded up? It is disgraceful that policemen who should be out on the beat and doing proper police work are tied up for days and sometimes for weeks waiting to give evidence in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's remarks, not least because I practised in the courts for the short time that I was an interim procurator fiscal. A good fiscal always allows the police officers to get away as quickly as possible. However, there is a presumption of innocence and if accused people can see the evidence against them when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1132</span>
they appear in court and realise that that evidence is likely to be proved, they are more likely to plead guilty. If the witnesses are not present, they may not be as inclined to do so. Individual fiscals or prosecutors are entitled to take a pragmatic approach. I accept the hon. Gentleman's general principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never suggest that witnesses, particularly police witnesses, should not be called. However, there are problems with timetabling. Sheriff clerks or fiscals can be overcautious and have too many witnesses hanging around for too long in too many cases. Courts are not there just for the convenience of administration. The police have a vital role in the streets and should not be made to hang around courts unnecessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not unsympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is far removed from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Fife, Central raised the subject of Government funding. Spending on the criminal justice system has increased in real terms by about 50 per cent. The capital allocations for 1994–95 will be £14·2 million. The provisional allocations for the following year will be £15·7 million and for 1996–97 will be £19·7 million. The establishment of headquarters in the hon. Gentleman's area is an important step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After reorganisation, the specific grant for the police will be paid at 51 per cent. of current expenditure. Specific grant will be subject to a cash limit. Police authorities will be free to decide their share of expenditure. At the same time, the Secretary of State's controls over police establishment will be removed. That provision is in clause 41 of the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the context of another Bill that is passing through the House, we know that the Government intend to alter the law to empower Scottish police officers to make arrests south of the border and to appear in court there. English police officers will have equivalent powers. Clearly, that will give rise to additional police costs that will be associated with local government reorganisation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak but I shall make a brief contribution because of some of the comments that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 419 should be considered very seriously. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister has said that the Government accept the principle behind it. It is important not to make adjustments to police manning levels because of the demands and pressures that are put upon them. They must continue as they are now. That is vital. It is quite wrong for the hon. Member for Dundee, East constantly to harp on about social problems on the basis that he is making a social case. When I intervened earlier I drew his attention to the fact that the second world war produced many single parents. The mothers who were left to bring up children alone did a remarkable job. That is what we should remember when we look at police manning levels. They should not be adversely affected by the present social circumstances. That was the only point I was making. As ever the hon. Gentleman tried to make a political point out of a serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that the police are increasingly being asked to deal with social problems that are not really policing matters? They are sent in simply because, in the past 10 to 15 years, the Government have tried to deal, albeit insufficiently, with the symptoms of crime. They have never dealt with its causes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to place it clearly on the record that I do not believe that poor people become criminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither do I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good. Too often politicians try to make a political point when there is a social problem that should be dealt with. In the present circumstances, particularly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1135</span>
relating to attendance at court and other matters that were mentioned earlier, the police not only find themselves involved in dealing with current social problems but are consequently unable to devote as much time to police patrols. I agree that there is a need to have more policemen on the beat. One bobby on his bike was a pretty good deterrent. One never knew when he would appear. The policeman's presence is what matters. The visible blue uniform is the real deterrent. That is why the present manning levels should be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate. We are pleased that the Minister has decided to accept the principle. I hope that he will make it absolutely clear in the legislation that the existing police personnel, uniformed and civilian, will be transferred to the new joint boards. That is crucial, as the Minister has confirmed. That said, and far be it from me to raise a wider issue than this one, we argued weeks ago that other employees in local government should enjoy the same benefits under this reorganisation. If we accept that argument today—we shall withdraw the amendment on that basis—the ability to transfer of staff should apply not only to the police services but should be extended throughout every service that is being discussed as part of the reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the decrease in crime in the Govan Initiative area, which has been sustained over a period and has been brought about not only by increased police action, but by the resources spent by the local authorities and by non-uniformed, non-police staff who have co-operated and co-ordinated with the police?

There is a genuine worry that if the police staff is maintained and other local authority staffs are not, the nature of the partnership will change and that the decline in crime figures, which depends on non-police staff co-operating, will be reversed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) and want to put on record the praise of Labour Members for the Govan Initiative. My hon. Friend highlighted the point about partnership and co-operation on the front line. It may be that similar results could be achieved in such projects throughout Scotland. It would be useful for the morale of all concerned if there were a level playing field. The Government should reconsider the question of the transfer of all staff during the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss an issue that has been mentioned, but which the Minister did not adequately explain. In a press release dated 20 July, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Office Minister of State with responsibility for home affairs, stated that all new councils will be police authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not got the best brain in the world, but am trying to clarify the point. Can the Minister clear the matter up? Will the 30 councils be police authorities? There may be more councils, but that depends on the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and whether he gets his way at the Scottish Office. If so, fundamental questions must be asked about who will guide
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1136</span>
joint boards, who will fund them and in what proportions they will be funded. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East raised those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to believe that the reorganisation will mean that areas with high rates of crime, caused by a variety of factors, will pay the biggest bill? There has been a collective response throughout the regions of Scotland which makes sense. I cannot believe that the financial structure of the new boards will be fragmented by the amount paid to them being dependent on certain activity and crime in their area. If so, the reorganisation is a remarkable development, which illustrates again how muddled and foolish the operation is likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate revolves around what a police authority is. Is it a joint board in Strathclyde or is it an authority? There will be 12 or possibly 14 authorities if Lanarkshire is hacked up. The matter should be clarified because shock waves will be sent through the police service and the elected councils if a mess is made of deciding who pays for the service, especially in our major cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to associate my remarks with those the Minister made about Strathclyde. I do not know why it is being abolished. We have sat through endless debates and always end up in the same spot. There are calls for joint committees for social work in Strathclyde, joint committees for education, joint boards for the fire and police services and for children's panels, and joint boards for planning. Does not that illustrate the absurdity of the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sack the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be a popular piece; my hon. Friend was breaking into song.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pick my words carefully: the exercise is simply stupid, the Minister had lauded Strathclyde in a manner that I have never known any Tory Minister to adopt. Why does not he take a small step and tell his fellow Ministers at the Scottish Office that, even at this 11th hour, this crazy reorganisation should be thrown into the waste paper bin, which is a fit and proper place for it to end up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Minister's reluctant generosity in giving capital consent so that my councillor colleagues, the communities in Fife and I will have a new police headquarters. As that may be built in my constituency, I suspect that I might have special reason for being grateful to the Minister. I am not special pleading for specific areas from the Front Bench, but I hope that the Minister will reconsider the request for uniformed personnel, who are vital to the communities that I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will clear up the question of what is a police authority and who pays. Will he assure us that the transfer of all staff will be included in the Bill, so that mood and morale can be maintained and the momentum that has reduced crime figures in Strathclyde can continue? If that is done, the debate has been well worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's final question is yes. The existing Scottish police forces will remain after local government reform. All new councils will be police authorities. Most powers will be delegated to joint boards.

That is not new; it is the position in Lothian, the Borders, the Highlands and the Islands councils and it works well. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members say that it is a pity that I should intervene, but it is now clear that there is to be one joint board for Strathclyde, based on its existing authority boundaries, 12 police authorities and joint funding arrangements. Will the levels of police activity in a police authority determine the contribution to the overall budget of, in this case, Strathclyde?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funding of the new joint committees will be along the lines of that of the existing joint committees. Costs will be allocated among council areas as they are in each area—broadly in proportion to the number of police officers and other staff. That arrangement works well in Lothian and the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about the figure of 49 per cent. That figure can be variable and can be determined by the police authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister giving way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have sat down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has still not clarified the position. He said that costs will be allocated in proportion to the numbers of police in particular areas. I am worried that the ability to deploy police in those areas will remain the sole preserve of the chief constable in Tayside. He or she will be able to determine where the policing needs are and so where the police should be located. The costs of funding will be met by the joint board as a whole and will not be met in proportion to the population in each of the three constituent council areas. If Angus insists that it pays only 31 per cent. and Perth and Kinross insists that it pays only 32 per cent. of their share of the budget, the spiralling costs of policing in Dundee will have to be met by Dundee council, which will have to make its council tax payers pay significandy more man do those in surrounding areas. Is that what the Minister is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that costs will be apportioned among me constituent councils according to the actual costs of policing within their areas. Councils will be able to exercise some discretion for councils over expenditure and service levels in their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on two points about the allocation of staff and the costs of paying for them. Ibrox football stadium is in my constituency. The policing of Ibrox, and of Celtic park and other grounds in Glasgow, will presumably entirely fall on the population of Glasgow. Is that what the Minister is saying? There is a problem with football hooligans coming into Glasgow from Eastwood and similar nearby areas. It is unreasonable that the taxpayers of Glasgow should have to pay for the hooligans of Eastwood to be policed. Therefore, surely it is more appropriate for the entire costs of policing Strathclyde to be met equally by taxpayers in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another exactly related point. The report of the chief constable of Strathclyde mentions, in relation to G division, that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1138</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Known criminals were also targeted, as one prolific and determined thief can often account for a large number of car related crimes."</p></blockquote>
The example can apply elsewhere. Suppose that the crimes occur in one area but that the criminal who is targeted is in another area. Exactly which division is to be charged for that? Is it the area in which the criminal lives or the area in which the crimes are committed? Are we witnessing the development of an internal market in policing, where individual acts will be charged to individual authorities as and when they occur? The Minister seems to be making extremely heavy weather of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the hon. Gentleman extremely briefly. The key point is that it is up to the constituent authorities to agree the apportionment of costs. The Government will not impose a solution unless there is no agreement, but we envisage that there will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening again. The Minister has cited the Lothian and Borders police board as an object of great beauty. Much dissatisfaction has been expressed over the years, primarily in the Borders; the feeling is that too much is being paid, with not enough coming out of the pot. matters will get worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been doing some quick mental arithmetic. The new Lothian and Borders police area will include the city of Edinburgh with a population of 440,000 and the other three local authorities—the Borders, East Lothian, and West Lothian and Midlothian—with a combined population of 416,000. Therefore, there will be an overall majority on the new board from the City of Edinburgh authority, which will be able to determine all the details of policing policy for the Borders, East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian, as well as for Edinburgh. Surely the Minister must recognise that there will be even more conflict under the new arrangement, with the joint board of Lothian and the Borders, than there has been in the past. Will the Minister face up to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by what the Minister said. To my mind, far from clarifying matters, he has confused them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked a perfectly fair question about how the joint board system will be financed. First, the Minister said that finance would be in proportion to police officers and staff—thus ignoring actual crime levels and activity. He then said that it would be in proportion to expenditure, in response to the hon. Member for Dundee, East. If each local authority is the police authority and will receive cash in proportion to its activities, why have joint boards? Why are they necessary? The Minister has not given a clear explanation. The points raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East highlight serious issues that the Minister simply has not tackled. I repeat, why have joint boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be absolutely clear and say who pays for policing Ibrox, Celtic park and the other football grounds? Is it the council taxpayers of the whole of Strathclyde or of Glasgow only?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is repeating his case. Moreover, the matters that he raises are outwith the scope of the amendment. They are perfectly legitimate points, but they are outwith the scope of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1139</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in difficulty. The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and all existing uniformed and non-uniformed staff shall be retained by the forces".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there is a question of allocation. The main issue is for how long they are retained. It is similar to me issue of school catchment areas. The Minister guaranteed that they would be retained for day one, as it were, but not thereafter—suppose that the authorities cannot then afford to pay for them. That is the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment is about retaining staff. It does not deal with costs, but the hon. Member is raising that issue. Other hon. Members have spoken about joint boards. They, too, are not within the scope of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not apologise for speaking again because a new issue has been raised in relation to staffing, which will form the main cost. The cost distribution in the new structure is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell me whether I am right in thinking that the definition of a police authority does not appear in the Bill? Has that element of confusion been highlighted this morning because of the delivery of the press release from Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, which in July said that there would be 28 police authorities? If the answer is that those issues have not emerged before, should not the Committee hear a statement about the future of Scottish policing? The proposals are a shambles. We shall end up with eight boards and 30 police authorities, which will have to make a precept in their council tax and distribute cash for staffing in the way that my hon. Friends have described. If he does not want to create further problems in Scotland, the Minister should now tell us where police authorities are mentioned in me Bill and when the definition of them was arrived at. If he cannot do that now, will he make a statement this afternoon to clear up this appalling mess?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my last contribution this morning. On page 159 of the Bill, paragraph 67(3) of schedule 13 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 2(1) (police authorities and their functions), for the words from the beginning to 'police authority' substitute "For every police area the council constituted under section 2 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 shall be the police authority."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the issue is properly covered in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have kept quiet in the debate and anyone who has listened to it will know that mere is much justice in the request of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are not matters covered by the amendment. I am bound by the Standing Orders of the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are entirely consequential on the decisions about unitary councils made during consideration of schedule 1 that there should be one new unitary council for East and Midlothian and one for West Lothian and that a new council based on the boundaries of Inverclyde district council should be formed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not spoken for a long time, but I have been listening carefully to the debate and to the courteous answers—at least from the Minister, the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point that I want to make relates to Berwickshire and East and Midlothian, West Lothian, Inverclyde and the new authorities. The more we consider the Bill—as we are now doing in relation to police—the more chaotic the system becomes. We are shifting from a system that is reasonably understandable to one that is totally chaotic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to university with the Minister and through the council and Edinburgh corporation with him. I recognise that he is a gentleman and an intelligent one. I find it astonishing that with his ability, knowledge and understanding he is willing to be party to such a chaotic break up of Scottish local government. I am surprised that with his intellectual background he is willing to be party to something so intellectually flawed, stupid and outrageous. I hope, for my own satisfaction, that the Minister with responsibility for education and housing will intimate in some way that he realises that what the Government are up to is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has to do with the break up of the larger authorities.
