	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister will know and as col. 883 of 	<i>Hansard</i> shows, at about 1 am last Friday I raised two matters. The first related to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the RICS, and its concern about assessors and joint boards. The second was a brief, that, frankly, has been prepared for me by John Cardwell, the Lothian assessor. At the weekend, I spoke to Mr. Cardwell. I understand that he was in touch with Scottish Office officials yesterday and that a short statement may be made in response to the brief that I put forward on Friday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that I shall respond. During that extremely long debate, I recall that you, Sir James, had to call Opposition Members to order 25 times on one amendment. I do not know whether that is a record for you, Sir James, but it is certainly a record for me, given the many Committees on which I have served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of that extremely long debate on the difference between practicable and reasonably practicable, I noticed that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) fled the field, with head bowed—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman; he is entitled to do so. Given the amount of information that we were offered on various subjects—from flute bands to I do not know what—when we were just debating a small technical Opposition amendment, I am not surprised that he went elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us about the shambles of the Tory strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), does not appear to be in a very good mood this morning, even though, as usual, he is wearing one of his excellent and photogenic ties. I hope that he will cheer up as we proceed. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am in an extremely good mood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good. The Minister will therefore accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no amendments to this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important clause and no doubt according to the precedent—although it may not be followed—of what happened late on Thursday night, we shall be discussing the clause today and probably next Tuesday, too. But, perhaps matters will speed up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the debate on Thursday, the hon. Member for Linlithgow raised several questions relating to clauses 26 and 27. In my introductory remarks to clause 27—I may need to respond later at length, depending on what hon. Members say—I shall endeavour to answer those legitimate questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, perhaps I may set out the purpose of the clause. Valuation matters are important; perhaps that is common ground between members of the Committee. They are also fairly technical matters and it is no criticism of hon. Members if they do not always have at their fingertips all the details of how a valuation system works in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides for the establishment of each new authority as the valuation authority for its own area and for the transfer of existing valuation arrangements to the new authorities. The Secretary of State is empowered, by order, to specify the combination of areas for which a single assessor should be appointed and how those joint arrangements will work. That will avoid the need to increase the number of assessors from its present level of 10. Each valuation authority, or combination of valuation authorities, will be required to appoint an assessor as well as the number of depute assessors it considers necessary, to take office from 1 April 1996. Any assessor or depute assessor appointed by predecessor authorities will cease to hold office on that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to note that the hon. Member for Fife, Central is otherwise engaged, but I am glad to see that my hon. Friends are all listening to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many extra assessors are likely to be appointed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that the answer is simple—none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to realise that, in many ways, the clause establishes and maintains a continuity of arrangements that work well and have done so for some decades. The Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956 introduced the lands valuation service as it is currently understood. Following the Sorn report, service with a high degree of professionalism—I am sure that hon. Members from all parties in the Committee accept that—was introduced, based on the substantial geographical responsibilities for each county assessor. At the previous reform of local government in 1975, that was taken a stage further when the assessors and their staff were organised on a regional basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important point and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Hamilton has adopted his usual procedure of waiting for about five minutes in the Committee Room and then departing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slur. Withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not acknowledge that clause 27 on the establishment of regional assessors is a very important one, particularly for the future when we are bound to have many disputes over valuations and valuation bands? Therefore, it is important that the Committee understands fully and completely what the clause means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The valuation system is extremely important. It is important to individuals, their families and non-domestic ratepayers that the system works effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of interest, before the clause was introduced was any thought or research undertaken to consider the English valuation system and whether elements of that could be translated into the Scottish system? I hasten to add that I am not advocating that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We considered what happens in England and Wales where the system is organised on a different basis with the involvement of the Inland Revenue. On the issue of rating practices, which is not quite what we are discussing, we looked carefully over a period of time at the differences in rating practices and in valuation procedures north and south of the border. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will be aware of that and he has written to me about some of the anomalies that have arisen and created difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the organisation of the system, we naturally consider what happens in the rest of the United Kingdom, but we shall remain with the present system in Scotland, which is organised on a regional basis with the islands areas being combined with each other in the case of the northern isles, and with Highland region in the case of the Western Isles. That means that we have 10 assessors responsible for their service throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow at the end of the previous sitting. He specifically asked that I should confirm that assessors would remain responsible for lands valuation and for rating and council tax purposes in Scotland. I am happy to give him that confirmation. The Bill makes the assessors' continuing responsibilities emphatically clear and we do not intend to change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also aked me to clarify our intentions regarding the prescription of qualifications for assessors. I refer hon. Members to clause 27(3) which makes clear that the Secretary of State must
	<br><blockquote><p>"prescribe the qualifications required to be possessed"</p></blockquote>
by an assessor or depute assessor. That rolls forward an existing arrangement and I hope that it will be acceptable to the Committee. We have no current intention of varying the present qualifications, which have served well the system since 1956. They consist of the appropriate level of membership of RICS, which, as the hon. Member for Linlithgow told us, has made representations to the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of broadening the range of professional qualifications appropriate to the assessor's post was reviewed in the 1980s and at that time we did not consider any change to be appropriate. We see no reason to revisit that issue at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>890</span>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow also sought confirmation that we intended to use the powers in clause 27 to combine valuation authorities, through the mechanism of a joint board, for the purpose of appointing a single assessor in such a way as to retain the present number of assessors. That directly relates to the question that the hon. Gentleman asked a few moments ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention to use those powers to achieve groupings of authorities for the purpose of appointing assessors which will bring about the benefits that existing arrangements have given. Broadly speaking, we intend that there should not be a change in the present number of assessors—there should be 10 throughout the country. However, on considering groupings and boundaries, if there were a strong case for some slight variation, I should not feel bound to oppose that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combination of areas is a related, but separate question. One obvious possibility is that combinations should be made which would, in effect, allow the present regional assessors' departments to continue as if no reform were taking place. That is not the only option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To gauge the pros and cons of different approaches, I propose to initiate as soon as practicable a broad consultation with the bodies and interests most obviously involved to determine which approach will prove most efficient and command support. We want to hear what bodies, such as the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and RICS have to say on the matter before bringing forward particular proposals. I assure the hon. Member for Linlithgow that we do not have preconceived views about which combinations of areas will prove best, but nor is any option automatically ruled out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Linlithgow asked whether it was intended that, as now, the assessors should also act as electoral registration officers. That was the subject of an amendment to the clause which was subsequently withdrawn. That amendment would have had the effect of vesting statutorily in the assessors of the new authorities responsibility for electoral registration. That is an important point for the ordinary elector and for us when we stand in front of the electorate at elections. I shall spell out the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not consider that statutory vesting would have been either necessary or desirable. The current position is that assessors have traditionally and for good reasons carried out the task in Scotland. I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that it has been well done, but that is no argument for removing the flexibility which the present statutory provisions allow. The Representation of the People Act 1983 provides that it is a matter for each local authority to decide who should carry out the electoral registration function, which is so important to our democracy. We would not want to prescribe the local authorities' power of decision in such away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of flexibility held by Scottish local authorities has created no problems and I do not think that the Committee would want to take such an important power away by statutory prescription. It would also be technically unsatisfactory to give local authorities a general power under section 8(3) of the 1983 Act and then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>891</span>
take it away by means of the specific duty prescribed by the amendment. Thus, while we would in practice anticipate that the new authorities would want to continue with the long-standing practice of vesting the electoral registration function in the assessors, we do not consider that there is a case for tightening the statutory flexibility that is currently available to authorities, nor has any such case been put to us by the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is important and deserves attention. The questions of the hon. Member for Linlithgow have, I hope, enabled me to make a number of matters clear and to help the Committee. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss the clause. Of all the changes that are taking place in local government, the electors must realise that the critical issue for their future is the bands in which their properties are and the local taxes that will be raised. The system of arriving at the bands and making allocations to them are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Linlithgow that Members of Parliament do not usually come off well if they tackle regional assessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience tells us that assessors are highly qualified individuals. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister drew attention to the fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State lays down the necessary requirements and qualifications. The public would want to have confidence in those who decide which band their property is in and the valuation of their land. As I represent a large rural authority, I was interested to hear my hon. Friend mention land valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the passage of time and the changes that are taking place not just in local government but in the community at large all those issues will have an impact. I wonder what impact the changes in the common agricultural policy on set-aside, for example, will have on land valuations in a constituency like mine. Land prices are bound to change. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consequently those changes will raise questions and possibly disputes. That is where the regional assessor comes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that we are now looking at how we set up the organisation with the regional assessors and their deputes in such a way that will inspire confidence and offer flexibility. In an earlier debate it was also suggested that people who represent given areas, a region, for example, may not have the same kind of loyalties to districts. I think it was the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) who suggested that that might be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed that we have roughly 10 combination authorities. The arrangement will be flexible and will depend on discussions. I hope that the assessors will behave as independently as I have always found them to behave. They have not shown loyalty to any particular region, district or indeed council of whatever political colour. In my time in Parliament I have found assessors to be very independent souls. Long may that continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I found most interesting in my hon. Friend the Minister's speech was the assessors' position as
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
electoral registration officers. I am glad that a certain amendment has been withdrawn because I was concerned that an attempt would be made to write into statute that that rule would be a mandatory requirement. The fact that it is done that way and works is not a reason to bring about changes in statute. I am a great believer in keeping flexibility where it exists. As it is the responsibility of the new authorities, they will have the flexibility to choose who carries out the function of electoral registration officer. The Government have been wise to retain that flexibility. One of the reasons why the amendment was withdrawn is that the Opposition realised that there would have been objections from the local authorities. When the new statutes appear those authorities want to retain the degree of flexibility that they have traditionally enjoyed. I congratulate my hon. Friend on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also interested in what happens if one has to try to remove an assessor from office, because it is important. Sadly, individuals can transgress in their jobs and there may be moves to remove them. Quite properly anyone who is in such an independent position should be protected by built-in safeguards that would allow him to continue to follow a policy of flexibility that will ensure that he need not always look over his shoulder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to see that under subsection (6)(a) not less than two thirds of those present at a meeting of the valuation authority must pass a resolution to remove an assessor or depute assessor. That is an important safeguard, because we all know that to get two thirds is always difficult. Clause 27(6)(b) requires the Secretary of State's consent, but more importantly, the Secretary of State will have the authority to ensure that the assessor will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
All those provisions are required to enable the assessors to carry out their vital part of the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully expected that a clause of such length and importance, with so many subsections, would have elicited many speeches from the Committee. We are establishing appointments in law, as well as the areas that will be covered, the qualifications required and the methods of removal of assessors who are found wanting. We shall also be considering the establishment of the constitution and proceedings of the joint boards that will supervise the assessors' responsibilities. I am amazed that more hon. Members are not going to contribute to this important debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee's mood seems to be that we should not consider the important aspects of the Bill that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, any charges on people produce a reaction. I shall go further and say that in my experience of politics there are two ways of motivating people—putting money in their pockets or taking it out. The effect of a regional assessor allocating a band will generally be to take something from someone's pocket. That will almost certainly motivate the person concerned. I expect to receive—as I do now—correspondence from people who have been and still are upset because they consider the banding that they have been given to be unrealistic. It has taken a long time to reach decisions on appeals against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>893</span>
banding. Many cases are still pending. That demonstrates the importance to our constituents of the assessors' jobs and powers, and the mechanisms for removing them from their posts. I am astonished that more hon. Members do not intend to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief contribution to the debate. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and my hon. Friend the Minister that the clause is important. I, too, am surprised that there is no movement from Opposition Members to contribute to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a good opportunity to pay tribute to the present regional assessors. In the time that I have dealt with the relevant department I have found the approach, certainly of the Grampian region assessors, to be always professional and sound. I pay tribute to David Henry and his team in Aberdeen for carrying out a difficult task with a high degree of professionalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North mentioned, the format of local taxation has undergone a change. Clause 27 is therefore important. The regional assessor's task is to set the basis on which local taxation is levied. He has the unenviable task of standing back and applying the ground rules to set up the system on which local government can raise taxes. Inevitably that task, with the changes that have taken place, has created a heavy work load in the past year for regional assessors' departments. I know that they have a full programme of work in the year to come. We should pay tribute to the organised way in which they have tackled the difficulties that they face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's provision for the new local authorities to get together and create joint boards for valuation and assessment purposes. There is, inevitably, debate throughout our proceedings about the cost of the reorganisation. I am well aware that this is a key area in which we could have been caught in the trap of placing on each new local authority the obligation of having its own exclusive assessors' department. That would have increased costs significantly. I wonder whether COSLA, in its deliberations on costs, has really taken that into account. If an assessors' department is to retain a high level of professional expertise, it must be a meaningful unit that can attract the best professional people. Therefore, we should not increase the number of assessors throughout the country. I welcome the reassurance that my hon. Friend the Minister gave on that point.

My hon. Friend referred to consultations. There will inevitably be much debate between new local authorities on how they get together to provide the service. As there will be significantly more new local authorities than there are regional councils, their groupings will reflect a natural coming together on assessment. Equally, there will be an opportunity to assess those groupings. If a region was responsible for assessing and valuing an area whose inclusion in the region was not obvious, this will be an opportunity to reassess such matters and suggest a new configuration. I believe that assessors' departments will be willing to participate in such an exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers a typical point in the Bill. The Government have sought to give the new local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
the maximum flexibility. We shall debate education shortly and there will be much discussion about what should be statutory and what local authorities should organise themselves. I welcome the fact that the clause gives local authorities the maximum flexibility to provide the best possible service, using the best possible people. Without that flexibility, there would be a natural increase in costs.

I heartily support everything that my hon. Friend the Minister has said about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, perhaps, appropriate that you inadvertently called me "Bill Gallie", Sir James, because the work of the assessor in a local authority ends up in the bills that are put through constituents' letter boxes. Those bills are an emotive subject: they can be substantial, and they play a major part in people's daily financial affairs.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will put on the record that the hon. Member for Linlithgow has taken part in the debate, and that he raised a number of important and pertinent questions. Therefore, my hon. Friend's criticism—if he is making any—could not reasonably apply to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Member for Linlithgow is one Opposition Member who recognises the importance of the clause. I also recall that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a contribution, so I shall not apply my comments to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, my hon. Friend the Minister referred to the absence of the hon. Member for Hamilton from Thursday evening's debate. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East suggested, Thursday evening was really Friday morning However, I will not pursue that point because you, Sir James, have often had to pull hon. Members up on it. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) also did a runner on Thursday night. I wonder whether he had some insight into what his hon. Friends were going to talk about, and so took the easy way out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as we can tell, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is still running.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend may have an insight about that. Perhaps, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is lurking in the Corridor, talking to someone who is looking to make considerable changes to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the appointment of assessors, my constituency mail-bag is still being swelled by complaints from people who are unhappy with the bandings that they were given when the council tax was introduced. The bandings are entirely within the gift of the assessor, so that person has a tremendous influence on the lives of individual constituents. Therefore, it is right that the expertise and knowledge of those who set those bands is of the highest level possible. I welcome the clause because it refers to the Secretary of State's right to prescribe qualifications for such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also take note that my hon. Friend the Minister suggested that the number of assessors in Scotland will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>
not be more than 10 unless a specific requirement is made, which will presumably be argued in detail by the authorities. I am interested in that point and I ask my hon. Friend to expand on it when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also makes specific reference to the qualifications and remuneration of assessors. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us whether the terms and conditions for existing assessors will be carried over once the Bill is implemented? Every assessor in Scotland will have an interest in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On bandings, non-domestic rating and the valuations on business property are also important issues. There is nothing more important to the business sector in Scotland than the current level of non-domestic rating valuations. In recent years, the Government have driven towards a unified business rate. Right at the centre of such a policy must be the actions of an assessor. Given the terms of the clause, will its provisions and the criteria for the appointment of assessors be such that they allow for a continued drive towards a unified business rate? We have to ask about the relationship between valuations now set in Scotland by the assessors and those being set in England and Wales. If we drive towards the unified business rate, those issues are important. The assessors will have a great weight on their shoulders in ensuring that Scotland gets a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The pause in the hon. Gentleman's speech was by far the best of it so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just reflecting to ensure that I did not miss any of the points that I want to make. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that I am in the wrong for pausing for thought, perhaps he would care to get to his feet to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to subsection (6)(a). It deals with the dismissal of an assessor, be it through a unitary authority or through a joint board. It calls for two thirds of the members of a board or an authority to determine the reasons for dismissal. No member of the Committee would challenge the importance of the independence of an assessor, so the provision has considerable import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two thirds majority does not necessarily mean that a resolution to dismiss would prevent political malice from being exerted against an assessor. If the current Strathclyde scenario is examined, a committee of that council could compromise more than two thirds of the dominant political party. Does my hon. Friend the Minister think that two thirds is sufficient to achieve the aims that he and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have set out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the Secretary of State will have an imput, because his consent to such a dimissal is sought. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North suggested, the Secretary of State will be obliged to appoint an independent individual to meet the authority and the assessor to establish the rights and wrongs of a request to sever an assessor's appointment. The clause therefore contains an element of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursday evening, the debate centred on whether the number of assessors in Scotland would be increased significantly by the enactment of the Bill. The hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
Member for Dundee, East paid considerable attention to the matter during the illuminating debate about whether the word "reasonably" should be inserted before the word "practicable". You, Sir James, had to intervene several times because there was so much repetition in the debate. I shall endeavour to ensure that that does not occur today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend the Minister think that the new structure of local authorities will mean that the same number of assessors and depute assessors, given current circumstances, would be required? Under the old domestic rating arrangements, valuation assessments were based on potential rentals. That has been changed and we now face close knit capital valuations. Will that lessen the requirement for assessor involvement and, over time, will local authorities have the potential to reduce input into assessor activities? That will doubtless be the task of individual authorities and of the joint boards, when local authorities join other bodies to determine such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I welcome the fact that Opposition Members saw fit not to go ahead with the amendments that they intended to table. I recognise the wisdom of that. I trust that they will reassess many other amendments on their lengthy list as, in some instances, they are unnecessary and would be ineffective. I welcome also COSLA's comments on the matter, as I shall when we discuss clause 31.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their well-deserved tribute to the Scottish assessors. In his excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) referred to the number of changes to the local government finance system in recent years. It would be out of order for me to debate the merits of the changes from the old domestic rating system to the community charge and then to the council tax system, but my hon. Friend is right to say that the number of changes has created a considerable burden of work for the assessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) asked about the progress toward the unified business rate, which is of great interest to the assessors and to Scottish business. We have made progress—of about £440 million—toward closing that gap, which I hope will be closed in the near future. That relates to the 1995 valuation, which is also the answer to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North about possible changes in the valuation of agricultural properties because of changes in the common agricultural policy. Any changes will be fully taken into account in the 1995 valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends were right to point to the importance of assessors' qualifications and I confirm what I said earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend explain a little more about the assessors' duties in ensuring that they are on the same valuation platform as the assessors or whoever sets valuations in England, so that Scotland can be sure to have a fair deal on non-domestic rating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. I pay tribute to the assessors in Scotland for their work, in consultation with the Inland Revenue, which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>
responsible for those matters south of the border. Some changes have had to be made by statute because the assessors must conform to the statute law that is before them. Some small changes are contained in the Bill, which we shall reach later and a number of other changes have been put through in other legislation. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr about the importance of ensuring that at and after the 1995 revaluations those differences, some of very long standing, are resolved so that there is equal and fair treatment north and south of the border. It does not always work one way: it can work in different directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the work load of assessors. He must be aware that tens of thousands of Scots have been waiting for almost a year for their appeals against council tax bandings to be processed. Can he tell us when he, as the Minister responsible for local government finance, expects all those outstanding appeals to be processed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an issue that is of considerable interest to a large number of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the Minister is responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not responsible for deciding on appeals on valuation. The assessors are responsible for that. We are watching progress but I cannot give a date by which all the revaluation decisions on appeal will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bandings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry, banding appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why under clause 27(11) are orders to be made by the negative rather than the affirmative procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has put that to me before in a number of contexts. There could, of course, be quite a number of orders under the clause. The precedent here is to have such matters considered by negative resolution. It is worth emphasising, although the hon. Member will doubtless be able to advance counter arguments, that where a significant number of hon. Members wish to ensure debates on statutory instruments that are subject to negative resolution, they can do so under the procedures of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the importance of the remarks by my hon. Friends about the independence of assessors and their statutory responsibility. The two issues are closely linked. My hon. Friends were right to point to the importance of subsection (6) concerning any effort to remove an assessor from office or a requirement that he resign as an alternative. That is an important additional safeguard. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr asked what happens if the number of elected members of a particular party on an authority exceeds the two thirds limit. That is certainly a possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not technically possible to combine that with the provisions of clause 31 and to have the prospect of an education committee subsuming the role
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
of valuation? What would that do to the independence of the electoral registration officer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the safeguards under clause 27(6) refer to the members of the authority, no such decision could be taken by two thirds of the group of members of the authority. It would be the authority as a whole. Secondly, there is the safeguard of the Secretary of State's consent to which my hon. Friends have rightly referred. It is clear that there is a considerable package of safeguards to ensure the independence of the assessors which hon. Members rightly and properly value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends asked about consultation on groupings of authorities. I assure them that such consultation will begin as soon as possible and that there is flexibility in the system. I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their view on maintaining the present flexibility in relation to electoral registration officers. I hope that my comments have been helpful. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a particularly important debate because education is the largest single service that the new authorities will manage. It is regrettable that the subject is given only two clauses in a Bill of about 220 pages. A substantial number of serious issues need to be explored. It is regrettable that the Government did not adequately explain many of them in the run up to the publication of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly clear that the Government are adopting the Denis Norden approach to education; they are assuming that "It'll Be Alright on the Night" and that things will magically work out. That assumption amounts to cavalier treatment of staff and parents. It neither gives the children the justice that they deserve nor adequately recognises the commitment of many of the people in the education service. It is a reprehensible way of dealing with education and a clear indication that the Government are not interested in local government as a provider of services. They have drawn up a local government system based simply on boundaries and then observed the resulting service implications, rather than doing things the other way about, as happened with the previous reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has tried to show that he is a listening Minister and that he wants to avoid the confrontations of his predecessor and work with people rather than against them. I hope that in those circumstances he will be prepared to listen to the views of the vast majority of people involved in Scottish education. I am in no doubt that the amendments command the support of virtually everyone involved in Scottish education. There is no doubt that the churches, parents' and teaching organisations, the head teachers' groups—everyone involved in Scottish education—support the case advanced by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those involved in Scottish education are clear about what they want. They want education directors and education committees. The onus lies with the Minister to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>901</span>
explain what strong case the Government have for turning against the majority view in Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I will do so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view the education service will suffer considerable detriment if the proposals are implemented as they have been presented by the Government. The education service will be substantially disrupted and dislocated, particularly as it is now under great pressure. The Minister will be well aware of all the arguments about the pressures in the system. I hardly need to run through the range of innovations that are being introduced at a time of under-resourcing. Only last week Son of Howie, as it were, was introduced, with a time scale that has staggering implications for reorganisation requirements. Yet the proposals for the reorganisation of the service do not recognise those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also clear that the reorganisation will result in budget cuts in education. The Government have made it clear that no money will be made available beyond the sums that they have already named. But the assumptions and proposals of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and others make it clear that the Government allocation will not meet the costs of reorganisation. Therefore there will be cuts in the education service, as in other services, at a time of dislocation. When we should be spending more, cuts will be made in teaching and other staff. Maintenance will be cut and there will be school closures for financial reasons. We shall consider that matter later. Money for materials to be used by staff and pupils will be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A structure will be created in which many education authorities will be too small to provide the full range of facilities and functions that are necessary parts of education. I recognise that the Government have accepted that point, but they assume that things will work out all right on the night and that there will be a magical coming together, although they do not spell out how that will happen or whether there will be more money to make it happen. All the records show, as in the case of the abolition of the inner London education authority, that such reorganisation methods—the atomisation of the service—do not result in co-operation across boundaries such as the Minister, in his more wishful moments, might imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that small authorities, such as that proposed for East Renfrewshire, among others, will require joint arrangements for special education needs, psychological services, career services, teacher resource centres, teacher support services, outdoor education provision, residential provision for people with severe behavioural problems, pre-fives services, community education, the inspectorate and advisory services. If all those services require to be provided by a joint board system or through co-operation between authorities, there will either be a complete organisational muddle, which will be time consuming and expensive, or, effectively, a two-tier system of education. That is in no one's interests. The Government must explain why they believe that the costs and difficulties caused by this dislocation are justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also worried that the social strategy elements that have been adopted by many education authorities,
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
and which are an important part of provision, will be severely damaged by these proposals. Not only will some authorities be too small to have any meaningful social strategy—any concept of priority—but, as I said earlier, the amount of money available will be greatly diminished. In those circumstances, the basic needs will inevitably take priority. That is likely to result in the abandonment of the positive discrimination strategies that many authorities have adopted. The Minister must give a clear undertaking that he intends to ensure that sufficient money is made available to those areas that contain areas of priority treatment and other areas of deprivation so that there is no detriment as a result of the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that we shall see cuts at the margins of education—the things that might appear marginal to the main core functions but are, none the less, a vital part of the education service. I refer to bursaries, degrees of funding for footwear and clothing, school meals, any discretion regarding transport—we shall come back to that on Thursday—pre-fives provision and staffing enhancements. Those are all areas in which a local authority that is hard pressed for cash might find itself obliged to cut in programmes designed particularly to benefit those who need help most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should spell out how those services will be maintained after reorganisation. Or does he think that my points have no validity? If he believes that nothing detrimental will occur he must explain how the four problems that I have mentioned will be overcome. He has not done so to date. There has been very little word from the Scottish Office and the Minister on how these difficulties created for the education service will be dealt with. Before the end of the debate, he must explain to us how he intends to deal with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see how an increase from nine to 27 education authorities can be explained as a move towards efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of 27 education directorates, rather than nine, seems the very antithesis of a move towards efficiency. It does not seem the most efficient way of doing things. The Government's answer was on the lips of the other Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who said that we will not have any directors or education committees at all. Hey presto, with one bound Jack is free. There is no difficulty about saying that they are moving from nine to 27; in fact, they are moving from nine to nothing at all. That does not seem the most appropriate way of dealing with an education service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of major arguments as to why we should have provision for the education committees and education directors. [HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Gentleman should give way."] I see no reason why I should allow myself to be interrupted. I am quite happy to take points later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to have an education committee so that we may continue to have a degree of strategic planning—an

	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
overview—of the education service, which will still remain one of the major spenders in local government. It is essential that we have a system and a structure that allows a degree of accountability for the work that is being undertaken, which is not then muddled up by being lumped in with another service. There is no doubt that if one does not have professional staff support at the pinnacle of any service, the professional quality and commitment of that service is likely to be downgraded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members and parents in Scotland want a guarantee that the education service will continue to be run and dominated by a professional ethos, by professional managers, by people who have experience and knowledge in education and not simply by accountants. That is an important issue given what was said earlier about the impact that the reorganisation will have on the financial basis of the local authority structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many hon. Members wish to take part in the debate. There are a number of other points that I want to make about education committees and education directors, but I want the Minister to tell us the arguments for his belief that the abolition of both committees and directors is justified. The decision that will be taken today means that local authorities will not be obliged to have an education committee or an education director. It is clearly an abdication of responsibility by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister how he intends to square the Government's position with what I expect to be that of Conservative candidates at the next regional elections. How many Conservative regional candidates will run for election and say that they are in favour of abolishing education directors and education committees in their area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. How many people will stand for election and say that, in their area, they will use the discretion the Government are about to give them to vote for the abolition of an education committee or an education director?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I seek your guidance because the hon. Gentleman has failed to give way on several occasions and yet he has patently not read this part of the Bill. He has referred to education committees being abolished when clearly that will not happen. Is the hon. Gentleman right to refuse continually to give way? Will he allow us to debate the amendment, which is what we are here to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members knowledge or lack of knowledge is not a matter for the Chair. The hon. Member speaking may or may not give way according to his wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Will you clarify whether an obligation not to have an education committee is the same as its abolition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to give way because, in the past, I have seen Conservative Members deliberately seek, on spurious points of order, to destroy arguments—[	<i>Interruption</i>]—by a constant process of interruption. Such exchanges and such school boy behaviour, which we often see in this Committee and in the House, do not do justice to the cause of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a moment and take part in a dialogue. I know that many of my hon. Friends want to speak, but I wanted to develop my main points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I give way to Conservative Members, I want to make it clear that everyone involved in education in Scotland wants the amendment to be supported. There is no doubt that Churches, local authorities that are education authorities, parents organisations and teaching unions all want to have education committees and education directors enshrined in the Bill. If the Minister believes that he is a listening Minister, he must explain clearly why he wants that guarantee and security taken out of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial arguments exist, which I have not developed, as to why that provision should be in the Bill. They relate to the merits of education committees and education directors. The Minister is making the change, so the onus must he on him to explain clearly why education committees and education directors have hampered the education service. The case for change has not been made. The onus and responsibility to make that change has to lie with the Minister. Once he explains why he wants to abolish the compulsion on authorities to have education committees, we can debate the pros and cons. If any member of the Committee wants to ask questions, I am open to queries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have difficulty in understanding the hon. Gentleman. I have read the Bill. Where is it specified that education committees or education directors should be abolished? Surely the local authorities are being given a choice about whether to have them. If the hon. Gentleman has an argument that they should not be abolished, it should be put to the new education authorities. Why should anyone dictate to a local authority how it should run its affairs? There should be greater local democracy concerning a local decision, which the hon. Gentleman proposes to deny local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit rich for an English Member of Parliament, in whose constituency the Government will insist that a chief education officer is provided, to tell us that that post should be abolished in Scotland, and that there should be no instruction that there should be education directors and education committees in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is it that the hon. Member can come here and say that what is good enough for him is not good enough for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
us? Tories in England have determined that there should be chief education officers in England and Wales, yet the hon. Member has the cheek to tell us that we should not have them. That is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was anxious and pained at the prospect of having 27 education authorities. What would he say to the leader of his party, the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith), who, at the previous reorganisation, wanted responsibility for education to be given to the districts, thereby calling for 52 education authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the merits of being in the Labour party is that we are free to disagree with our leader from time to time. I can clarify for the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. and learned Friend was not leader of the Labour party at that time and was, therefore, under no obligation to reflect Labour party policy. I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend agrees with what Labour Members have said today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman return to the point at issue? Several times during his speech, he has referred to the fact that the Bill abolishes directors of education and education committees. To assist me and my hon. Friends, will he tell us the line in the Bill which contains such a provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The status quo is that they exist and the Bill's proposals would remove them. We propose to reinstate them. We want education committees and directors of education to be mandatory in Scottish local authorities. That is in the best interest of our young people. There should be a professionally led service and committees which are responsible for managing it. If the Conservative party does not want that, it is out of touch with opinion in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clear up the doubts of Conservative Members and their distortions, will my hon. Friend comment on the notes on clauses supplied by the Scottish Office? Paragraph 3 a of the notes on clause 31 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there should no longer be a statutory requirement to have a specific education committee".</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend agree that the power to abolish education committees is being given to the authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members want to use the point as a diversion. The argument is about whether local authorities should be obliged to have education committees. Labour Members believe that they should, you believe that they should not. The case lies with yourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities should be obliged to have education committees. That is what the amendment would provide. You are making the change. The onus is on you to explain why you believe that that should be done. I look forward to hearing the Minister tell us that. That is what I want to respond to later in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the hon. Gentleman refers to "you" he refers to the Chair and the Chair has nothing to do with these allegations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to take up much of the Committee's time; many hon. Members wish to speak. I do not deny that I approach the debate from a completely different perspective from Opposition Members. I do not represent the vested interests of regional councillors who have self-interests at stake. I do not approach it from the angle of a former political boss of the education authority of Strathclyde region. I come to the debate as a former school teacher who delivered the service, as a former card-carrying member of the Educational Institute of Scotland and as a former employee of Strathclyde regional council's education department—probably the only one on the Committee. I am therefore concerned about the delivery of education in schools and the delivery of the education service at the chalk face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) seemed to imply that education has to be in the hands of a large education authority to ensure a smooth and effective delivery. Perhaps when he comes to wind up the debate he will tell us why one of the first things that Strathclyde region did was to turn the structure governing the provision of education into a divisional one. If a large education authority was necessary why is education delivered in Strathclyde, in Argyll, in Ayrshire, in Glasgow, in Renfrew, in Lanark and Dumbarton on a divisional basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that one of the divisions that delivered that education is an all-Ayrshire division?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what point the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. I am quite sure that the hon. Member for Govan, who was the chairman of the education committee, will confirm that those divisions were not some loose divisional structure but were very tight. To try to cross divisions in Strathclyde, whether as a member of staff trying to get a transfer or someone looking for cross-divisional co-operation was, in some cases, like trying to cross the Berlin wall. Those divisions were highly devolved and highly independent parts of the education service. That is why in my first job in Smithycroft in the east end of Glasgow when we looked at joint ventures and co-operation at a school level we looked to Pope John Paul II academy or John Street, not to Lochgilphead high in Argyll or Ardrossan high in Ayrshire. When I moved to Dumbarton we looked to the Hermitage in Helensburgh or the Vale of Leven never to Oban high and certainly never to Lanark grammar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no cross-divisional co-operation whatsoever. Why? Because the problems, the solutions, the challenges and the opportunities were different. Education is best delivered at a local level. In many of the areas that the hon. Gentleman talked about we undertook joint ventures in the curriculum with neighbouring schools in our locality. As time passed and Strathclyde region progressed, the divisions became self-standing with little co-operation between them. The argument that small cannot deliver is an odd one for the hon. Gentleman to advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I am also a former teacher. My understanding of the development of policy in Strathclyde
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
is that policy was not developed at divisional but at regional level. I am aware of what is still going on from my EIS colleagues; that policy works on a Strathclyde basis. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that there was no policy from above and no general transfer across the boundaries? Although he says that there is co-operation between schools within divisions, the policies were developed at a regional basis and each division fed into that regional policy process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As time passed the divisional structures became much more self-standing. That is undeniable. Yes, there was co-operation but there will still be co-operation under the new structure. That is what Opposition Members do not seem to realise. We are not saying that there will not be co-operation but that the management of education can be delivered effectively at a smaller more localised unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that small cannot deliver is odd. Two reports published in December last year by the audit unit of Her Majesty's inspectors of schools on Scottish school costs and leaver destinations from Scottish secondary schools revealed that some of the most efficient education authorities currently in Scotland are the smaller ones. Western Isles, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney and Fife regularly scored as the best performers in both of those reports whether on costs or in sending most pupils to higher and further education. At the end of the day that is what our schools are about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley report, which Opposition Members often quote, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some witnesses saw no objection to recommending the adoption for educational purposes of the same very broad areas that they felt to be right for planning. But 	<i>most</i> of the educational witnesses shrank from, this. They could not, for instance, readily envisage the whole of the Clyde Valley, with a population of over 2 million, as the area of a single education authority … Such a large area would offer no educational advantages: it would be administratively unwieldy; and it would raise the question whether, with one education authority covering almost half the population of Scotland, it was really worth while to have local education authorities at all."</p></blockquote>
That is from the Wheatley report, which Conservative Members often have rammed down their throats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan dismissed lightly what John Smith said, but it is worth considering that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should refer to hon. Members by their constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the previous reform of local government, the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let me tell the Government that local interest in education is understandably intense, probably more intense (than in Housing) and the education service should, in our view, be responsive to this interest. If, in order to get this responsiveness it was necessary to move housing from region to district, it is worth while taking education out of the hands of a very large authority and giving it to a smaller, authority."—	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1973; 	<i>c.</i>205.]</p></blockquote>
When the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman winds up, perhaps he will tell us what has changed since the previous reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about the size of authorities. Will he explain why the post of a statutory director of education is
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
appropriate for England, but has to be abolished in Scotland, rather than talk about the size of authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that if the hon. Gentleman will bear with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the idea of directors of education and statutory education committees. The hon. Member for Govan tried to imply that everybody involved in education in Scotland was in favour of his amendments. That is not the case. Independent Borders regional council, Labour-controlled Central regional council, independent Highland regional council, the Society of Directors of Administration, Labour-controlled Renfrew district council, Labour-controlled East Lothian district council and Labour-controlled East Kilbride district council do not want the amendments. The Labour Party Scottish Council commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The objective should be to create a system in which flexible, corporate working bodies exist within the councils, which work in the interest of the community rather than functioning primarily within the confines of their professional disciplines."</p></blockquote>
That is what we are trying to deliver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend received a letter, which I have received, from COSLA dated 4 March 1994? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is believed that fewer than 20 councils (out of 65) support the retention of these statutory provisions, though opinion amongst existing regional and islands councils is more evenly balanced on the matter."</p></blockquote>
It therefore appears that COSLA supports the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In responses to the Government's consultation process on internal management, 51 per cent. of those who commented on the existing statutory committees favoured a repeal of the current statutory requirement for an education committee, 68 per cent. of local authority responses favoured that approach and 52 per cent. were against the statutory post of director of education being maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that we consult, but do not listen. On this occasion, we have consulted and we are doing what the majority of those consulted want. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot lambast the Government for not listening and then, when the Government do listen and implement exactly the outcome of the consultation process, say that the Government must not do that because they do not agree with it. That is unparalleled arrogance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that among those who responded to the Government's consultation document on internal management, a clear majority with education experience were in favour of retaining the statutory requirement? Will he accept that there is no question of the argument being based on vested interests? Archbishop Thomas Winning of Glasgow and the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland are in favour of the statutory requirement and nobody could claim that they are arguing for the same vested interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite his words the hon. Gentleman cannot deny that the consultation process brought a clear majority, ranging from 51 per cent. to 68 per cent., in

	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
favour of the Bill's proposals. We are creating a flexible system which, given all the developments in Scottish education, particularly devolved management of schools, will not enshrine in legislation conditions with which authorities will not be able to cope in five or six years' time. A flexible system will vary from area to area depending on local needs, and will be able to adapt to the changes in Scottish education. It will serve Scotland well. I am a former teacher and member of the EIS and I have no hesitation in supporting my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is considering issues that should unite it in the interests of social work and education. A few red herrings have already been thrown into the debate, about management, the size of authorities and internal management documents. The real issues must be faced and I hope to deal with some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that it would be daft and dangerous if the Government removed the statutory requirement for education directors and committees and for social work directors and committees. It would destroy much of what has been built up in the past few decades in Scotland. It must be stressed again that we enjoy—even in Strathclyde, so much lambasted by the Government—some of the best services to be found anywhere in Europe. Scotland has pioneered development in social services and education. The big authorities, the big regions that have been greatly criticised, are at the forefront of those developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues cut deep. They concern the people whom we serve, whether as Members of Parliament or as councillors. The clauses and amendments he at the heart of the Bill's purpose. They affect the future shape of Scotland as a civilised community, in the remainder of the decade and the early years of the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the most compelling ideas for the 21st century, surely the ideas of learning for life, which is the preserve of education, and of dignity throughout life, which is the preserve of social work, should unite the Committee around what is best for the people whom we serve. The debate should not be distorted by issues such as the market place, small authorities or what Governments may want to do about those services. There is no compelling evidence to suggest that we should abandon something that is working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee decides this morning to abandon statutory provision or to leave it to the authorities to continue provision, we shall be sending the wrong message to all the organisations in Scotland that care about education, and to the people of Scotland. The message will be that we believe that in the 1990s and beyond 2000, arrangements should be left to the vagaries of individual authorities. That cannot be right, because we are dealing with vital services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman really mean what he has just said? If I hear him correctly, he has no faith in hardworking elected councillors throughout Scotland. Surely he accepts that they will ensure adequate education provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be at my most courteous and to suggest that I am not in a position to take lectures about
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
how I support elected councillors in Scotland. Labour Members are willing on any occasion to defend, applaud and congratulate local councillors for the work that they do. That is not what we are considering. In any democracy there is, in its legislature, a debate about balance. A balance must always be struck between what Government or Parliament should require in statute and the recognition of the rights and needs of individuals, organisations and councils. We argue that the substance of the clause gets the balance wrong. There is a very good case for having statutory requirements in the Bill so that not only do we protect, when necessary, but we ensure that potential is realised. That is what social services and education are about in a modern democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that there will be statutory provisions for the new local authorities, and that those provisions will be monitored by the Government's inspectorate? Does not that give those who use the services the assurance they require?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is no. I should like to talk in more detail about social work in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are giving the wrong signals to everyone in Scotland involved in those services if we remove the statutory framework. It could be called flexibility, but it will allow authorities to take the functions of education and social work and tag them on—fag-end them—on to any other committee of the council. As I shall explain in a moment, some very vulnerable groups will be at risk if that happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I am not being mischievous—I am merely attempting to get a ruling from you, because I hope to speak. I have read the clause carefully, and there is nothing about social work in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in amendment No. 149.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is in amendment No. 149, but I was referring to the clause. Will I be in order, Sir James, if I address that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman will be in order. We are considering a group of amendments. When the hon. Gentleman comes to speak—and I look forward to hearing him—he will be perfectly in order as long as he keeps to the amendments before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that clarification, Sir James. We were grateful for your consideration in making sure that an amendment to schedule 14 was included in this group of amendments dealing with education. In a sense, the arguments are similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask Conservative Members to consider the simple concept of balance. What is right for the people whom we serve? How do we ensure that an authority, of whatever political colour, does not have the opportunity to run away from its serious statutory responsibilities, as clause 31 allows?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members on both sides of the Committee are concerned about the many emotive issues in social work. It is vital to highlight the fact that since the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, there has been tremendous progress in every area of social work in Scotland. For example, the working
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
relationship with the children's panel and reporter system has served, more than in any other democracy in Europe, the needs of young people. It is always in need of revision, but it shows that the partnership has worked. Children make up one of the vulnerable groups that requires not only a partnership but statutory arrangements, so that no one is in any doubt as to the lines of accountability, reporting and action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about life and death cases. This is not a debate about engineering departments or even housing departments and the real problem of homelessness. We are talking about a professionally qualified director of social work, with greater responsibilities than other directors, who may be looking at a child abuse case. Those tragic events will take place in every walk of life. But are we to believe that by accepting clause 31 we will allow an appointed officer in some department to deal with that important consideration? I cannot believe that we, as a legislature, would allow that to happen. We cannot run risks with children. But if there are no clear lines of accountability, responsibility and professional integrity and interest, we run that risk. We in the House are not in the business of passing legislation that may put members of any group at risk, whether they be young or old. Is the Minister aware of the consequences that could flow from making the change from a statutory requirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>Another matter worries me, my hon. Friends and Conservative Members—special needs. We have pioneered some of the most innovative services for people with special needs, who need a little support to realise their potential. However, that functions properly in a system of statutory provision because everyone knows his task and that responsibility cannot be shirked. Once statutory provision is tinkered with, the results may flow through every aspect of legislation.</p>
	<p>Why have statutory provision to protect children? Why not leave it to the whim of the authorities? Why not leave it to the whim of the appointed officer? That would not be right. Scotland does not want it. In a civilised society there must be clear lines of statutory requirements. It is crucial to have that for special needs.</p>
	<p>Another facet of the debate relates to groups such as offenders, people with mental health problems and drug users. If an authority did not have a social work committee and its duties were tail-ended on to those of another committee, how much priority would be given to support for drug users when there were competing priorities within a council?</p>
	<p>How much support or funding would be given to mental health programmes when they were measured against other priorities? The issue of offenders is emotive, but it must be shown that we are about rehabilitation. That could not be provided by a laissez-faire approach in which matters are left to authorities and committees. Such groups are vital and it is a measure of our compassion and humanity that provision can be combined with the efficiency and effectiveness of a modern authority.</p>
	<p>A year ago, social workers were charged with a lead role in care in the community. There are problems with resources, but in Scotland there is an excellent opportunity to pioneer and develop with health boards, the social services, housing and the other authorities of councils. However, the crucial point is that the statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
provision should make clear who is doing what. I appreciate that even in my area of Fife there are instances of doubts and difficulties, but lines of accountability enable us to know what is happening.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does existing legislation contain provision for housing directors within local authorities? If not, does that suggest that there is a lesser priority for local authorities to provide housing than to provide social workers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist temptation and merely say that that is not a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not belittle any director of any other department. All provide vital services. However, in education and, particularly, in social work it would be detrimental to many important areas if there was not statutory provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that COSLA does not support statutory retention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The COSLA letter refers to the internal management of local authorities. We could debate that, but suffice to say the document preceded the Bill—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The utterings of Conservative Members are unacceptable. People will appreciate that an important issue has been demeaned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The internal management review predated the Bill.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am trying to impress my point on Conservative Members. Their powers of comprehension are apparently limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The internal management review predated the Bill. If COSLA was examining the issue again, it would have sufficient fears about what was in the document. The hon. Members for Kincardine and Deeside and for Aberdeen, South raised this point. When they referred to the same letter, they waxed eloquent in supporting COSLA about statutory provision, but we do not. Are they willing, however, to support COSLA's advice to kick Church and education representatives off education committees? Will they answer that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one thing that unites COSLA is that the Bill is not wanted?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. At the same time as we are wasting resources and the nation's time debating this nonsense of a Bill, real needs are going unmet. As my hon. Friend pointed out, we need a children's Bill. I hope that those on the Government Benches will remain calm, but they do not see children as sufficient a priority for them to introduce legislation before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the timing of reports and decisions. He must accept that COSLA's letter has just been received by members of the Committee. It is dated 4 March 1994. The hon. Gentleman may not like what COSLA states because it is against his argument. COSLA, which the hon. Gentleman has quoted on numerous other occasions, has said, however, that it supports the Government's proposals for giving flexibility to local authorities while leaving them the statutory obligation to provide such services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a dubious interpretation of much that is in the letter. Labour Members do not accept the letter's implication that we should dispense with statutory provisions. Let me also make it clear that COSLA is dominated by districts. With the greatest respect, districts know very little about education, social work or statutory requirements. Conservative Members may not like that, but it is a fact of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members are so enthusiastic and so excited by the letter and if they accept COSLA's position on no statutory provision, will the Minister and his hon. Friends accept the other part of COSLA's advice, which is to kick teachers and education and Church representatives off education committees? What is their response?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Kirkhope (Lords Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a very good way out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government Whip says that that is not a good way out of it, but this is an opportunistic issue on which Conservative Members will pick and choose. The proposal does not merit further consideration other than to say that COSLA—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA's position has been outlined in its letter. Suffice it to say, we do not accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: COSLA has been standing by the views expressed by its individual constituent authorities. It is perfectly appropriate for the senior depute general secretary of COSLA to state that. However, to go beyond that and state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is understood that fewer than 20 out of 65 Councils support the statutory Education Committee and statutory Director of Education"</p></blockquote>
is unfortunate in light of the composition of COSLA, which has 12 education authorities out of its 65 councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is much more important to realise that the COSLA education committee, which represents councils actually dealing with education, supports the ideal of the statutory committee and statutory director. Bruce Black's letter should be seen in that context. That is the formal view, I believe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend could also have said that COSLA's social work committee took a similar view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman would not make assumptions. I am trying to speak in this debate

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased not to jump to conclusions about what the hon. Gentleman might say. I know that he has taken an active interest in the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very intelligent interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's comment could be construed as a compliment to the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Suffice it to say, I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I said that it is an issue that requires serious debate. In the past few minutes, however we have been distracted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on the points with which we have just dealt. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that COSLA is to be quoted in Committee only when it agrees with the hon. Gentleman and his party or that COSLA wants to be quoted and its recommendations acted upon in relation to regional matters but that, as the hon. Gentleman said, it knows nothing about district matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is always willing to be opportunistic. He simply picks up pieces of paper; he take the brief that is handed out. What we have said is clear. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow said that the COSLA's education and social work committees support the view that we are expressing this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a deafening silence from the Government Benches. If Conservative Members are willing to pick and choose, why do they not do so in this Committee? Why are they unwilling to pick and choose my point about the statutory representation on education committees of Church representatives and teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have been accused of picking and choosing. The hon. Gentleman said that COSLA should not be listened to in respect of education because it is dominated by district councils that know nothing about it. It is the hon. Gentleman—not me—who picks and chooses when we should listen to COSLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention from the hon. Member should not be dignified by a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were discussing social work. We had mentioned the important issues of child care, people with special needs, offenders and people with mental health problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also discussing the statutory procedures that have now been established in social work in relation to the right to complain. Some Conservative Members may fail to appreciate that the statutory provision was not built into the legislation merely to provide jobs for social workers who reach the top of their profession or for members of an authority who want to have an interest in social work committees. Its purpose was to safeguard some of the most vulnerable and sensitive aspects of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
The complaints procedures were established in 1990 and are beginning to work quite well. The process cannot simply be cast to the four winds by leaving it to authorities merely, if they so wish, to set up a committee or to tag it on as an appendage to another committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of inspection teams has been identified. Again, clear lines of accountability are needed. The buck must stop somewhere in social work—with the director and his committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I mentioned the work of the children's panel. A laissez-faire approach cannot be taken to adoption and fostering, because that would mean that people would be unsure whether orders would be approved or reviews would take place. At present, the Government have myriad checks and balances in social work—and I support that—to ensure that the vulnerable are safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is indicative of the importance of the issue that two major inquiries have been conducted into child care in Scotland, which I support. I simply say that we are dealing with immensely important issues. If the Government consider that they can set up multi-million pound inquiries into those sensitive areas of activity, surely it is logical to assume that provision is needed in the new authorities to allow all such work to continue. It is equally important to ensure that there is no blurring of accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen cases throughout the length and breadth of the country where there has been confusion about lines of accountability. That has often had tragic consequences. Surely we should seek to tackle those problems rather than make the situation worse by removing statutory requirements. For all those practicial reasons there is a good case for retaining statutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear arguments that that would conflict with the efficient approach in the new and old authorities to the work of councils. That is not the case. Some people in administration might want the inconvenience of directors and committees fighting for resources to be removed from the state. Surely we are here to serve the clients of the social work department, not the interests of the chief administrators or chief executives and the burgeoning management approach which we see in local government. We should be wary of all this management theory. We look no further than the health boards in Scotland to see an explosion of interest in management but very little improvement on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can have efficient management but with the statutory provision involved. The question of small councils has been raised. When the Bill was published people had no idea how many small councils we had. Small should not necessarily be equated with inefficiency or a lack of concern for the client. Concern has been expressed that some councils might want to move those services to the marketplace. The proposal is supposed to be about provision for need, not about a cash and carry approach to services on the purchaser-provider model, which smacks of the clients' needs being relegated to slogans of efficiency, value for money and economy. There is a problem concerning how some small councils may operate their services. We have a duty to safeguard against any authority, of whatever political complexion or colour, doing what it wishes. When legislation goes on to the statute book it can endure for years and years, so it is important to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
The other question is that of professionalism. We have mentioned this before in relation to local government services. No one on the Government Benches would suggest that the directors of social work or education are not doing a good job. They would not attack their sheer professionalism. An authority might, however, want to link education with leisure and recreation. That cannot be right because Scots value education. Similarly, social work cannot become an appendage of another committee. In a sense the professional identity would be lost. We value professionalism in local government. It is not supported simply for the sake of it: it is supported because of the impact it has on the clients that the whole system serves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We contend that if we decide to pass the clause in its present form we would simply turn back the clock. At the start of the century, pre-war and post-war people fought in the House and elsewhere to have important provisions written into legislation. We are not willing to leave this issue to the marketplace. We are not willing to leave it to the whims of officers, councillors or councils. We are not willing just to leave it so that needs are identified in an ad hoc way in different parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was realised that statutory requirements were needed because a balance needed to be struck between the needs of organisations, individuals and councils. I only hope that some Conservative Members will look at the details of both education and social work. If the Government feel that there is a political advantage in their proposal, they should spell it out. If there is not, and this is merely an issue on merit, to be debated, discussed and decided upon, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment or accept an amendment for further clarification and discussion. That would send a clear message that we care about service and needs. Parliament should legislate accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East made a relevant point about the size of education committees with which I agree.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are entitled to hear the words of the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East. They may not always like what the leader of their party says, but they are entitled to know what he thinks. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let me tell the Government that local interest in education is understandably intense, probably more intense and the education service should, in our view be responsive to this interest."</p></blockquote>
I agree. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, in order to get this responsiveness it was necessary to move housing from regional to district, it is worth while taking education out of the hands of a very large authority and giving it to a smaller authority."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 February 1973; 	<i>c.</i> 205.]</p></blockquote>
Those were prophetic words and we are acting on them today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At that time my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East also supported Labour party policy which was to bring into public ownership the top 100 monopolies through nationalisation. He has changed his mind on that and he may have changed his mind on what he said about education at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister been talking to his colleague, Rip Van Winkle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few things have happened since then. Strathclyde and Lothian regional councils have built up formidable education apparatuses, which are of great benefit to my constituents. I resent greatly the idea of going back 21 years as though nothing has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to Lord Wheatley, his distinguished father-in-law. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South was right to point to Lord Wheatley's reservations about creating an immensely large authority, such as Strathclyde. Paragraph 369 of the Wheatley report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a large area would offer no educational advantages: it would be administratively unwieldy; and it would raise the question whether, with one education authority covering almost half the population of Scotland, it was really worth while to have local education authorities at all."</p></blockquote>
We aim to make local authorities really responsive to local democracy and to have a flexible system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan spoke about costs. He suggested that local government spending on education would be reduced. I am glad to confirm that that is complete nonsense. While the level of expenditure on education continues to be a matter for the authorities, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
Scottish Office sees no reason why it should be reduced. There will still be the same number of pupils in Scotland, and education authorities will have the same statutory duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, I confirm to the hon. Member for Fife, Central, who raised a relevant point about special educational needs in Scotland, that all existing duties will remain. Under section 60 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, education authorities have a duty to establish which children in their area have pronounced, specific or complex special educational needs—which, as such, require continual review—and to keep a record of needs for each such child. Under section 62, it is the duty of an education authority to make certain that its decision for a recorded child includes provision for special educational needs. All such duties will remain in force, and there is no question of their being changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am closer to the Government's view in terms of wondering whether authorities such as Lothian and Strathclyde are too big. The Minister seems to ignore the fact that although people understand that resources available will not be reduced, the scale of those resources available to a local authority the size of Lothian and Strathclyde—I believe that that scale has been used very sensitively in terms of the voluntary sector and specialist services—will disappear from the Bill. What will the Minister do about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am discussing the funding of local authority education. The 30 new authorities may wish to spend more on education, but that will a matter for them. Those choosing to do so may wish to provide the additional financing out of savings accruing from having fewer central administration and finance departments and a slimmer hierarchy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall level of finance available to the new councils, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland announced last December that the level of Government-supported expenditure will take account of the need to fund the transitional costs arising from reorganisation. There is no question of reduced expenditure on education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister with responsibility for education is always very generous. But Opposition Members want to discuss the amendments about statutory provision. If the Government want to make available time for a debate on educational finance, we would be delighted. My point of order is that: we have not discussed finance. We therefore believe that the statutory requirement issue is unrelated to finance, although if the Government want to discuss that, we can do so later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I am happy that the Minister is in order regarding the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am responding to the hon. Member for Govan, who raised these matters of legitimate concern earlier. Like me, the hon. Gentleman has been a councillor. Indeed, he has been much more than that, as chairman of the education committee on Strathclyde. He was entitled to raise the point about funding for persons living in areas of urban deprivation. I can confirm that funding arrangements will provide for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>919</span>
resources to follow needs through the needs assessments and that normal consultations on funding allocations will take place between COSLA and the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is easier for me to say this, because I represent a rural authority, but I am extremely concerned about the educational provision in places such as Glasgow and Edinburgh districts in the new authorities. Of course there will be a resource displacement—it will go from the centre to the suburbs. The Government cannot get away with proposing such provisions without making it clear what they will do to replace the resource displacement that will inevitably occur as a result of those changes in educational provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it clear that the Secretary of State has given the undertaking that he will fund the necessary transitional costs. I can also tell the hon. Gentleman that although there may be additional costs in a few areas, the reorganisation will result in significant savings across Scotland and across services. That will more than offset any additional education costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss the issue of—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Fife, Central wanted me to deal with the other matters.

During the consultations about the clause's proposals, five of the current 12 education authorities, namely Orkney, Central, Borders, Highland and the Western Isles, supported the Government's view and 68 per cent. of local authorities did the same.

I refer Labour Members to the representations of the Labour Party Scottish Council. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The objective should be to create a system in which flexible, corporate working bodies exist within councils, which work in the interest of the community rather than functioning primarily within the confines of their professional disciplines."</p></blockquote>
Not only has the council argued for flexibility, but a key representation came from the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, which—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is entitled to express its view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is entitled to express its view. Does he agree that the Conservative members of Dundee district council supported the retention of the statutory requirement for a committee and for a director, as did the Conservative group on East Lothian council, the Fife chamber of commerce and industry and a clear majority of those who are directly involved in providing education in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The majority of responses were in favour of the change. I have just given the figures for local authorities: 68 per cent. supported the change. It was said earlier that district councils do not have sufficient expertise to express a view.

The chief executives made it clear that education and social work committees had served local government well. They added that the statutory requirement should be repealed, stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be wrong to suggest, however, that the responsibilities for these functions can be discharged only through a social work or education committee. The duties and responsibilities placed on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
council remain, irrespective of whether such committees are established."</p></blockquote>
They went on to explain how such duties should not be examined in isolation, stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nor can these services be seen in isolation, either from each other or, indeed, from other local government services. They have an important interface with each other through, for example, pre-school provision or out-of-school care and have strong relationships with other local authority services, including housing and leisure services."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is impatient. I shall give way to him in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those chief executives stated that there will be no requirement on the new councils to appoint directors of social work or directors of education. They stressed the need for maximum flexibility. In that, SOLACE was supported by many others, including SODA. All concerned have a high regard for the work of directors of education, but are entitled to express their view. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who was a councillor with me a number of years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we were councillors together in 1973. Does the Minister admit that the chief executives and the directors of administration of the 56 districts have a vested interest? They will be looking for jobs, which is why they are particularly interested in taking jobs as directors of education or of social work. Will the Minister confirm that on his advisory committee on internal management—he set it up—there was only one director of social work and no directors of education? The committee was made up of administrators and chief executives. That is why this disgraceful recommendation has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised the issue of the consultation during the compilation of the internal management paper. I should explain that more than 3,100 copies of the paper were distributed. They went to 665 organisations and individuals and our initial distribution focused on local authorities. The hon. Gentleman talks about persons having an interest. That suggestion could equally be levelled against any official in local government, including, of course, directors of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We received a few representations to the effect that the two-month consultation period allowed was too short. In setting the period allowed, we had to strike a balance, but we adopted a flexible approach and extended the deadline for comments. That assisted the Scottish School Board Association, for example, which had specifically expressed a wish to submit comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the consultation about how authorities conduct their business and organise their affairs was covered thoroughly in the paper. A clear distinction must be drawn between those essentially management issues and the separate statutory requirements placed on authorities to provide and deliver education and a social work service throughout their areas. Those duties will remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members apparently want to set in stone the arrangements of the past, by overturning our intentions, first to remove the statutory requirement for authorities to run education and social work committees and, secondly, to remove the statutory requirement for them to appoint directors of education and social work. The Scottish Office does not intend that there should be no education committees, directors of education or teachers on committees that deal with education. We are certain that those things will exist, provided that the locally-elected authorities want them. Unlike the Opposition we do not believe in unnecessary prescription. Instead we wish to give the new authorities the freedom to choose and the power to manage themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that clause 31 could result in local authorities deciding against education committees, directors of education and social work committees or directors? Could not Scotland become devoid of professional management and political control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have complete faith in local democracy. It is perfectly possible at present for an authority to choose, for example, not to employ a director of leisure. That is up to the authority concerned. I have confidence in the good sense of locally-elected councillors. The Opposition's stance is a classic case of their not wishing to allow councillors and locally-elected representatives to make their own choice. It is conceivable in certain circumstances that a very small authority might take the view that the directorship of education should be coupled with that of leisure. That would be entirely a decision for that authority. We do not believe that a prescription should be laid down in the Bill. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, in a nutshell, the issue is about faith in the future? Surely, he will accept that we cannot leave special needs provision and child care to the whims of new authorities. The Minister may want to reflect on what he said. Is he saying
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
that grass cutting will be elevated to the level of special needs provision in education? Is that what Scotland's local government system will provide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is about local democracy. I have confidence in locally elected councillors being able to make sensible decisions on administrative matters of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duties for special educational needs to which the hon. Gentleman referred are in legislation and will remain in it. We will debate a great many other duties fully before those provisions are discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not the words of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no way that I can give way to four hon. Members simultaneously. I will give way to the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) in a moment, but I want to finish my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is wrong to interpret the removal of the statutory requirements relating to organisations as in any way downgrading the services. The majority of the responses to our consultation were in favour of removing the statutory requirements, which, in any event, are not consistent across services. The legislation should provide a supporting framework within which local authorities are free to act. It should spell out what local authorities must do and not how they should do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that we should be thankful for the small mercy that the statutory requirements will remain for provision for social work clients and children in schools. However, if there is not a director of social work or a director of education, who will be responsible for fulfilling those statutory requirements? Will it be the public relations man for the council, the director of recreation or who?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The duty to provide the services concerned will continue. The authority would have to appoint a person to deal with that. For example, if the authority appointed a director of neighbourhood services, he would have to deliver those services. How he did that would be a matter for him. I want to return to what the hon. Member for Fife, Central said about social work, but before doing so, I refer the hon. Member for East Lothian to the representations made by his own district council, which took a different view from him. It said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities should have the maximum flexibility to determine their own management and committee structures".</p></blockquote>
I could have written that for the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister appreciate that the Bill is riddled with powers for the Secretary of State to determine matters in practically every area in which local authorities are involved? Does that not fly in the face of the great belief that the Minister is now proclaiming that local authorities should have the right to total discretion over everything that they do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the Minister recognises the general concern—the hon. Member for Tayside, North probably shares it—that unless councils have statutory obligations in crucial areas, they could relegate many of the other functions that local authorities must perform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statutory duty that requires local authorities to provide the necessary education service will continue. I was asked who, if not the director of education, would be responsible for delivering the service. The legislation puts the duty on the education authority, not on the director of education. Obviously, however, councillors will be bound to implement the requirements of the duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way several times to the hon. Gentleman, and I wish to answer the question from the hon. Member from Fife, Central about social work. That service will remain one of the most important responsibilities of the new local authorities. The Government attach a considerable priority to it. We have taken major initiatives on community care, child care and offender services. Those initiatives have increased responsibilities and improved services. More is to come. We want the new local authorities to take forward energetically the work that existing authorities have begun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the director of social work is the chief professional officer and the manager in charge of the service. The unification of those functions has been considered beneficial by some people, although others consider that is better to separate the managerial task from the professional task. However, the opinion of the elected members of the new authorities will be the one that matters. No doubt, many will appoint directors of social work, and no doubt the majority will be qualified social workers. Other authorities might choose to appoint a director of social work and housing, or perhaps a director of neighbourhood services. It will be for each authority to choose how best to meet the needs of its area. We want to ensure that the new authorities can put in place the most efficient and effective management arrangements suitable for their circumstances. To do so, each authority must make arrangements to ensure that it has effective means of assessing the special social work services of its area, and for meeting those needs. Each authority must
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
ensure that it has sound professional oversight of social work tasks, with clear arrangements for accountability and professional standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear that we are not repealing section 5 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, which clearly states that local authorities perform their functions under the general guidance of the Secretary of State. We shall issue guidance as to the staffing arrangements that will be required, and we shall monitor the establishment and development of the social work services by the new authorities through the independent social work services inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social work committees have done a good job in establishing good quality services. Most notable recently has been the implementation of our new community care policies. I am pleased to pay tribute to the work that those committees have done over the past 25 years in child care and offender services as well. Many of the new authorities doubtless will establish social work committees. That is a sound, well tested and effective way of organising council affairs. But is it the only way? Are the new councils to be allowed no scope for experimentation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way later. Are councils to be prevented from establishing a committee to oversee services for children and young people, for example, or a social strategy committee to oversee all the council's work in the promotion of social well being, whether under the Social Work (Scotland) Act or through community education, housing and other services? Are the larger authorities not to be allowed to have committees for each locality, to which powers can effectively be devolved? It may be said that those committees could exist as well, but that would create a bureaucratic nightmare. Effective management requires clear, simple structures which are well suited to an authority's circumstances. There is no reason why allowing authorities to choose should lead to great variations in the standard of services. The independent social work services inspectorate will develop its role in evaluating standards achieved. I am astonished that the Opposition wish to continue a restriction on local authorities that most authorities do not want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
