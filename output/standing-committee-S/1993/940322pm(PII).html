<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (scotland)Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continuation from col. 1384]</p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I was speaking when we adjourned at 6.30 pm. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian advised me to write down what I was saying just before we adjourned so that I should remember where I was when we resumed. I scribbled on my amendment paper, "Why should it be", but I cannot remember what comes after that.<br><br>
Much has happened in the past two and a half hours. I spent part of the time watching England go down to glorious defeat at the hands of the West Indies on television. I am sure that the hon. Members who represent English constituencies will be pleased at that news! I think that England lost by an innings and so many runs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend pick up the Arsenal versus Manchester United score?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was 1:1 when I left the Library, but I do not know what the score is now.<br><br>
I was speaking to amendment No. 486 and about the successor authorities to the elected councils that are currently responsible for water and sewerage services. The successor authorities will not be elected. The Secretary of State will set up quango water boards and will appoint their members. The boards will not necessarily represent the views of the Scottish people. Why should it be that the big decisions about investment that must be taken over the next couple of years will be made by unelected quangos when they could be made by elected councils that have been put into power by the people who voted for them at the ballot box?<br><br>
I have in mind particularly the North of Scotland water authority which will succeed the councils in my area. It will acquire an headquarters building. Why should the decision on the location of that building be left to unelected people appointed by the Secretary of State when it could be taken by the elected councillors who serve on the regional councils in that area? I understand that new laboratories will be needed to test that the water is sufficiently clean. Why should the decision about the new laboratories be left to an unelected quango, when it could be taken now by elected authorities?<br><br>
The same could be said of many other issues that might arise over the next year or two, including the siting of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1386</span>
sewage treatment plants and the go-ahead to enter into contracts to ensure that water and sewerage provision in Scotland is brought up to date and into line with the requirements of the European Community directive. For all those reasons it is important that "the relevant date" should not mean that the Secretary of State will allow quangos to make the big decisions that should be left to the elected councillors of the present water authorities.<br><br>
You were not present earlier, Sir James, when the news broke about the referendum results in Strathclyde. There was a massive 71 per cent. turn out, of which more than 97 per cent. were opposed to the Government's proposals to set up new quango water authorities in Scotland. If this were a democratic Parliament and if the Committee listened to the democratic voice of Scotland, we should go no further with the proposals. The Bill would be stopped in its tracks and we could all go back to watching television and enjoying England getting gubbed by the West Indies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about planning blight. I fully accept that there should be controls on the extent to which existing local authorities should be able to dispose of land that would otherwise be inherited by successor authorities. However, the limit of £100,000 is too low, especially for urban areas, and may lead to a considerable hiatus in local authority activities as a result of the volume of transaction referrals to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The creation of the new councils will impose a planning blight on new developments between now and 1996 in areas such as community care. That is on top of the existing problems caused by the three-year phasing in of community care reforms. This clause is likely to make that problem worse. First, £100,000 is a very small sum in terms of local government finance. A single home for only four disabled adults could exceed that figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I congratulate the hon. Member. He is going too fast for me and for the Committee, because we are still on amendment No. 484. He should keep his remarks until we discuss the next group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the points made by hon. Members on the amendment. I have listened with interest to the arguments of the hon. Member for Linlithgow, which we shall discuss under the next set of amendments. The people of Scotland will note with interest that the hon. Member for Dundee, East supports the West Indies—[HON. MEMBERS "Hear, hear."]—rather than another country in the United Kingdom. That is also the position of the hon. Member for Paisley, South, is it not, and the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been converted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton asked whether the Minister had a brief on the West Indian cricket match.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong of me—and out of order—to comment at length on the cricket match between the West Indies and England. I was responding to the remark made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East about supporting the West Indies.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0769">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1387</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend show a little gratitude? That was probably the most accurate remark that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has made during our entire proceedings. We do not dispute the fact that England was gubbed by the West Indies, but perhaps we regret it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have a great deal of respect for the hon. Member for Dundee, East. It is a matter of constant surprise that he is not on the Opposition Front Bench. He made an important speech on the amendment, to which I shall respond.<br><br>
I shall explain the purpose of the Government amendments, because they are largely technical. They arise from the need to include joint boards and the Central Scotland Water Development Board within the scope of the clause. Joint boards are generally included in the transitional clauses in the Bill.<br><br>
The effect of the amendments will be that all existing authorities, including joint boards and the Central Scotland Water Development Board, will be required to seek the consent of the relevant successor authority or authorities before agreeing to major financial transactions during the period prior to the changeover to the new councils. As our discussion on the previous amendment made clear, the date on which such agreements will become necessary may vary between the different bodies and will be decided nearer the time. That response is made to the question of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan and I am glad that he is here to hear it<br><br>
The appropriate successor authorities will also vary, depending on the geographic area of the council concerned and the service to which the transaction relates. In a sense, that statement repeats my answer to the hon. Member for Govan. Several points have been made in a more general context during the debate. I hope to deal with them in a clause stand part debate. I regard the amendments as largely technical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister at what stage in the consideration of the Bill he proposes to return to the general issue of the police and the concerns of the chief constable of Strathclyde?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the police funding, a subject of great importance and one about which the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West, replied in an earlier debate. He made matters clear and I have nothing to add to or subtract from what he said.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to amendment No. 474, in page 45, line 46, leave out "£100,000" and insert "£250,000.".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 476, in page 46, line 8, leave out from "£1,000,000" and insert "£2,500,000.".</p>
<p>No. 475, in page 46, line 8, leave out from "£1,000,000" to end of line 13.</p>
<p>No. 477, in page 46, leave out lines 18 to 30.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the limits governing the disposal of assets. Many of my hon. Friends
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1388</span>
have raised the matter before, but now there is an opportunity to discuss the subject in more detail.<br><br>
An obvious question, especially when we are confronted with a Government such as this one, is how they arrived at the figures in the Bill. We have heard before that what began as the "relevant date" in the clause may now become "relevant dates". We want to know whether the figure was plucked out of thin air, was a more reasoned attempt to calculate a reasonable spending limit for successor authorities to discuss with existing authorities, or was merely a first stab at a limit which, following the debate, the Government might confirm.<br><br>
The group of amendments is also intended to deal with the fact that the clause is a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has let me know that at least one hon. Friend on the Benches behind me is still awake. That is very encouraging at this time of the evening.<br><br>
We argue that the clause is a mess. The Government have stumbled through their responses to earlier amendments. Our primary concern is whether the sum concerned will be £100,000, or £1 million. Could the figure be £200,000 or could it be £2 million? Points were made earlier about the number of projects in Strathclyde, for example, which may be planned for commencement between November 1994 and April 1996. The briefing from Strathclyde—or equally a briefing from Lothian or from any number of authorities covered by the Bill—would throw into doubt whether an arbitrary figure will work. We are greatly worried that if the "relevant date" can shift to become "relevant dates", figures for one area might change when applied to another area.<br><br>
It seems that a half-baked proposal is being exposed to the sunlight in the hope that contributions will make some sense of it. We are genuinely worried that the provision will only add to the confusion. Haggling may occur about the cost limit. In the case of a building project that includes a long lead time for legal work, will the cost limit include the fabric, which is worth £100,000 or £1 million, or will it encompass the whole project? Who is in a positon to define and discuss that?<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
Some Opposition Members have mentioned water. I do not wish to take unfair advantage of the Chair by talking about water, which is a sensitive subject for the Government in view of the referendum result that was announced earlier. I am sure that you know the monumental result of the referendum, Sir James. I do not want to go down that road, which would be out of order. Let us consider water authorities, however, because the Minister tabled amendments that would affect water.<br><br>
The crazy Bill will establish three water authorities in Scotland. One will largely cover Strathclyde. We have talked about relevant dates. We are now discussing limits on expenditure. How do those subjects relate to water provision in Strathclyde? One water quango will cover the area and the individual authorities will not be water authorities. Individual, single-tier authorities will, however, collect the revenue for the new water quango in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0770">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1389</span>
Strathclyde. I am conscious from your furrowed brow, Sir James, that that appears to be a mess. The multi-million pound projects that current water authorities are considering are endangered by the Government's desire to move towards a huge quango that is so unpopular in Strathclyde. What will happen to the investment in the important projects? Clause 54 is a mess. The relevant date or dates will be confusing The arbitrary stab at defining limits on projects will make a bad predicament worse.<br><br>
We hope that the Government will clarify the reasons for adopting their figures and explain how the provision will apply in practice. On this of all evenings we would welcome an example that applied to water services in Strathclyde. That issue exercises our minds. I am sure that it also exercises Ministers' minds, especially that of the hon. Member for Eastwood. Eastwood constituency participated in the massive referendum and overwhelmingly accepted the wisdom of the Opposition by rejecting wholesale the Government's proposals for a water quango.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether that is the same constituency that was identified as including 46,655 people who voted against the Government's proposals to set up quangos to run water authorities in Scotland, and only 2,109 who voted for the government's proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to respond to that. Suffice it to say that Strathclyde police and ambulance services will carry out a huge exercise tonight to find the 2,109 people who fouled their ballot papers. I do not want to be side-tracked. We wish to stick to the amendments that are technical and narrow, but nevertheless open a vista for the Opposition, especially on this tumultuous night.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for believing that we had disposed of the Government's amendments. I shall be brief and not repeat my earlier remarks.<br><br>
In local government finance terms, £100,000 is a very small sum. The cost of a single home for only four disabled adults could well exceed that. It is not clear what the clause means. It applies to contracts capable of being extended beyond 31 March 1996. Many local authority service agreements are on an annual basis, with the possibility of being extended by the local authority for future years. The clause can be necessary only where the contract can be extended by the other party without the local authority's consent. In practice, that hardly ever happens.<br><br>
The real problem is that the clause will add yet another layer of bureaucracy. Councils work according to the committee cycles. At the moment it may be necessary to get approval from a planning committee, a housing committee, a social work committee, a finance committee, a health board and a registration department for a single project. If one date is missed, the whole procedure must start again. The Government now suggest another body, which presumably will have its own committees, for projects covering a wide area. More than one new council may have to approve a project.<br><br>
Even if it is possible to get a proposal before the new council, it is unlikely that there will be enthusiasm to fund new projects until they are full operational and the overall situation can be assessed. Safeguards may have to be provided to prevent councils from making future
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1390</span>
commitments too freely. The clause adds an unfair burden on contractors, especially those in the voluntary sector. I fear that, perhaps inadvertently, it will cause a planning blight that will be greatly detrimental to many people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting series of amendments. They deal with giving more or less flexibility to the existing authorities. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central will not take it amiss when I say that I am not sure whether I support the amendments or the Bill. What are the existing authorities? What are the new authorities? My support depends on the answers to those questions. For example, if the existing authorities are directly elected with a mandate, they should have as much flexibility as possible, as against the joint boards and the quangos that are to take over.<br><br>
However, if the existing authority is a right-wing, reactionary small minded Tory authority—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Kyle and Carrick.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right with his completely random example of Kyle and Carrick. I should prefer to see such authorities hoddit doon a wee bit. When the metamorphosis takes place and the new Labour authority takes over in south Ayrshire—or, as I should prefer, in the whole of Ayrshire—I want it to have as much authority as possible.<br><br>
I have just read the Provost's report for the annual general meeting of Ayr constituency next Saturday. It is very well written, comparatively, and highly detailed. Some of the major capital projects proposed by Kyle and Carrick are set out. Kyle and Carrick is an astonishing Tory authority. For some grandiose reason, it is planning a range of capital projects. As a result, it has the highest council tax of any of the four district councils in Ayrshire. Cumnock and Doon Valley, Kilmarnock and Loudoun, and Cunninghame all have very low council tax rates for next year. Instead of reducing its council tax rate, Kyle and Carrick has set it very high because of its capital projects.<br><br>
I was with the Provost yesterday, as was the hon. Member for Ayr. I cannot tell the Committee all the details of that private meeting, but the Provost has stated publicly in the report that I was reading that he is anxious for all those capital projects to be finalised, committed and approved before the shadow authorities take over. He wants to ensure that the new authorities will not have the opportunity to say, "Wait a minute. What you're proposing for the citadel and the south harbour is grandiose and far too expensive. Instead, we want that money spent on housing and on more important services."<br><br>
The issue concerns £100,000 because it depends whether there is £100,000 or £200,000. The citadel scheme is a substantial capital of £250,000 or £1 million, or £500,000 or £1 million or £2.5 million—you, Sir James, know all the amendments so you know what I am talking about, even if I do not. We have already discussed the Burns heritage park and the Tam-o'-shanter experience. That has nothing to do with the fire brigade—it is the Robert Burns heritage park. There is the new golf course at Greenan. They are all major proposed capital investments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0771">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1391</span>
If those projects are not approved by 1 April 1995, they will be between the limits that my hon. Friend referred to in his amendment, and may need the approval of the shadow authority—the Clerk is advising you, Sir James, that I am absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not refer to the Clerk. If he had understood what the Clerk was saying, the hon. Gentleman would not be all that happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall go on to discuss Strathclyde, which is the other side of the coin—the obverse or the reverse, as the case may be. One side is the obverse and the other side is the reverse, so whichever is not the reverse is the obverse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which is the perverse?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave my hon. Friend to sort that out with the Prime Minister.<br><br>
I am discussing projects Strathclyde is undertaking. The hon. Member for Ayr and I have had an agreeable day. We have been agreeing with each other, on and off, for most of the day. We agree with each other on the Ayr link road. The Minister also agrees on that issue, which is unique. Make a note of it in your diary, Sir James. The Minister, the hon. Member for Ayr and I all agree on the same issue. What will happen to the A77 contract? Supposing it falls in the period in between, will East Renfrewshire have any veto on the A77? I hope that the Minister will explain that important point.<br><br>
Let us suppose that the sewage works in Ayr is at a vital stage of tender when the new sewerage authority takes over. Will it have a right to veto the proposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening closely to the hon. Gentleman. Will he relate his points more specifically to the justification for the amendment and to the limit that the Opposition propose?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I started, I said that I was not sure whether the amendment was right. Having thought it through as I have been speaking, on balance it is right to give greater flexibility to the existing authorities. On balance, irrespective of the aberrations of Kyle and Carrick, Eastwood or Stirling—they are minimal, minor authorities—the regions with their mandates and the district councils with their mandates are more directly elected authorities, with a genuine mandate than those that we shall have under re-organisation, with their quangos and the joint boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman a question, to validate the figures in the amendments? How many of the projects mentioned by the hon. Gentleman fall between the Bill as it stands and the amended figure proposed by the Opposition?</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. It depends on the tenders that come in at the time.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said, these are probing amendments. They have been tabled to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1392</span>
show that we want greater flexibility. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside: I enjoyed being asked a question by a non-executive director of Aardwark Clear Mine Holdings Ltd. I thought that an aardvark was a strange South African animal.<br><br>
On balance, because there are now more directly elected authorities—regions and districts with proper elected mandates—than there will be if the Bill is enacted, I am in favour of giving more flexibility to the existing authorities to go ahead with tenders and not to be inhibited by the new quangos and joint boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For reasons that I am perfectly happy to explain at some length if necessary, I cannot, for technical reasons, accept amendments Nos. 475 or 477. The discussion relates to amendments Nos. 474 and 476 which deal with financial limits.<br><br>
The aim of the clause is to allow successor authorities to have a say in the major transactions being considered by their predecessors immediately prior to the changeover. There is no wish, however, to tie up the councils' more minor, day-to-day work in this procedure.<br><br>
The existing financial limits are reasonable. However, the speech of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley was relevant and sensible. On balance, I am prepared to agree that the hon. Gentleman's points about the limits are acceptable. To be honest, there is no magic figure. I therefore recommend that the Committee should accept amendments Nos. 474 and 476 although I cannot, for technical reasons, accept amendments Nos. 475 and 477. The arguments advanced by Opposition Members on the financial limits are perfectly reasonable.</span></p>

POWER AND DUTY OF EXISTING LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ASSIST NEW AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 478, in page 47, leave out lines 43 to 46.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1394</span>
The amendment has been tabled to discover why the Government want the remarkable power in subsection (5):
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may direct an existing local authority to do anything which in his opinion is appropriate for the purpose of putting a new authority in a position to carry out their functions with effect from 1st April 1996."</p></blockquote>
That could be used in a sinister way. The government might have ideas that they want to develop in the Scottish Office or it may be another admission of spectacular defeat, because they will be forced to direct local authorities to do "anything".<br><br>
The Committee has a right to have "anything" defined. The implications are so wide ranging that it is difficult to predict what the word might hold for the local authorities involved. The use of the word is also a continuation of the massive centralisation powers that litter the Bill. Opposition Members would be irresponsible not to ask the Minister to spell out in as much detail as possible the circumstances in which such sweeping powers would be used. I hope that he can dispel our concern. This is by far the most dramatic subsection in the Bill because it contains the word "anything". Will the Minister allay our fears about the Government's intentions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is extremely alarming and deeply worrying. It affects regional and district councillors, and its provisions are very wide.<br><br>
If, for example, the Secretary of State is alerted to a proposed service development of which he disapproves, he could intervene to amend or to prevent it, by using the argument that it would affect an incoming authority's ability to perform that function at a later date. In the case of regional councils, members will be elected at the regional elections on 5 May on the basis of manifestos for the next two years.<br><br>
District councils were elected in 1992 for a four-year term. If the Secretary of State is given the broad power under clause 56 to direct councils, he will be able to dictate the performance of their functions, regardless of the basis on which they were elected. That fundamentally conflict with existing constitutional arrangements, which allow councils to dictate their own performance of the functions given to them by statute, subject to overall financial controls set by central Government.<br><br>
Council members are subject to the discipline of democratic accountability through the ballot box. The proposed power for the Secretary of State would allow him to override elected members in any of their functions as soon as the Bill becomes law. If that view is wrong, the Minister will doubtless say so—but I am greatly alarmed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure Opposition Members about the purpose of the clause.<br><br>
In principle, we believe that there should be a reserve power for the Secretary of State to ensure that existing authorities work to prepare the ground for the new authorities. I can give the hon. Members for Linlithgow and for Fife, Central an example that could conceivably arise. New councils could not be expected to prepare and send council tax bills for the year 1996–97 unless they receive assistance from existing authorities. If they do not receive such assistance, it would be perfectly legitimate for the Secretary of State to intervene using the reserve power—but we hope that the Secretary of State will not have to employ it.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0773">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1395</span>
Subsection (5) provides that the Secretary of State may give directions to an existing local authority to do anything appropriate to assist a new council in carrying out its functions. The power could be exercised either before or after the new councils are elected. Its purpose is clear. The circumstances can be envisaged, for example, where an existing district council might wish to get on with preparing for change, but was being deprived of assistance by a non co-operative region. I am not suggesting that will happen, but it is a possibility. It could happen in West Lothian.<br><br>
The clause's other provisions, although useful, would not ultimately resolve such an impasse. It is in those limited circumstances that the power in subsection (5), with which the amendment deals, might be invoked. I emphasise that I hope that it will not be needed and that all councils will take a responsible and mature approach to the important planning period prior to reorganisation. Nevertheless, this ultimate reserve power is necessary for the Secretary of State. I reassure the Committee the Secretary of State would act only if he considered it appropriate and necessary to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister consult my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) before he said that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not? There could be a general election during the transfer period and my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton might be in a position to exercise the power. It might be appropriate, therefore, to consult him before giving him such draconian powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members forecast that before 1979, before 1983, before 1987 and—[HON. MEMBERS: "Before 1992."]—and they were wrong four times. They will be wrong next time, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What was the Minister's forecast of the turnout in the Strathclyde—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should not have allowed the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley to put his point. The Minister, of course, then had to respond. Let us return to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Sir James. The Government's position is clear this is a reserve power which we hope it will not be necessary to use. We believe, however, that the reserve power is necessary in case there is a dispute between new and existing authorities which could be resolved only by the involvement of the Secretary of State. I assure the hon.Members for Fife, Central and for Linlithgow that the provision will be used only if a new or existing authority requests assistance which could be reasonably provided by another authority. The Secretary of State will use the powers only in such circumstances. As I said, we hope that it will not be necessary to use the powers but we believe that it is essential to have them. I hope that that is an effective response.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1396</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an aside, which I did not catch, about west Lothian. What was that aside?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was simply saying, because the hon. Gentleman had taken part in the debate, that there was a possibility of a dispute between existing regions and new authorities. I make no particular point of it, but there could be a dispute between the existing Lothian regional council and the new shadow authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that there is already an actual dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was more dismayed than ever while the Minister attempted to allay our fears. The subsection is ridiculous. I thought, initially, that it was merely poorly constructed because I have always been charitable and given people the benefit of the doubt. There is no restraint on the exercise of this subsection by Parliament. The Secretary of State would not have to bring an order before the House; this draconian subsection could be used for any purpose without restraint by Parliament either by means of a resolution or in a debate. The Minister gave the example of the council tax but there are many other cases in which the powers would be unreasonable and unwanted by the successor authority and the existing councils. For the important reason that Parliament should exercise control over the Executive and in the absence of any provision in the clause that would ensure that that was done, we have no option but to press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

FURTHER PROVISION AS TO DISCHARGE OF FUNCTIONS BY AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 448, in page 48, Line 24, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3)(a) Every council shall have regard to the desirability of providing an adequate common service for the stocking and professional support of libraries in the schools for which it is responsible and for this purpose shall take account of such services of this nature as have been provided by existing regional councils in its area.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0774">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1397</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) Where two or more councils are of the opinion that the most satisfactory means of providing such a service as is mentioned in paragraph (a) above would be by establishment of a joint service they shall exercise their powers under subsection (2)(a) above whether or not a joint board or committee for the carrying out of other education functions has been established.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment owes its origins to the Scottish Library Association. It is an all-party amendment. It deals with the school library services, which are also known as the education resource services. Those services are presently provided by regional councils as part of their education functions: they are not part of the public library service. Members of the Committee may ask why they exist. Libraries in schools should contain books and other educational materials required by the schools throughout the year. However, schools also need access to a larger collection to use from time to time during the year. In simple language, no school could afford to maintain all that material. To attempt to do so would entail an expense that schools could not afford. It makes economic sense to have a central source so that schools can hugely expand the facilities for their pupils.<br><br>
The school library service consists of three elements: books, other educational materials such as charts, maps, illustrations and artefacts, and staff. In addition, the central services provide important training for librarians working in individual schools. They also provide vital bibliographical facilities so that staff in schools can identify the materials most suitable for the purposes in hand.<br><br>
All nine regional councils in Scotland at present maintain such a service. The question arises: what is to happen to those central regional services when education becomes the responsibility of the smaller successor councils? I suggest that some of the new authorities will be too small to provide a central resource service that is remotely comparable to those which now exist. Even if they could afford to do so—some people suggest that they could not—it would take a long time to build up collections and doing so would be a wasteful duplication of existing services.<br><br>
Other resources held at regional level, such as property, can be expected to be split up among the new authorities. However, the education resource services could not be split up without their value being destroyed. It would be foolish to send stocks on a subject to one successor authority and stocks on another subject to its neighbour. The same applies to staff. Professional library staff are specialists. One member of staff may be expert in back-up for children with special educational needs, another may specialise in mathematics and sciences, and another in computer work or in arts. Splitting up such teams by sending individuals to different successor authorities could destroy the purpose of the system.<br><br>
The central school library services that back up libraries in individual schools are usually provided by the regional authorities as part of their educational role without involvement by the district authorities, which are responsible under the Public Libraries Consolidation (scotland) Act 1887 for public libraries. However, in Tayside, the regional council uses the district authorities' public library service to perform part of the task on an agency basis. Nevertheless, there is still a central service at regional level to supplement the facilities provided in the three districts.<br><br>
In Tayside region the service contains 220,000 books and units of other educational materials. Four
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1398</span>
professional staff run the service and there are 80 professional staff serving in such central services throughout the nine regions of Scotland. Consequently, the Committee must consider the likely effects on the school library services of the abolition of the regions. It is not unrealistic to suggest that they will probably vary.<br><br>
There may be no problem in Highland region, the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway because they will continue as new unitary authorities and there should be no disruption to existing services. The amendment would have no effect there. However, in Strathclyde the regional service could be in danger of being divided up into nine or possibly ten separate services. There will be many reasons why some new councils will not want to act jointly on the entirety of education functions. There is a good case for their acting jointly on this part of education, even when they will run their own separate education show otherwise.<br><br>
Although nothing in the Bill will prevent councils from doing that—I accept that because the Bill provides flexibility—it is unlikely that they will consider doing so unless something in the Bill points them in that direction. That is what the amendment would do. It would force the new councils to do anything in any circumstances; it would oblige them to consider the possibility and, if they decide that joint action is the best way to deal with the problem, it specifies that they are to take that joint action on this aspect of education. Even if they act independently on all other matters, it would force them to consider such action. It would do no more than that. It would not force the new authorities to do anything and would not affect flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman because his argument has particular relevance to the three successor authorities in Tayside. Is he suggesting that a joint committee or joint board should be set up to manage four professional staff and 220,000 books? If not, what joint action does he suggest that the three councils in Tayside should take?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the amendment would force the establishment of joint boards or anything else. It would merely make the new councils in Tayside at least consider the problem and come together to find a working solution. That is the sensible way forward in all the proposals. I believe that the new councils will consider matters, provided that they can see clearly their obligations.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been fortunate in that I have spent much of my life working at my hobbies. Few people can reach my age—that of a pensioner—and be able to say that they have been fortunate enough to enjoy working at their hobbies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend casts his mind back he will recall how, a couple of sittings ago, Opposition Members condemned me for saying that I took on the role of a councillor as a hobby? My hon. Friend has said that he is performing the parliamentary task because he is following the line of his interest or hobby. That is commendable, but the hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley take exception to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go too far back. I want to stress the importance of libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is clearly important. Is my hon. Friend aware that neither of the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen are here to listen to the debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it rather sad that when we are debating an all-party amendment with which no hon. Member will disagree, we should be deprived of the attendance of some hon. Members who should be here. However, I recognise that the pressures on hon. Members' time is such that attendance is not always possible. It is rather odd, though, that both Front-Bench spokesmen are missing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman glanced this way he would see that I can occupy the space normally reserved for my hon. Friends. I can make up for their absence in quantity, if not in quality. More to the point, where is the Minister responsible for education? We are debating a clause that is vital for the education services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Was not the hon. Member for Paisley, South, the Opposition Whip, trying to claim that somehow he was his party's Front-Bench spokesman? He is a Whip, so he cannot be a Front-Bench spokesman. The fact that the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Hamilton are absent shows that they have only contempt for the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with me. I understand that Labour Whips are allowed to speak. Whips in the Conservative party are not allowed to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Would it be in order for me to make it clear that my hon.

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with an important amendment that has all-party support. We should discuss it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1400</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is important. I often regret that the hon. Member for Paisley, South is not on the Front Bench. He would make a substantial contribution—I do not refer simply to his girth. The Opposition Whip has made some of the most pleasant and enjoyable speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's contribution so far is commendable. I am sure that we support the method of operation that he has described. However, does he agree that we are considering normal good business practice? Any good authority will continue to operate such a system. It should not be necessary to include the amendment in the Bill. Can my hon. Friend justify its inclusion</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty with that. I never put my name to anything that I cannot support. My hon. Friend should not tease me. I cannot be browbeaten or forced to do things with which I do not agree. I do not enter into debate frivolously.<br><br>
When one leaves school at the age of 14, libraries are important—especially if one wishes to pursue a career in the Royal Air Force. I did that. I was required to obtain specific academic qualifications. Libraries were important to me. That is why I tabled the amendment. The answer to my hon. Friend's question is that he should wait and see. If one considers an aim to be sufficiently important, one pushes towards it. I know when people are being mischievous. I am privileged to have been able to work at my hobbies. I owe that to library facilities and services in Dundee that were second to none. If only young people today applied themselves to libraries in the way in which I and others had to do many problems in our cities and on our streets would not exist.<br><br>
Scotland has always been proud of its schools and libraries. The great Scottish capitalist and philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie provided wonderful library facilities for Scotland and the world. Scotland provides a more professional library service than England. English school inspectors have pointed that out occasionally.<br><br>
The amendment does not conflict with the purpose of the Bill. It cannot do any harm: it will do a deal of good. One cannot say that about too many legislative provisions. I am reluctant to write provisions into statute. Often, they do not achieve one's aims. The wording of the amendment is important. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every council shall have regard to the desirability of providing an adequate common service for the stocking and professional support of libraries in the schools for which it is responsible and for this purpose shall take account of such services of this nature as have been provided by existing regional councils in its area."</p></blockquote>
The amendment contains nothing mandatory. It does not affect the flexibility of the Bill—the aspect about which we have battled. The amendment merits not only consideration, but debate, so that those who think that it has no positive side can explain to me their reasons for thinking that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 448 and the comments of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I do not need to speak about the amendment at length. I want to reinforce what the hon. Gentleman said about the lack of any conflict that the amendment would create with the rest of the Bill. The amendment would not confront or complicate anything that the Government have sought to do.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1401</span>
I come from a rural area where the library service is essential and supplementary. The specialist services of the library are particularly important in supporting the small local authority school libraries in rural schools. In the Borders region, there is good library provision and schools take advantage of mobile libraries. Long may that continue.<br><br>
I am concerned that the shadow authorities elected in 1995 will have so much on their plate. The essential, but relatively minor, service provision issues—they are not of great strategic, political or financial importance—will get lost, unless the Bill includes a provision to keep such issues at the front of the shadow authorities' minds in deciding how the new authorities will work after 1 April 1996. If the framework is not set up properly at the start, such services may fall by the wayside because there are more important things that need to be done.<br><br>
I do not think that clause 57 is the right place in the Bill to include the provision. But a lot of ingenuity has gone into putting the two parts of the amendment together. It may look inelegant beside the other provisions because there are other, more strategic issues. Taking that into consideration, and for the reasons that the hon. Member for Tayside, North gave—and because it causes no other difficulties—it will strengthen the hand of those who are working hard to provide those essential services, particularly in rural areas. The amendment should be supported by both sides of the Committee. If the Government will not accept it, I shall be interested to hear their reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to say how refreshing it was to have an amendment that has been soundly argued for. That is so refreshing, given some of the rubbish that we have heard across the Room from the Opposition in recent debates. I exclude the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) from those comments. On the whole, he has spoken in a realistic and reasonable manner. His points about the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North were well put.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to address the comments about the amendment with reference to the island councils. They are small, rural councils, such as those described by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. How do those councils cope at the moment? Their method of coping would be fundamental to these arguments.<br><br>
With a few complimentary words to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, I close my remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel strongly about libraries. In Lothian region, 210,000 books and other educational aids are held in the regional education resource service. The service is administered by five professional staff, plus ancillary staff.<br><br>
Lothian has 47 professional librarians in its schools. It would be impossible for any one of the Lothian successor authorities—perhaps four, after Report—to provide itself with a comparable stock of books and materials, or with a balanced team of professional staff.<br><br>
The Minister might argue that the Bill allows new councils to act jointly to run an education resources service, such as that which exists in Lothian, and that the amendment is unnecessary. That is legally correct but if it is only unnecessary, it will not do any harm and its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1402</span>
exhortatory nature will do good. Secondly, other provisions in the Bill are not legally necessary and for example clause 23, which deals with decentralisation schemes.<br><br>
Councils are required to have such a scheme, but have been given in subsection (2) four separate matters which may be included. They are not legally necessary, but constitute signposts for what councils should consider including.<br><br>
The Minister might say, as he did to representatives of the Scottish Library Association and in his remarks on clause 32 stand part, that the Government will issue guidance on many education functions, and that the guidance will include something about libraries. However, it is not likely that the Government will want to steer the new councils too strongly, and the Minister has said that guidance will not be issued until the shadow councils come into existence in a year's time. The provision in the Bill will start minds working straight away.<br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
The Minister might argue that the clause confers general joint action powers and that it should not include specific provision for particular services, but school library services or library services in general are not dealt with elsewhere in the Bill. If the Government's purpose is worthy, such an objection should not be allowed to stop the amendment being accepted. I strongly support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my support to the amendment. The school library service is an invaluable central service with an established track record. It is a system-wide service to schools that allows access to central specialist materials and skills. It is above and beyond the existing district council library system and school libraries. It is strongly supported by school and district council librarians. As a teacher, I made use of the facility and can vouch for its excellent value.<br><br>
The amendment would make the Government utilise an existing service efficiently rather than destroy it, replace it at great cost and cause disruption.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the work of the central school library service and ask that the Government ensure that this ancillary facility remains as an asset to the new local government system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has all been said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has all been said, but it is important to note the depth of support for the amendment. I speak in support of it not only as a member of the Committee, but as the father of a 12-year-old who is a voracious reader and has gained greatly from the resources of the educational libraries for the region that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to.<br><br>
The amendment is important because of the risk that some new education authorities may be very small. I hope that the Minister will leave schedule 1 alone as far as my part of the world is concerned, but were there to be further consideration of subdividing the proposed East Lothian and Mid-Lothian local authority—a single-tier authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0777">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1403</span>
of East Lothian perhaps—there would be only six high schools.<br><br>
I do not know how small some of the other authorities, such as South Ayrshire, are, but they may have very few schools and could not possibly sustain a proper schools library service or a proper range of support services for those libraries. It is all the more important that there should be a legislative requirement to ensure that there are safeguards. That is the aim of the amendment and I support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least I have discovered something that I have in common with the hon. Member for East Lothian. I also have a 12-year-old who is a voracious reader.<br><br>
I do not want to delay the Committee by commenting on the absence of the hon. Member for Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What has happened to the Secretary of State? I believe that he was originally to attend, but that he had cold feet. On the two, or perhaps three, occasions when he has turned up, he has sat at the back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us not ask about right hon. and hon. Members who are not in their place or not in Committee. I am sure that all of them are working somewhere if they are not working here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not criticising the behaviour of the hon. Member for Hamilton. I was just commenting that it is unfortunate, to put the case at its mildest, that the hon. Gentleman has such contempt for Scottish library services that he has absented himself from the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Is it in order for the Minister to make such outrageous remarks? I defend my hon. Friend's commitment to all services in Scotland, including the library service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Anything that is not relevant to this all-party amendment is out of order. Let us stick to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know whether any of the local authority libraries in Scotland keep video recordings of "Newsnight"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question, to which I do not know the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Resign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neither do I intend to resign.<br><br>
I was simply making the point that the debate is an important one on an important subject, and that the hon. Member for Hamilton has deliberately absented himself. That is a disgrace to the Committee and to the important subject raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister interested in developing the unity of purpose that has arisen with regard to this important amendment on the subject of libraries, or is he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1404</span>
willing, at the expense of the debate, to engage in mere political knockabout at the expense of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not indulging in political knockabout of any sort I was referring to the importance of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we have had enough political knockabout on both sides of the Committee. Now we should stick to the important amendment moved by the hon. Member for Tayside, North, and supported by hon. Members from both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you rightly said, the amendment has been supported by hon. Members—who are actually present in Committee—of all political parties.<br><br>
I have every sympathy with the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North. It has support from all political parties and its purpose presents no problem. My advice is that there are a couple of legal problems, however, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr referred to one of them. The amendment does not cover the islands councils, but that is not a criticism of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North. I fully agree with him about the importance of library services. That is not in dispute.<br><br>
I have received legal advice on the amendment. If my hon. Friend is prepared to withdraw it, I can give the Committee the absolute guarantee that the Government will either table an amendment on Report that meets his point or we will meet it through regulations that will be published by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am mystified by what the Minister has said. First, he said that the amendment does not cover the islands councils. He has got that wrong. The amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every council shall have regard to the desirability".</p></blockquote>
Why does that not include the islands councils?<br><br>
I am not sure, however, that we need to include the islands councils. The amendment also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"(b) Where two or more councils are of the opinion that the most satisfactory means of providing such a service as is mentioned in paragraph (a) above would be by establishment of a joint service they shall exercise their powers."</p></blockquote>
I cannot imagine boats travelling between Orkney and Shetland with books on them. That would be a ludicrous way to operate. Therefore, we do not need to include the islands councils. The amendments refers to contiguous authorities on the mainland. Therefore, the Minister's remarks are not relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for the hon. Gentleman's imagination. I simply make the technical point that the amendment refers to existing regional councils and not to the islands councils. It is—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not criticise my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North for that. All I am saying that there is a technical and legal problem in my accepting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that my hon. Friend the Minister has met the objectives of those who tabled the amendment, but he is being subjected to a constant

barrage of abuse from the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who is speaking from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am in charge of the Committee. I wall protect the Minister from the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley if necessary. He is now behaving himself. The hon. Member for Ayr is wrong. He is making an implied criticism of the Chair, which I cannot accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may conclude by making the position clear. For the reasons that I have explained and because of the legal advice that I have received, I cannot accept the amendment as drafted. I give my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North an absolute assurance that the spirit of the amendment will be met either by a Government amendment on Report or by regulations tabled by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what my hon. Friend the Minister has said and the firm commitment that he has given, other hon. Members and I, as well as the Scottish library service, will be delighted. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 479, in page 48, leave out lines 28 to 38.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can leave now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is encouraging me to give up early, but we are not here to do the Government's bidding.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1406</span>
The Minister's comments are becoming a bit wearing Is there no way to tie the Minister down to concentrate on the issues before us rather than him indulging in petty behaviour concerning my distinguished hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton? He is out working for Scotland and building on the momentous result of the referendum that was held in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I seek your guidance so that Conservative members of the Committee can help the hon. Member for Fife, Central, who is having to carry the entire burden of leading for the Opposition. The hon. Member for Hamilton has become a semi-detached member of the Committee. Conservative Members are concerned—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Hamilton are able to look after themselves. They do not need the assistance of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South.<br><br>
If an hon. Member is absent, he is, more than likely, working on behalf of his constituents outside the Committee Room. If the hon. Gentleman would like me to take a note of every time an hon. Member leaves the Committee Room, it could be done unofficially, but this is not a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<p>10.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your helpful comments, Sir James. I do not want to stray far from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to assist my hon. Friend in getting to the important issues. Would he be willing to allow the hon. Member for Dumfries, the Under-Secretary of State, to intervene to remind Conservative Members that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton is indeed an honourable Member, who behaves with honour?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the final word on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems unfair in some respects, because I am surrounded by people making interesting comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timothy Kirkhope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Come on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government Whip says "Come on", but it is his hon. Friends who are raising these mischievous issues. As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) said, not only is my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton an honourable Member, he is a gentleman. That is evident.<br><br>
I return to the amendment, from where we started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that we have not started. I am troubled by the fact that the rabble which constitutes the Conservative members of the Committee is suggesting that we make progress. If I can do so, that will be excellent for all concerned.<br><br>
The amendment is about the proper delivery of services in Scotland after the Bill becomes law. We are worried that the delivery of services will be a mess. Are the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0779">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1407</span>
Government intent on including the clause in the Bill because they are running scared and know that the councils that they are creating are too small to deliver effective services? The Government's approach is a travesty of the truth of the Bill. They cannot disguise the fact that the 30 single-tier councils proposed in the Bill cannot replicate the present quality of services in Scotland. That is self-evident, even to Conservative Members.<br><br>
The reason for this group of amendments—and for the clause—is because the structure created by the Bill will not work. Every time we discuss a clause, we return to the proposition that single-tier councils cannot cope. Whether the subject is police, fire, education or social work, either joint committees or joint boards will be recreated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman regularly criticises the need for joint arrangements. Yet according to his policy doctrine, which I understand was penned by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, joint boards and arrangements are considered necessary for certain services in some areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no conflict between that contribution and what I am saying. We are discussing a single-tier structure that cannot provide services. Because the single tiers, or the unitary councils, cannot cope, there are clauses such as this one. There should be joint arrangements if there is to be a purchaser-provider development<br><br>
The issue is whether the councils are too small to cope with the services that will be provided. We are trying to rationalise the approach to provide a centralised provision that would build on the economies of scale that we currently enjoy. That practical suggestion might improve this crazy Bill. But there is another, more sinister development in this clause which relates to the purchaser-provider model that I mentioned.<br><br>
In the health service, the Government's obsession with the market means that everyone must be in the business of buying and selling services. It is clear that not only are small councils unable to cope but the Government are moving further down the market road. The clause is designed to allow services to be bought in from other councils.<br><br>
We are left with the impression that the measure is about the politics of a Government discredited by, for example, today's water referendum in Strathclyde.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ninety-seven per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded by my hon. Friend that 97 per cent said no, but I shall not pursue that point Sir James.<br><br>
The councils are too small to cope, and on top of that the Government are moving rapidly to the purchaser-provider model, which stresses the politics of service delivery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made much of the purchaser-provider model and referred to the health service. In Grampian and the north-east area where there are more GP fundholders and one of the two original trust hospitals in Scotland, the purchaser-provider model
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1408</span>
works very well in the interests of consumers—the patients—in that area. Why is the hon. Gentleman so sure that the purchaser-provider model will not work in the best interests of the council tax payers in the local authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you will not allow me to discuss the future of the health service in Scotland, Sir James.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's second point we must remain suspicious of a Government who want to create a number of small councils that cannot cope and then use that to feed another part of their philosophy—the purchaser-provider model. I am unclear whether this is an exercise in politics or in trying to improve services. My doubts lead me to believe that it is the former, that this is an exercise in politics that has little to do with the services that people enjoy and more to do with the Government's aim of privatisation.<br><br>
The other matter raised by the amendments is economies of scale, which takes us to a key issue for the Government—value for money and cost effectiveness. It cannot be right for a Government who preaches the rhetoric of value for money to create a situation in which the economies of scale will be lost and extra costs will be incurred by bureaucracies being established throughout the country. The council tax payer will end up paying a great deal more. Economies of scale are vital. It is interesting that the Government are keen to recreate, through police boards, fire boards and joint committees for education and social work, the same structures as those that exist now—they are currently democratically elected but will not be in future. The Government risk losing the economies of scale, and that would result in higher costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered that in smaller authorities councillors will be nearer the people, so the people will know who they are. Perhaps that will reverse the ghastly situation in which few people turn out to vote at local authority elections? One of the great problems for democracy is apathy, which can kill democracy. More people may turn out to vote for the new smaller councils. All the aspects to which the hon. Gentleman referred are worth having if it means that more people turn out to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for Tayside, North, I was in local government for 14 years and I am not sure that smaller councils—and all this nonsense from the Government about taking power back to the people—make any difference in reality. People are not interested in chief executives, administrative officials, councillors and instructors; they are interested in the quality of service. People are concerned about issues such as transport, street lighting, roads and social work, and not about the idle notion of councillors being closer to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend take into account the fact that in most parts of Strathclyde the percentage turnout for the district elections is almost exactly the same as that for the regional elections, even though one authority is much larger than the other? That shows that in Strathclyde there is no direct correlation between the size of the authority and the percentage turnout.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0780">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1409</span>
Can we draw any lessons from the fantastic turnout in the referendum on Strathclyde water, which was announced today? An enormous percentage of people must have voted. I am told that it was 71.2 per cent. Strathclyde is a large area: half the population of Scotland turned out not because it was a local matter but because it was an important issue covering a large number of people in a wide geographical area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend confirms many of my views about this matter. It is important to note that when a service was being threatened, as in the case of Strathclyde water, 1.2 million people turned out to make a protest vote and to show the Government that they do not want what they are proposing. There was a 71 per cent. turnout and 97 per cent. said no to the Government's proposals. That confirms my view that when services are threatened, the electorate responds in large numbers. People are not concerned about structures; they are more concerned about the quality of the services that they receive. It is important to discuss economies of scale.<br><br>
We should discuss some of those services, because Committee debates can be abstract. Services in Strathclyde include central purchasing, information technology, chemist services, consumer standards—which my hon. Friends will refer to later—and the assessor. Those are expert specialist services provided to a high degree of professionalism. They are cost effective because they are pooled and centrally used: this matter goes beyond the rhetoric of buying-in services.</span></p>
<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>Can authorities afford to buy in those other services? If so, from where would they buy them? Individual councils, possibly with the exception of Glasgow, will not be able to buy such specialist services: they are expensive for a single-tier authority, but very cost-effective for an authority like Strathclyde. Where are the services to be bought? The amendment would ensure that there is a centralised system that retains the economies of scale and exposes the politics of purchaser-provider for what they are. It also makes it clear that the Government's plan for single-tier authorities will not work and will lead only to a mess.</p>
<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members will recall that when Lord Wheatley compiled his report on the previous restructuring of local government, he emphasised that economies of scale were important. He used that as a strong justification for setting up the regions and some of the larger districts. The principle remains important today.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central stated eloquently that many local authorities will lose that advantage. Many departments will suffer also. On the face of it, the clause appears technical, but it will have a profound impact on a range of services. Not least among those services is the consumer and trading standards service. My hon. Friend referred to central services such as purchasing computers and some of the larger-scale administrative services. In addition, there are other services that may be affected, such as the analytical services, the regional chemist, and so on.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1410</span>
I shall restrict my remarks to the area of special needs, social work and community care. I have received a letter from Enable, which used to be the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped. The director of Enable, Norman Dunning his deputy Hugh Stewart and the organisation's legal adviser, Colin McKay, have taken a close interest in the Committee's progress. They know a great deal about community care, and their organisation has a good record in the provision of such care and in lobbying on its behalf. Their concerns are genuine and serious. We should listen to them, and I encourage the Minister to take on board the points that they make.<br><br>
First, they direct the committee's attention to specialised services. A thread has run through our proceedings about the inability of smaller authorities to deliver services effectively. That is especially true of service delivery to people with dual impairments, such as the deaf and blind, and of delivery to people with profound learning difficulties, and to autistic children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member aware of the services that are available in Shetland islands, in Orkney, and in the western isles? Are they inferior to mainland services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, although sometimes the full range of service is not available. Disabled people and children must travel to the mainland to obtain some services. The hon. Gentleman speaks a lot about cost-effectiveness. If he were to check, he would find that the services that we are discussing are much more expensive to provide in the areas that he mentioned. If the hon. Gentleman suggests that such examples should be applied across Scotland so that the same level of service is preserved at greater expense, that is a curious argument.<br><br>
I hope that the Bill is never enacted. But if it is, the only solution open to local authorities will be to provide the joint arrangements with which the clause deals.<br><br>
Conservative Members make an assumption that neighbouring authorities will come to an arrangement, which may or may not be the case. If neighbouring authorities cannot agree on price or on service and so cannot come to an arrangement, what happens to adults and children with specialised needs? Will we go back to the days when they had to travel further away from home and become institutionalised? There is a consensus to move away from that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I caution the hon. Gentleman to be careful. City dwellers such as he do not understand the vast areas involved in massive rural constituencies. It may surprise the hon. Gentleman to learn that the children of some of my constituents often have to travel distances greater than do the islands children for access to the specialist services about which he is talking. The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that everything does not happen in the cities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, services have to be provided in the rural areas. If the hon. Gentleman suggests that they should be equalised down everywhere else, I should have to refute that argument. However, I do not think that he is suggesting that. There are problems in those areas as well, so we should not try to apply a solution across the board. As a child, I dropped a steam iron on my foot, but I have never suggested that everyone else
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0781">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1411</span>
should do that. It did me some good at the time because I did not do it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is a young man, he will not realise that it was the fashion throughout the entire western world in the 1960s and early 1970s to go for what were called economies of scale. Some managers and people such as myself opposed that and we have been proved to be right. Most of the attempts to achieve economies of scale turned out not to produce them. The reverse is happening now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Strathclyde and Lothian regions could produce scientifically based figures to prove that that argument is wrong.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for accusing me of being a city dweller because that is a good point. If we must have an authority in my neck of the woods, which we do not want, the hon. Gentleman has come up with a good idea: Paisley should become a city. When it does, which is up to the Minister, I hope that the hon. Gentleman gets the credit for being the first to make such a suggestion.<br><br>
Rural areas include my home town of Johnstone. If the clause means a drift back to the days of institutionalising adults and children who require specialised services because the services are not available locally, that will lead to a far higher level of inflexibility. Flexibility is a favourite word of Conservative Members, but the clause will lead to greater inflexibility. Many people, especially youngsters, will have to face the trauma of moving away from home.<br><br>
I thought that the aim of community care was to allow adults and children to stay as near to home as possible and in a community that meant something to them. If neighbouring authorities cannot make arrangements, the grave danger is that children and adults must move further away.<br><br>
There is also a problem for existing service users who happen to find themselves on the wrong side of one of the—I almost said gerrymandered, perhaps I will say it—gerrymandered council boundaries. People in Helensburgh with learning difficulties attend adult training centres in Dumbarton. If everything works out well and the two authorities reach an arrangement, that is fine. But what happens if they cannot agree the price? Where will adults in Helensburgh go for the service that they require? If they have to go much further afield, residential care will have to be considered. I believed that both sides of the Committee wanted to move away from residential care.<br><br>
Before I became a Member of Parliament, I worked on a project called "Growing Concern" in Glasgow. It took adults for employment training from five sub-regions of Strathclyde. That service is just inside the Glasgow boundary, but it is closer to Lanarkshire. What will happen to such projects if Glasgow and Lanarkshire cannot reach an agreement? What guarantees will exist for deaf children in Eastwood constituency who travel to Gateside school in Paisley? What will happen if East Renfrewshire, West Renfrewshire and Mid Renfrewshire cannot reach an agreement? Perhaps services will continue as they are. However, that is only a possibility. A possibility is not good enough for worried parents. They want guarantees.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1412</span>
I wish to consider registration and inspection of residential care. Local authorities currently have a duty to register private and charitable residential care homes. They also have a duty to inspect local authority and independent homes. That protection is vital for the most vulnerable people in our community. Voluntary organisations are waiting for an urgent, definitive answer to a question: will local authorities be able to transfer the statutory function of registering and inspecting homes to another local authority? The Bill is not explicit enough about that. Smaller local authorities may not have the required specialist staff to inspect and register homes. Some homes are highly specialised. Perhaps only one or two Strathclyde employees look after the whole region. In a smaller authority, it is more difficult for the inspectorate to be independent.<br><br>
What can be done? First, the Minister could accept the amendments. Enable speaks on behalf of many voluntary organisations, social services and education departments. It asks whether the Government will guarantee to monitor residential and day care for people with special and complex needs. If so, is that guarantee absolute? Will such monitoring be carried out through the social work in inspectorate? Can the Government guarantee that no current users of services will be disadvantaged because they happen to live on the wrong side of a boundary? That problem could affect the lives of many. What guidance will the Government publish to ensure that standards of inspection and registration are maintained? Hugh Stewart and others from Enable have raised those points. I hope that the Minister will deal with them seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw hon. Members' attention to a letter that most members of the Committee have received from Shetland Islands council. The council has anxieties about amendment No. 237. The amendment proposes to extend the scope of clause 58 to include—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Amendment No. 237 is not in this group of amendments. The hon. Member might wish to wait until it comes up for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is late at night, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has said. The hon. Member for Ayr, with his many interventions, has attempted to be both Whip and on the Front Bench; we know that he is exhausted by all the things that he feels he must do on behalf of the Committee. I suggest that if he allows the Minister to reply occasionally, we should not have to listen to the hon. Gentleman's advice. The same conclusion would be reached.<br><br>
In a sense, the provisions in the clause can be excused because the Government have not thought through the Bill. That is demonstrated time and again as we debate the clauses. The work has not been done. There is half an idea: there will be some arrangements for certain services, joint arrangements for others, and then they busk it for the rest. There had been much of that from the Government. Perhaps one should sympathise with them because, plainly, they felt that they had to adhere to a timetable that would avoid the planned local authorities being a major point of debate in Committee when the regional and European elections were taking place, and so they introduced a half complete Bill.<br><br>
11.15 pm<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0782">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1413</span>
Earlier, the Minister said that he would introduce regulations and that he accepted the spirit of some things. When certain people in the Labour party suggested that some Bills should simply have enabling clauses so that there could be amendment by regulation, they were accused of taking a dictatorial and even Stalinist approach to local government. Yet, clearly that is how the Government plan to tidy up their ideas. They have been found out; the wording of the Bill shows that there has not been adequate thought to bring into effect the aspirations set out in their own document. I remind the Government that, on trading standards, their document said that they wished to maintain and improve on the standards achieved by the old authorities, in line with the principles of the citizens charter. But nothing in the Bill allows us to have confidence that that will happen.<br><br>
There is voluntarism in the arrangements. There is a contradiction in that the Government and many organisations have spoken in praise of the trading standards service, but the Government have not made firm arrangements to ensure the continuation of the quality, thoroughness, effectiveness and efficiency of the service that the trading standards authorities currently deliver.<br><br>
Perhaps I may remind members of the Committee of the role of the trading standards service. At present, the service is provided by 12 authorities—nine regions and three islands. At the outset of the Bill, the proposal was for 28 authorities, and it is now 30 authorities. Those 30 authorities may come together in an ad hoc, voluntary arrangement. They would not have to do so; they could refuse and stand alone. They could abandon trading standards or the quality because it might not be cost effective for them. That, of course, would give rise to great problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned by the argument that my hon. Friend develops. He is right. With the advent of the single European market and given the fact that products manufactured in this country compete with imports from all over Europe, the only way in which British manufacturers can ensure a level playing field for their products and imported products is for there to be effective trading standards departments to ensure that the proper quality of product is on the market. My hon. Friend suggests that the Bill will undermine the effectiveness of trading standards departments. That is bad news for British business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I shall show later, I believe that that view is strongly supported by the CBI. It is as concerned as my hon. Friend about the matter. Once again, that demonstrates that the Labour party is the party of business and the economy rather than the Conservative party, which has run out of steam because it has been carried away by an ideology of deregulation and of breaking down. It uses the word "choice", but that really means the choice to walk away from responsibility or an authority's ability to turn its back on the standards that have been agreed. The Government should not do that. I hope that the Government will accept that the amendments offer them the chance to show that they want to be consistent.<br><br>
The objective of the trading standards service is to promote, maintain and develop fair, competitive trading in the marketplace based on agreed national, European
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1414</span>
and international standards. The Government would not disagree with any of that. In a different context they would say those very words.<br><br>
Let us consider the specifics of what the service does, such as dealing with vehicle fraud and the clocking of cars. We all know the problems we face when we buy second-hand cars; there are many ways to delude the public about the quality of the car they are buying. The number of write-offs that have been welded together, put back on the roads and sold that trading standards officers have found are legion. We all know the slogan "one careful owner". The Government have been one careful owner of the British economy for the past 15 years and what a mess they have made of it. A Government who have lost 40 per cent. of their manufacturing base and have got £50 billion into debt cannot be trusted. It is just like the misrepresentation of the one careful owner in the car advert that trading standards officers must deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an economist. He should know better than simply to quote the size of a base. Productivity is important, not the base size. Would he turn his mind to that productivity and the unit labour costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As someone with a degree in economics I must one day have a lengthy debate with the hon. Gentleman. Although I have a degree I have not had the experience of failed business as he has. Perhaps I should take some advice from him. It is not just a question of productivity. In an economy it is surely also the number of people who are employed and the health of the people who get the wealth from that employment. Not to employ people in an economy fails them not just in terms of productivity or standard of living—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. We do not want to wander down the economic road.<br><br>
Trading standards officers also deal with trading fraud and counterfeiting. There has been a huge rise in the counterfeiting of goods particularly high-quality goods such as perfume, after shave and custom design clothing. I believe that the style of clothes is called grunge and it is what all our children want us to buy them. It has a little label on it saying which company it is made by. The problem is now that not just markets but shops are selling counterfeited custom goods at £70 or £80 for simple jackets and T-shirts. It is becoming a massive trade. Whole companies are now set up in some countries to provide this stuff to Britain. Trading standards officers have the international experience and networks that come with the present economies of scale.<br><br>
Let us consider the application of consumer safety standards. Every Christmas Britain is flooded with dangerous toys. The trading standards officers must always dig them out. People buy toys to please their children and their families without the knowledge of the construction techniques that make a toy a danger. Again trading standards officers have worked up that sort of expertise.<br><br>
My final point relates to credit and illegal money lending which, as the Minister knows, is very prevalent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0783">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1415</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton knows, loan sharking goes on in every town and city in Scotland. Trading standards officers are fighting it daily. No one would disagree that that was their correct remit and they carry it out very well at this particular moment but the argument must be whether there should be an arrangement for those standards to be put in one department across the present regions or on some larger scale that will come about with 30 local authorities. Every piece of evidence from the Institute of Trading Standards Administration argues that it is necessary for the economies of scale which the hon. Member for Tayside, North mentioned to come into play where trading standards are concerned.<br><br>
As has been pointed out, the people who work in the field of fraud—of deluding the public into buying poor quality goods—do not limit themselves to small towns or to small local authorities. They are an international trading organisation. The people who import fraudulent customised goods, and sell them in markets or to shopkeepers or to the respectable retail trade are an international bunch of crooks. When they have entered an area such as the west of Scotland, only a network of officers from, for example, Strathclyde, Fife or Lothian, can work out that networks are operating and can cut them off at source and at the point of sale. We argue that the matter should not be left to chance. To do so is nonsense.<br><br>
I turn now to my final piece of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was my penultimate piece of evidence. My final one is a submission from the CBI. It was referred to by the Institute of Trading Standards Administration in its letter—which states that it consulted all its contacts—
<br><blockquote><p>"trade associations, major producers, retailers and consumer organisations"—</p></blockquote>
in putting together its evidence.<br><br>
The CBI clearly states of trading standards departments that
<br><blockquote><p>"No local government department has a greater role to play in our economic well-being"</p></blockquote>
and that
<br><blockquote><p>"Industry needs all the help that trading standards departments can give to create and maintain a level playing field".</p></blockquote>
I think that we would all agree with that.<br><br>
The CBI then states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a growing concern among CBI members about the fragmentation of regulatory services which may follow local government reorganisation".</p></blockquote>
No service is more important to business than the trading standards service. All the submissions make that claim.<br><br>
Our message to the Government, particularly in amendment No. 606, is that the matter should not be left to chance or to an ad hoc arrangement. It would not be sensible to leave the progress that trading standards organisations have made to a voluntary arrangement. It is important to put in place a structure. The service has not been established in the Bill as a joint board, as the police and fire and some other organisations, such as passenger transport authorities, have been, but why do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1416</span>
we not include in the Bill the provisions in amendment No. 606, which would allow a service agency to be set up through a solid agreement across the new authorities' boundaries to keep the values that the CBI considers important?<br><br>
The Minister's civil servants, in the document, "Shaping the Future—The New Councils", state that the Government
<br><blockquote><p>"acknowledge the growing importance of this service"</p></blockquote>
and that it is important that the work is carried out
<br><blockquote><p>"in an efficient and consistent manner".</p></blockquote>
The latter cannot be realised by fragmentation of the service, so I ask the Minister, when he has finished his conversations across the table, to think seriously about the need to include in the Bill a solid arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I inquired of the hon. Member for Fife, Central why the hon. Member for Hamilton left during his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am more interested in what the Minister does, since he can stand up when I have sat down and tell us that he accepts the spirit of the amendments and will not leave the service to voluntarism but will introduce a logical scheme to bring together trading standards authorities and the other services that have been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of the comments that have been made should be dealt with. I accept without hesitation that certain services require a critical mass to operate effectively. I disagree with what has been said, in that I have never accepted that size was necessarily the factor that decided critical mass. I accept that there is a size below which the service will not function adequately, but I disagree with the suggestion that because certain bodies—in this case, the regional councils—were set up in the 1970s, the critical size was then found for the services that they provided. I have grave doubts about that. I believe that one needs to examine economies of scale very carefully. All hon. Members have received the same representations. I read them in the way that I used to read the representations made to me when I went to a company to sort out its problems. People always tell one that the departments that they run are the most important and must be retained. My experience was that those were the first departments to need examination, as they were probably overmanned and underproducing.</span></p>
<p>11.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he has read the evidence from Tayside regional council's trading standards department. The evidence refers to the special investigations unit, which has a special expertise in dealing with the major frauds referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). A similar special investigations unit could not be supported by the small unitary authorities that will replace Tayside region. How does the hon. Gentleman answer that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I do not accept all representations at face value. Secondly, my judgments are based on my retails experience. I know that the people who talk about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0784">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1417</span>
what happens in shops and stores have no experience of buying in bulk, in the United Kingdom or abroad.<br><br>
I accept that there are instances of fraud and that the Customs has a responsibility. That is often overlooked by people who do not understand that we, as a trading nation, depend on the Customs service. However, I do not accept that the trading standards services necessarily have made the massive impact described by Opposition Members. I do not wish to run down their very effective work, nor the importance, for instance, of picking up the second-hand cars that should not be on the road. They do a very good job in that regard, but we must be careful about the effect of trading standards officers in the high street.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that, although trading standards officers might not intervene directly in the affairs of high street stores, they can have a great effect on those stores' profitability by stopping them being undercut by counterfeit goods sold off market stalls or by back-street traders? Only the maintenance of adequate trading standards departments safeguards the good and honest high street traders who are a vital part of our society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As long as we have open markets, goods will always be sold under legal conditions that are entirely different from those that obtain in the high street. Trading standards officers do not have the same control over goods sold on market stalls as they do when goods are vended in high street shops and stores. I do not want to bore the Committee with a discussion on the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and legislation covering merchandising. I used to lecture on that aspect of trading. We should not overstate the importance of the job of trading standards officers. The criticial mass needed to pick up the fraud described by Opposition Members can be done by a team of two people. It does not require a massive organisation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Govan may look at the sky, but I am speaking from direct personal experience. In Birmingham, a team of two people did more in months than a team of 20 had achieved in years because they kept to a narrow remit. The critical mass for that operation was two.<br><br>
Talk of economies of scale must be considered with care. We should not accept all the evidence presented as factual. People who want to protect what they already have—that includes Members of Parliament—are defensive about any possible change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put down a marker that the important subject of children's panels can be dealt with later in the Bill's consideration. I have just one question for the Minister to answer when he winds up the debate. The directors of planning—especially Alan Whyte, their secretary—have raised the serious issue of whether the smaller authorities will be able to provide specialist services using archaeologists, ecologists and scientists. Has it been addressed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. The highlight was the excellent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, with which I entirely agreed. On behalf of my hon. Friends, I warmly welcome the hon. Member for Hamilton back to the Committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1418</span>
There is a difference of view between the two sides of the Committee on these matters. We believe that many authorities will wish to consider a wider range of service delivery options than in the past. I make no secret of that opinion, and no apology for it. Authorities which restrict their vision to single-service delivery options pass up significant potential benefits for their clients. Clause 57 makes provision for authorities to purchase services from other authorities, which fulfils a commitment in the White Paper. I believe that the flexible structure proposed is very sensible.<br><br>
The clause is in line with the commitment given in the White Paper that authorities would be provided with a flexible legal framework to enable them to choose from a wide range of providers including. In most instances, other local authorities. However—and this relates to the amendment—there may be some circumstances in which the availability of this power might not be appropriate. For example, the Government do not consider that work subject to compulsory competitive tendering should fall within the powers granted to local authorities under the new provision, given that there is a clear private sector market for such work. As such, therefore, the Secretary of State would intend to make regulations excluding CCT work from the new arrangements. Amendment No. 479 would remove the Secretary of State's power to make such regulations.<br><br>
In relation to the previous debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, the amendment would take away the power under which the Secretary of State could make regulations covering school libraries. As I have said, that is an option that the Secretary of State might wish to pursue in the spirit of the undertaking that I gave my hon. Friend in the previous debate.<br><br>
In addition, the new provision is not intended to encourage the establishment of large trading empires. The Secretary of State therefore has reserve powers to prevent such an occurrence—powers which the amendment would remove.<br><br>
Opposition Members have made a number of interesting and useful points but I believe that the clause provides a flexible framework for local authorities and ensures that the new powers will be used sensibly. That is the point of the provisions relating to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Opposition Members have criticised the principle of voluntarism. The Government are completely committed to that principle. On that there is a philosophical difference between the Government and the Opposition. Some of my hon. Friends have raised detailed points, which I shall consider. However, the clause should remain unamended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given a disappointing and dispiriting response even though he has been honest enough to acknowledge that for the Government this is a philosophical and not a practical issue about the delivery of services. We shall divide the Committee because of that unacceptable response.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 236 to 238.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am sorry to interrupt, but it is important to put on record that I have just learnt that the broadcasters, who occasionally cover our proceedings for the people in Scotland, put in a bid to cover our sitting on Thursday morning. They believe that we may be debating an important matter in part II of the Bill. However, the bid has apparently been refused.<br><br>
Given that hardly any Standing Committees are sitting in the mornings and the Bill's importance to Parliament and the people of Scotland, can you, Mr. Martin, take the matter up with the authorities to see whether the Committee can have the coverage that many people in Scotland think it deserves and demands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me, but I take on board the hon. Member's comments. The House has decided that the Committee may be televised. That is important for those who reside in Scotland and who do not have an opportunity to come here. I hope that the hon. Member's point of order and my comments are taken on board and that the House authorities will look into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. The Government have no knowledge of these matters. It is obvious that, in terms of exchanging information, the broadcasters' relationship with the Opposition is closer than that with Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for taking the Committee's time by considering amendment No. 237 in detail. However, I promised my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1420</span>
Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) that I would raise this significant matter.<br><br>
The words
<br><blockquote><p>"includes any local authority in existence prior to 16th May 1975"</p></blockquote>
in the amendment would, at a stroke, add to the Bill the provisions of two local Acts—the Zetland County Council Act 1974 and the Orkney County Council Act 1974. Those Acts embrace the provisions for statutory undertakings.<br><br>
11.45 pm<br><br>
I understand that subsection (6), as interpreted by subsection (8), covers and exempts statutory undertakings which, in the main, relate to harbours and ports in Orkney and Shetland Can the Minister assure the Committee that the Government will not remove the reserve powers that are part and parcel of the 1974 provisions and give the councils powers for
<br><blockquote><p>"any purpose which is in the opinion of the Council solely for the benefit of the county and its inhabitants"?</p></blockquote>
In 1972 and 1973, the measures governing Scotland and England sensibly contained provisions to sweep up old, updated local legislation after reorganisation. It is right that measures in the 1990s should do the same because, although the Orkney and Shetland council areas will not change, some of their functions may alter.<br><br>
The people of Orkney, Shetland, Scapa Flow and Sullom Voe rely heavily on the reserve powers to limit the damage done by the oil industry and to encourage local crafts and fishing and farming enterprises. As the Montgomery report and local legislation in the mid-1980s showed, the Government supported that aim and endorsed the county councils' approach to the issue. I hope that the Government will accept amendment No. 237 and thereby assure the Committee that they do not intend to remove the reserve powers that are so vital to the area.</span></p>
<p>11.48 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House</i></p>
<p>12.3 am</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are ready, but we are awaiting the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We have often heard the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, express concern about hon. Members being absent from the Committee. Have you ever known of an occasion, Mr. Martin, when there was no Minister of the Crown in a Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can remember when the Chairman was late for a Committee. That is not criticism of the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Let me make it clear that I had completed my short introductory remarks and that I was awaiting a ministerial response.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1421</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has raised a perfectly proper point. I have consulted during the suspension for the Division, and I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants. It may be helpful if I put the detail in writing to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that Zetland county council is satisfied with the negotiations? I talked to the convener, Mr. Thomason, at his request.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the hon. Gentleman has raised a perfectly proper point and sought an assurance. The amendments are purely minor and technical. I can respond positively and give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance on the question that he raised about the Zetland County Council Act 1974.I shall send a copy of the letter on the technical matters that I propose to send to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire to the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</span></p>
