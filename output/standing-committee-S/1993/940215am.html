	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I seek your guidance about the order in which the amendments appear on the amendment paper and the effect that that may have on the order in which we vote on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursday 10 February, amendments Nos. 109 and 110 appeared on the amendment paper in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and myself. They related to the creation of the unitary authority of Clackmannan and Stirling, which would include the authority based upon Falkirk district council. On 11 February, however, amendment No. 120 appeared in the name of the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), which said very much the same thing. On the amendment paper, amendment No. 120 appears before amendment Nos. 109 and 110. As the Member representing Falkirk, I find that strange because my hon. Friend and I had already tabled amendments. The wording of amendment No. 120 and amendments Nos. 109 and 110 would have exactly the same effect—to create an authority called Falkirk based on the boundary of Falkirk district council. I do not understand why the amendments will not be called in the order in which they were tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a valuable point of order, which I should like to think about. Perhaps, he should raise it again before 12 o'clock, by which time I hope to be able to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. A general problem has arisen. Last week, I had a discussion with the Clerk and I received an unsatisfactory series of answers about why some amendments are taken first. First, I was told that it was a matter for the printers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not proper to refer to discussions with the Clerk. The hon. Member can raise his point of order without going into them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do that. It was your fellow Chairman, Sir James, who asked me to hold discussions with the Clerk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decisions about the order of amendments do not appear to be taken on the basis of logic as they are in the House. On the Floor of the House, the Speaker decides which amendments to take and in which order to take them, according to logic. If one amendment is taken first, that is because it is logically sensible to do that. The amendments that follow it are also selected according to
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
logic. They are chosen irrespective of what time they were tabled of how many paragraphs they add to or delete from a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to you, Sir James, and to Mr. Martin, your co-Chairman, that you should examine that procedure so that logic takes precedence over printers' decisions, how many words are added to or deleted from a Bill or any other criteria. In dealing with the future of local government, we are dealing with people's lives, their jobs and their services. Those criteria are much more important than whether a printer thinks that an amendment should appear first or second on the amendment paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the importance of that point of order, which supports that raised by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). I shall consider the matter later today, and I shall respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I have noted my comments about the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) at column 237 of the 	<i>Hansard</i> for 10 February. I acknowledge that those comments were inaccurate. On that basis, I have written to the hon. Lady to apologise for any embarrassment that I have caused her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the courtesy that I expect from any representative of the Kingdom of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I draw your attention to column 84 of 	<i>Hansard</i> of 3 February, which records the allegations of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about the Conservative group on Tayside regional council. Those allegations are inaccurate. The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Tory group of Tayside regional council voted against the proposals in the Bill".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3 February 1994; 	<i>c.</i> 84.]</p></blockquote>
Through public statements and letters to the press, the Tory group has made clear that that is not the case. I hope that your comments about doing the right thing, Sir James, have not been lost on the hon. Member for Dundee, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has corrected the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. That is the first time that any member of the Conservative party has directly drawn to my attention those remarks. I thank the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and others because their actions led to a headline in my local paper which stated that the Tories were "upset by McAllion". I would have paid money for such a headline. I unreservedly withdraw any allegation that the Tories on Tayside are opposed to proposals that will wreck education and social work on Tayside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a marvellous note on which to begin this week's proceedings. As long as McAllion does not annoy the Chair. I shall be even more delighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I hesitate to raise another point of order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
about the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) when he has been gracious enough to acknowledge his mistakes of last week, but I have received a note from my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). Last week the hon. Member for Ayr and the Minister said that they were expressing the wishes of the people of Luss. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton tells me that at a meeting in February 1993 Luss community council said that it wanted to stay with Dumbarton. As far as my hon. Friend knows, that remains the position of Luss community council. He also tells me that on Sunday he spent much time in Luss and met many residents who, to his astonishment, were dismayed that the hon. Member for Ayr had not even taken the time to set foot in Luss to hear for himself what the local people wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a matter for me, but I am sure that hon. Members will return to it at some stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. As far as I am aware, the comments that I made about Luss have the full approval of those who are involved in the community council. I do not withdraw my comments in that debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is about time that we proceeded with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. This is a valid point of order. I have studied your selection of amendments, and I am disturbed that amendments Nos. 67 and 68 have not been selected, they are important and deal with the detail of the boundary of East Renfrewshire. I appeal to you, Sir James, to reconsider your original selection so that the amendments can be considered when we discuss Eastwood, Renfrew and Inverclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the amendments have not been selected. When I respond to the points of order raised by the hon. Members for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), I shall incorporate a reference to the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should also like to speak to amendments Nos. 109, 110, 113, 30 and 38. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central will also speak to amendments Nos. 30 and 38. He is a former leader of Fife regional council and has more knowledge of that matter than me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first discuss amendment No. 25. Many hon. Members bring large books into Committee. When I told someone last night that I did so too, but not to raise my stature in the Committee, he said that it might be better if I stood on my books to do that rather than read from them. I have brought with me a volume of the Wheatley commission report because it is not only a cure for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Insomnia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, insomnia. The report is also interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering amendment No. 25, it is important to read page 188 of the Boundary Commission report of 1969. In paragraph 766, doubt was expressed about whether a council of the size of Central region—it has a population of 272,000—was big enough under the Wheatley principles. It is still necessary to examine those principles. Paragraph 766 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is therefore possible to identify three regions in the part of Scotland under discussion—the Clyde Valley, the South West, and the Falkirk-Stirling or Central area. It seems to us that the choice lies between one region or three."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 769 discusses Central region. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The South West fall short in terms of population, the Central region in terms of extent and distinctness of definition."</p></blockquote>
Serious doubts were expressed about whether a council of the size now encompassed by Central regional council, and that which would be created by amendment No. 25, was adequate for the delivery of services under the Wheatley principles. Could the delivery of those services, which had been placed on local authorities in the time between the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 and the Wheatley conclusions, be achieved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is not to create or identify a particular council. That is a problem—we all have to admit that. Personalities and style of operation have crept into the councils of particular geographical areas. People identify proposals for a unitary authority as the council that they know, with all its faults and, perhaps, all its benefits. Sometimes the perceived faults can outweigh the perceived benefits. The Committee must try to find objective criteria by which to judge whether an authority is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for a unitary authority in central Scotland for the area that is currently encompassed by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
Clackmannan, Stirling and Falkirk districts has been made well in terms of cost, which the Committee examined when the Pieda report was discussed The Minister and his officials treated the report seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was the treasurer and then the leader of a local authority. I also took a degree in economics—one of my specialist subjects was the examination of local government finances. The Pieda report was the result of rigorous analysis and it did not contain many of the flaws that are alleged to exist in some of the reports produced for the Government. The report would stand up to the test of a Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, CIPFA, analysis. Much has been said about CIPFA and its credentials as well as its ability to analyse local government. We would not find a great deal of fault with the analysis of costs. I hope that the Minister will examine that seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have previously asked whether such an authority could deliver services better. That remains the principle. If the Government are of a mind not to discuss delivery of service, but just enabling someone—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be aware that members of the Committee have received a submission from Labour-controlled Clackmannan district council. It is entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An Enabling Vision For Clackmannan As A Unitary Authority".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 4.1 on page 4 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clackmannan District Council has enthusiastically embraced the concept of enabling and working in partnership."</p></blockquote>
How does that tie in with the hon. Gentleman's views?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's curiosity will be satisfied when I have completed my speech. I take that matter seriously. I know the area well and take nothing away from the council's view or the way in which it has delivered services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking to a Conservative councillor last night who said that at a Conservative party meeting the Secretary of State for Scotland praised Clackmannan council. As it is a Labour council, he would not necessarily do that in public. There is much that is good about Clackmannan council. I am not trying to dodge the issue, so I shall come back to it later as it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wheatley report said that local authorities must be able to provide the services with which they are charged. If they choose to do it in a different way, because of their local democratic structure and their opinions, that is up to them. That is what local democracy is about. If we, however, as a Parliament, want to draw up a boundary system for unitary authorities, we must take our task seriously. Should a council wish to provide services directly, it must be capable of doing so. The Government should not be doing silly things such as introducing structures in the hope that some councils will be forced to move in a direction that fits in with Government ideology. Councils must, ultimately, be able to provide services, because that is their function. If we do not give them the necessary size of area and resources to do so, we will disable them. It is all right to enable them in other ways, but disabling them will do a great disservice in
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
respect of the services they provide and to those whom we are responsible for looking after through our delegated powers to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the Government's proposal for boundaries could adversely affect the provision of services. In terms of its boundaries, Central regional council has a population of 272,000 people. Most of the people who live in Central region are concentrated in the south and south-eastern corner within a 10-mile radius of Stirling town centre. I was leader of Stirling council, and we often argued the case of those who used our services and had to be subsidised by the local taxpayer. There were, of course, benefits, such as the creation of wealth. Eleven out of the 19 services that local government would have to provide under a unitary authority would have to be provided in the Stirling district area by a joint board or by a contract arrangement with an outside provider. Because of their size, councils would be disabled and could not provide those services directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider joint boards in terms of education. I have taught children with special educational needs. The provision of special education was the Cinderella of the system, but, thank goodness, things have improved in the past 10 years. A larger authority, with a large resource base, can provide such a service to anyone and everyone. There is, in a sense, a cross-subsidy between those who do not require such a service and those who do. The smaller the authority, the less chance there is that it will have the flexibility and multiplicity of support services required for education. Educational psychology services, which are not necessarily simply available for special educational needs, are similarly provided. The same is true of many other services. Such provision would be seriously damaged if an authority was not big enough to provide it in a unitary fashion without having to put the services out to contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Catholic education in Central region is provided at two main schools. St. Modan's is in Stirling and St. Mungo's is in Falkirk. There was a third school in Alloa, in Clackmannan, but it became so small that it had to close because the children could not be provided with adequate educational opportunities. The children who went to that school now attend St. Modan's, as do the children in the Denny area. Although it is a Catholic school, we could be talking about any school. It so happens that in that area there is a specific focus on Catholic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the pupils in the Clackmannan and Denny areas would come under the Falkirk-Clackmannan proposed authority. A total of 60 per cent. of the pupils at St. Modan's would be in that position. We have had letters from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) to say that pupils can go on the buses under the present arrangements. In future, they will be able to do so under a placing request. That is not really the problem facing St. Modan's; rather it is the problem of ending up in an inadequately resourced authority that cannot maintain the fabric of the building and the opportunities for a broad curriculum. As the school has to strive harder and harder to bring its pupils in from other districts outwith the unitary authority of Stirling it will find that some of the parents will choose schools that are more convenient and better resourced and in the bigger authority. There will be a terrible imbalance, because Stirling will have a population of 81,000 and Falkirk and Clackmannan will have one of 190,000.

That imbalance will damage the fabric of the school. St. Modan's will become less attractive and parents will stop sending their children to it. Parents stopped sending their children to the school in Alloa before it was closed as it became less and less attractive. It was still viable but less attractive. That is what happens when a small authority is given one school and 60 per cent. of its pupils come from outside. Serious damage will be done. Mr. John Oates is not only the head teacher of St. Modan's but my former geography teacher. I have known him for many years. He has put the case very strongly as have the archdioceses of both Glasgow and Edinburgh. The case has not been answered adequately.

Much of social work has already been devolved into administrative areas. In reality, the force of a social work team comes from its size and its variety. When that is broken down the ability to provide that service is damaged. Wheatley held many debates about what would happen to those services and proposed that responsibility for social work and housing should go the regional authority. There must have been some sense in that; Wheatley argues it logically. Councils have proven in the main that they are capable of providing housing maintenance and allocation at a district level. The problem arises when there is a Government policy such as Scottish Homes, which takes the discretion away from the councils and starts to drive the building of houses from the centre. That is happening in Scotland now. The districts are left running after the coat tails of a large provider of finance and a large strategic authority, often to the detriment of the immediate demands and needs of their people. Housing could function just as well on a larger scale and would probably be able to argue against Scottish Homes. At present there is a terrible imbalance, because the districts have to run after the coat tails of Scottish Homes, because it provides the bulk of the money and sets the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of all the other services will be subject to the same arrangements. Fire services and the police will have to be provided on a joint-board basis. I am told by people who live in Lothian and Borders that even though Lothian sees itself as a good provider and an innovative and enterprising council, the people in Borders are told the service they are getting and then receive the bill. It is called precepting in England; there may be a different term for it in Scotland. A precept is levied on those people. There is an imbalance in the joint arrangement and that would happen if Stirling went in with Falkirk and Clackmannan on a joint-board basis. It would be so small—at less than one third of the proposed authority—that it would be repeatedly dictated to by the larger authority. That is part of the present cry against the regions. The regions do not necessarily take into account the needs of each district equally. I hope that clause 23 will address that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to expenditure, an analysis has been carried out of how people in Central get their money and where they spend it. People in Clackmannan tend to go into the Stirling area to spend rather than into Falkirk. The transport networks similarly head into Stirling not into Falkirk; they do not travel between Clackmannan and Falkirk. The pattern of movement, expenditure and house building are set out in the Pieda report. I know that the Minister will read it carefully before he finalises his opinions, assuming that he is open to suggestions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
change. That pattern is broken up by the proposed arrangements and there are many arguments to show that that is wrong. The best way to unify it is to have a unitary authority for Central.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industry is well balanced in Central. Most of the heavy industry, such as the petrochemicals, is based in the Falkirk area while commercial and office accommodation is much more advanced in the Stirling area, although Falkirk is beginning to catch up. There is a balance throughout the region of people working in the two different sectors. That, too, will be broken up. All the heavy industry will be based at one end of the proposed authority and commerce and shopping will be in the Stirling area. The transport networks make people realise that the region is integrated. The Minister should seriously consider the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, the Government seemed to be responding to bids to create smaller authorities. Labour Members are flexible and creative—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I acknowledge that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) finds the concept of creativity humorous but Labour Members must take it seriously. I think that people in local government take it seriously too. They are willing to consider what the Government's actions of last week show to be their wishes, and to respond to those. To that end, my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), our hon. Friends and myself put forward amendments that would create a second option for serious consideration by the Government. In that option Clackmannan and Stirling would be put together and Falkirk would be left as a unitary authority, covering the present Falkirk district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I returned to the pages of Wheatley to see what was said about the matter. It was very interesting. I looked at the district maps on page 192 and could find no Clackmannan. I then looked in the relevant appendix on page 420 and there was a proposal for district 23, Falkirk-Grangemouth, population 143,000, which is the present Falkirk district. The proposed area 24 covered Stirling-Clackmannan, with a population of 117,000. An interesting feature of that proposal was that the district did not have responsibility for education and other services, yet it was much larger than the Stirling authority proposed in the Bill, with a population of 81,000. Kincardine village was in the proposal for Clackmannan-Stirling, but not the Kincardine division of Fife, which the Government's proposal, if forced through, would use as an attempt to link Clackmannan with Falkirk. The purpose of the proposal at that time, I believe, was to extend the authority to Kincardine bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also referred to the debates of the time, to try to find out how, 20 years ago, the decision was reached that we did not need Kincardine in Clackmannan. I searched and searched. I read the debate on Central at column 513 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of 20 February 1973. There was no amendment for Kincardine. I read the Local Government (Scotland) Bill. The Government, in their wisdom—Lord Younger was then the Under-Secretary of State for Development at the Scottish Office and he spoke in that debate—had removed from the Wheatley report the proposal to put Kincardine into Clackmannan. It was not debated because it was not in the Bill. The Conservative Government realised that it was not sensible to put Kincardine into Clackmannan and put it in Fife instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the boundaries left as they are, Clackmannan district would not be connected to Falkirk district at all.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
They are divided by a river without a bridge across it, except at Stirling. The Government's proposals appear ludicrous when viewed together with a map of the present local authorities. A Clackmannan-Falkirk authority is not possible without taking a piece out of Fife to join it. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central will speak in more detail about the taking of a piece from Fife. It has struck me, however, that it is necessary to drive for six or seven miles from the bridge at Kincardine to Oakley in Fife, and it would be equally possible to drive to Alloa, six or seven miles in the other direction. Points 14 miles apart would be joined in a conglomerate authority, just to link Falkirk with Clackmannan, which makes absolute nonsense. How will the people of Oakley relate to Falkirk district or Falkirk town?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As probably the only member of the Committee who has lived in Kincardine, perhaps I may take the hon. Gentleman back a few years. I do not advance the argument for Kincardine or detract from it; I simply make an observation. I went from Dunfermline to live in Kincardine and, at that time, a large part of the community identified either with Falkirk or Alloa. That was represented in support for the local football teams. I suspect that there may have been a change in the way that Longannet power station is staffed and that many more Fifers have moved to Kincardine. My personal observation is that that is a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the matter seriously because patterns of living may change. I, too, support the Bairns—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is said that one can take the man out of Fife but that one can never take Fife out of the man. But the problem does not exist now. More and more people from Kincardine go to and see Dunfermline as their focal point. There is a pattern of people going either to Dunfermline or to Stirling to do their shopping. That is a commendation for the development that has taken place in Dunfermline. I doubt whether many people in Kincardine today have a pattern of life that often takes them into Falkirk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been doing some work on the problems caused by the express bus from Edinburgh that runs through Bo'ness and Grangemouth into Alloa. It does not stop anywhere else; it uses the motorway. I examined bus patterns and the people in that area told me that they can hardly ever take a bus from Alloa to Grangemouth or Falkirk, or vice-versa. Plainly, that stems mainly from commercial pressure and from the fact that people drive, but it also shows that people do not take a bus in that direction. They do not recognise the connection, as it was perhaps recognised when the hon. Member for Ayr lived there. However, I take seriously the matter that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would create a Stirling that would lose. As I said to the Minister, there is an irony in the situation. There is no doubt that a county town has a tremendous amount of power because it is a seat of government. The county town of Stirling has had such power and has thus been able to run the county for a long time. That is probably one great reason for the resentment against settling the region in Stirling and continuing the tradition. I admit that the political streak in me says that if the Government opt for the Stirling proposal, those who will get the heel of Stirling off their neck will heave
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
a sigh of relief. There would be a change in the pattern of working and local government control. Stirling would lose 900 jobs. As a former leader of Stirling district council, that grieves me, because it is wrong that people and the economy should suffer in that way. It is calculated that Stirling traders will lose £4 million per annum in income from those who see Stirling as their workplace and the place where they shop. Studies have shown that there will not be the resources to provide services. I have said that to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister aspires to the vision of some local Conservatives who have the vision of the hon. Member for Stirling—the Minister of State, Department of Employment—who has the vision of Hayek, an American economist. The view is that a local government is not necessary and that one can simply buy everything in the market—the market will provide. We are not here to force such a decision on people, by making them so unable to cope that they have to enter into arrangements that are not to the advantage of those who receive the services. As I said to the Minister, such an approach would perhaps damage the Conservative party in the long term. We urge the Government not to take that course of action, but to opt for a more sensible and balanced solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commented on education, and there will, perhaps, be parallels in many other services. I do not think that Stirling will be able to provide 81,000 people with the level of service that is currently provided by the district authority or the regional authority, which would become a unitary authority, without a large hike in taxation or a large increase in Government grant. I have heard that the Government have been generous to Stirling since it became a Conservative authority. For how long can they do that? I believe that the subsidy is worth £25 off the council tax in an increased grant for the coming year. I doubt whether the Government can continue to subsidise at that level and that will have an impact on the people of Stirling. I fear that either the provision of services will go down or taxation will rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a word or two about Stirling later if I catch your eye, Sir James. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to give the wrong impression about the distribution of revenue support grant. The distribution of that grant—not the total—is agreed in a very complex formula and as a result of technical discussions between the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Office. There is no question of it being biased one way or another against any authority. The hon. Gentleman knows that the formula is technical and that it has to be agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is trying to be helpful, but he is talking to someone who was the treasurer of a council for a long time. I studied local government finance at university. I understand the formula and I understood that Stirling was a Labour authority. I do not wish to score party political points, but it was a Labour authority and five authorities that did not fit the formula were singled out. A special category was created—the punishment cell—in which we were always placed with councils such as Dundee and Lothian. That was the reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Members of the Government could not possibly be biased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stirling was a Labour authority that challenged the Government. No one needs to make any apologies for that. The Government have deserved challenging, and certainly deserved it during all the time that I was in local government. However, it was always the case that authorities such as Stirling that challenged the Government were subject to a different formula. In the same way, I note that the authority in the area in which I live has received a derisory increase of 0.08 per cent. in its grant this year while Stirling has received enough. I have spoken to a Conservative councillor who tells me that Stirling's grant is worth £25 off the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall, however, move on. I do not think that the Government will be prepared to subsidise any local authority to that level, or even higher. Therefore, the consequences will fall upon the people or they will lose services. The problem with Stirling is that it is too small to be able to sustain the resources necessary to keep the education service or the large services going properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay a compliment to Clackmannan council. Over the past decade I have watched its work and noted that it has been very dedicated. It is a small authority serving 47,000 people. It does not have a particularly high rating base and, as a district council, it deals with a limited number of services. However, it deals with them well. As the leader of Stirling council, I was involved in many discussions with the people of Clackmannan and I know that the same model of enabling, to which the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) referred, was used in Clackmannan as in the council on which I served. That did not mean going to the private sector to try to find a market solution. It meant being creative and doing those things in partnership with the private sector when that was the best way to do them. It also meant performing statutory tasks in council, but, when necessary, coming together with other organisations to create a dynamic partnership. That was successful in Stirling in the decade before 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can quote no better source than the current leader of Stirling district council, Keith Harding, who is a Conservative. By chance, we met in a petrol station a few weeks ago and he said that he believed Stirling council could be as creative in the 1990s as the Labour administration was in the 1980s. He paid us that compliment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay a similar compliment to Clackmannan. Within the scope of the limited services that it has to provide, it has been a tour de force. For example, it has put double glazing and central heating into all of its public housing stock. It has removed 20-year-old central heating systems because they are likely to break down, and has replaced them with brand new ones. Clackmannan is one of the model authorities. It has done a tremendous amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is simple and my colleagues in Clackmannan are aware of it. Because it serves only 47,000 people, Clackmannan will be forced into an alliance with Falkirk, which would be disproportionate and very much resisted. I know that the Minister considers vox-pop responses. In responding to the Pieda systems 3 analysis, 70 per cent. of the people of Clackmannan said that they did not wish to be allied with Falkirk. That was the response even before any costings were made. The local council has run a campaign for
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
people to sign letters saying that they do not want to be attached to the proposed Falkirk-Clackmannan district. More than 10,000 people have signed such letters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know—and I am happy to supply him with the details—that there is no pattern of expenditure from Falkirk to Clackmannan at the moment. About 7 per cent. of the expenditure pattern goes to Falkirk from Clackmannan; very little goes in the opposite direction. The little that does is probably due to Stirling Warehouse, which is Britain's largest furniture warehouse, and if that is not included, there is unlikely to be any expenditure going the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The travel-to-work patterns are different; the movement is towards Stirling. The analyses of the Wheatley commission and of the Labour party, which has discussed the matter in Committee, show that all the patterns put together Clackmannan and Stirling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently there was major public transport expenditure on a three-lane main road—the Eastern distributor road—to take people from the southern part of Stirling straight through to Clackmannan. Alongside that road is a development—approved by the Scottish Office—comprising leisure facilities, a new sports stadium in which Stirling Albion plays and clothing and other shopping facilities. That will be the hub of the pattern of travel back and forward from Clackmannan to Stirling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clackmannan deserves to be linked with Stirling because it would gain the benefits of the commercial base that it requires to maintain a decent and stable level of tax for its residents and resources for providing services. If we do not consider that aspect, we shall be regarded as trying to force an unnatural connection between Clackmannan and Falkirk and push Stirling into becoming one of the smaller authorities in Scotland, when there exists the simple alternative of linking Clackmannan and Stirling districts to make a unitary authority. Such a move would take away the problems with Kincardine because there is no logic in including Kincardine in the Falkirk-Clackmannan proposal. Indeed, there is no logic in including it in a Stirling-Clackmannan proposal. That is why the amendment would create a unitary authority based on Clackmannan and Stirling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister takes into account what people think. He has been lobbied strongly by representatives from Clackmannan who made a good case for an enabling authority. I also met representatives from Clackmannan who explained to me in no uncertain terms that when considering a partnership, they do not have in mind the kind of enabling authority that might be set up in Kyle and Carrick, when they would look for services to be provided by a third party. That is not how Clackmannan council envisages providing its services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was recently challenged by someone who said that Stirling was not really a Labour authority because, when Labour took control, it did not set up a huge direct labour organisation. However, we examined the services that Stirling council had to provide, which the Government could not provide, and decided that we did not want to extend into a large direct labour organisation. The council always had a good relationship with those who provided capital works for it. I believe that the same applies to Clackmannan. That is the kind of enabling partnership that we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall cite a few more examples and then give way. I do not want to run away from the issue. Yesterday I talked to the leaders and officials of Clackmannan council and they explained the position to me in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council is willing to go out and find a partner, whether that be another council or some other body. For example, many regional caterers have won contracts against the private sector to provide catering. The council is willing to work with the private sector in joint investments to try to boost the area's economy. However, an authority the size of Clackmannan does not have the resources. If forced into an alliance with Falkirk, that joint relationship could be skewed toward the larger district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that Kyle and Carrick could be an enabling council in a different manner. That would be the choice of whichever group or individuals controlled it. He also suggested that that would not be the case with Clackmannan, but surely that would depend on electoral outcomes? It would be difficult for any member of the Committee to forecast which way local authorities will go in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am one of the people who believe that the important matter in Wheatley, which is ignored by the Government and many others, is the statement that there should be a total power of competence given to local government. There should be a devolving of power, which should not be interfered with by the Government. That has drifted over the past 10 or 15 years, which is to be regretted. The people should choose, the council should provide, and the people should judge it. That is fundamental and means that there will be changing patterns of electability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I said during previous sittings of the Committee, after a councillor is elected to a council he should forget the party that put him in power and think about his constituents. Most good councillors do that. It is only when ideology creeps in, as in the Hyekian model of minimalist councils, that the destruction of local government by local government takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman's comments about Clackmannan district council's submission with great interest, but have also read section 9 of Clackmannan's document again. It is headed "The Business Approach" and I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 9.3 on page 16. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council, whilst offering full support to the contractor, will at this stage let the contractor get on with the job of delivering the service."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 9.4 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The decision to use external providers will rest on various factors which will be fully considered, the most pertinent being the relative cost-effectiveness and efficiency of direct service provision."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 9.7 discusses
	<br><blockquote><p>"the private sector regarding efficient management of its property portfolio."</p></blockquote>
I understand that to be a full-blown enabling council. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of enabling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but he should remember that the document was submitted on the premise that there may be a Clackmannan council alone—with 47,000 people—charged with the responsibility of providing all services presently provided at regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a situation, there is no doubt that we would disable it from doing what it might want to do either enter a partnership or provide the service directly. With 47,000 people, there is no chance that the authority could provide directly the service required. There could be a scenario of child psychology services being obtained from Glenrothes, not necessarily from Falkirk or Stirling. With the best will in the world, I do not believe that the services in Glenrothes could be geared up to take account of the needs of a 47,000-person partner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish so that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central can speak. We are coming to the end of the dialogue, so I shall give way for the last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the document was prepared on the basis of the authority being unitary, but the point is that a Labour-controlled council is arguing that it can exist as a unitary Clackmannan district council. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is too small to do so, but the council is arguing against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real problem is that, in desperation at the Government's proposals, the reaction of the people of Clackmannan between man, woman and child was that in no way could Clackmannan fit in with a Falkirk-Clackmannan council. That is totally and utterly alien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The geography should be examined. As the Forth widens, there is no connection across it between the new bridge at Stirling and Kincardine. There is no connection between Kincardine and Falkirk. There is no connection between Kincardine and Alloa in people's perceptions. As the Minister is aware, reaction was against the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sent a letter to the leader of Fife regional council. It is argued that in Fife,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in some cases, we believe that single-tier authorities based on existing districts would have been too small to deliver the full range of local authority services".</p></blockquote>
That argument also stands for Central. An authority of 80,000 is too small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if Clackmannan was freed, as it desperately wants to be, from the unholy and perverted—in local government terms—proposed Clackmannan and Falkirk arrangement, a local authority of only 47,000 would not be allowed to function in the way that we wish it to function. It may be able to function creatively, because it has talented, committed people, but that does not mean that it will be able to succeed in the long term. It will do its best, as all local councils do. But why should we impose such constraints, forcing it to merge with Falkirk or, alternatively to stand alone? Why should Stirling be in a position where a different political hue might mean that it would not wish to provide the services in the way that the Government force it to provide? It is wrong to disable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
such councils. We must not assume, as the hon. Member for Ayr said, that councils will have the same political colour at the next election and the one after. It is important to propose a structure that is sustainable, regardless of a council's political colour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the hon. Gentleman's arguments so I think that I understand his position clearly. He believes that Clackmannan must not be a single unitary authority. Consequently, it must be linked to some other authority. According to the hon. Gentleman, the options are Stirling or Falkirk. His objection to Falkirk is geographic, because the only connection is the bridge which is at present part of Fife. The map shows clearly that the boundaries are simply formed by both sides of the river. As I understand it, the hon.

In conclusion, I tabled the amendment after consulting representatives of a number of councils in Central region, as well as people in Stirling, Clackmannan and Falkirk. I spent the weekend talking to representatives from all parties—all of whom may be chasing their own particular dream. We came up with an amendment that we thought people would be happy with. I have received a letter from Clackmannan district council which has been signed by the council's leader of administration and, more importantly, by my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill). It says that following the evidence of last week, they are happy at the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government's apparent acceptance of additional new unitary authorities within the population range of 100–120,000".</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Both Labour and S.N.P. have tabled an amendment to promote new unitary authorities for Falkirk and Clackmannan/Stirling."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Council, at this stage, would positively consider the establishment of a Stirling/Clackmannan authority even although this was not our first preference."</p></blockquote>
They had to do a great deal of heartsearching in this respect. With the prospect of the Falkirk-Clackmannan authority being forced through, the council mounted a campaign to get people to defend the "wee county". Just as the Wheatley report proposed that there should be no Clackmannan, a defence of the "wee county" was mounted by Lords such as the Earl of Mar to retain it. That was viable for a district, but not viable for a region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a letter from the leaders of all the parties represented on Falkirk district council. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we believe that a Unitary Authority based on the existing boundaries of Stirling and Clackmannan District Councils would be a viable and sensible option".</p></blockquote>
It is very important that Falkirk would be happy with the sensible option of Clackmannan and Stirling. Clackmannan is also happy for that option to be accepted.

If the Government are not willing to accept an authority that is totally enabled, and not disabled—that is, a unitary authority on a regional basis—they must go on to the next stage. They must at least provide two authorities that are capable of getting into adequate partnerships and providing the services that the Bill is supposed to safeguard. Regardless of anything else it does, the Bill must safeguard our ability to have authorities that will provide adequately. I hope that the Minister is listening and will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to rise to support amendments Nos. 30 and 38 which concern Kincardine on Forth. Kincardine is an area that will be known to Scottish Conservatives—it may also be known to English Members. It is a community of just over 3,000 people, tucked away in the western corner of Fife covering what is known as Tulhallan parish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kincardine will never host the World cup; it will never host a winter Olympics and it will not be a venue for international conferences. Today, mercifully, it takes centre stage in Committee to highlight two things. First, I want to highlight the absolute absurdity of the Government proposal to take Kincardine out of the Kingdom of Fife. It has been in Fife for more than 100 years. What is the Government's case for their proposal? Secondly, I want to highlight the anger of a community. The Government often say that we should listen to the people. I sincerely hope that many Conservative Members will want not to support the Opposition, not to support the SNP the Labour party or the Liberals, but to think carefully about what we are doing to a valuable community in the Kingdom of Fife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interesting thing about Kincardine bridge is that when there were only ferries across the Forth it was the only bridge that road traffic could use. Those of us who are old enough remember quite clearly the journey along the the side of the Forth and across Kincardine bridge to get north. One always assumed that Kincardine bridge was the link between the south and north banks of the Forth. It is not unrealistic to recognise that, because it has existed for a long, long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. I would encourage him to take a more active interest in this issue. He has said previously that he is a man of independent mind. This issue is not about the politics of Fife. It is simply about a community that has stated its interest in remaining in Fife. That is its bottom line, which is reasonable and common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The waters have been muddied by the Government's intentions. In a sense, the robbery that would take place if Fife lost Kincardine would be done for one purpose: to make sense of the Government's carve-up of Central region, the logic is there for all to see. First, there was the political prize of Stirling being plucked out of Central to become a single-tier authority. Secondly, there is the problem of the remaining two districts, Falkirk and Clackmannan. The map shows an estuarial crossing, but there are no links. The answer, whether it comes from the Scottish Office or Conservative headquarters is "Let's take Kincardine—the road link—out of Fife so that these two districts with no link can be contiguous." Is it as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
barefaced as that? I do not know. Perhaps the Minister will say that I am too cynical but I do not believe that I am. It is cynical, however, to seek to use a community of more than 3,000 people to promote a Government carve-up of another region. That is crazy. It is simply ridiculous and shows contempt for the people of Kincardine. I hope that Conservative Members will bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered the negative side of the issue. The people of Kincardine want to continue to enjoy the services provided by Fife. Ministers often describe Fife as a flagship authority. It provides some of the best services in the country. Kincardine has a significant elderly population and it enjoys some of the best services obtained from council tax payments. If we put to one side the negative issue of the carve up of Central, however, and the need for Kincardine to be included in the new authority to make sense of it, we should also accept the positive arguments for Kincardine to stay in Fife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Well over 100 years of history link Kincardine with the Kingdom of Fife, which is a well-run region providing valuable services to all parts of the kingdom. The community wants to stay with Fife so that it can enjoy the benefits of geography, history and quality services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community has been consulted and asked for its views, and it is clear that the overwhelming majority of residents want to remain part of Fife. If the Government do not accept the amendments, they will be flying in the face of public opinion. Surely, that opinion is vital. This is not the most important issue in the Bill nor the biggest problem regarding boundaries, but it is critical that the people of Kincardine have some faith in the legislature and in the people that they send here to legislate on their behalf. The community has said loudly and clearly that it wants to remain in Fife. That view should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is more practical—the quality of services in Kincardine. The Minister will accept that Fife provides excellent services. I have already referred to the elderly community so I shall quote from Mr. Hepburn, who is the secretary and treasurer of Kincardine Old Peoples Welfare. As it is the day following Valentine's day, I shall quote the little poem that he penned. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Gateway to the Kingdom of Fife,
<br><br><!-- lb --> Where Senior Citizens enjoy a good life.
<br><br><!-- lb --> To many this reform bill
<br><br><!-- lb --> is not a sweet, but bitter pill.
<br><br><!-- lb --> To many this has caused lots of stress,
<br><br><!-- lb --> I have not found any who could not care less."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Hepburn adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We may pay slightly higher taxes than other regions, but one only gets what one pays for and the Senior Citizens of this community feel that they receive the best from Fife Regional Council."</p></blockquote>
He concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Trusting the committee will listen to our plea and treat it with the respect it deserves."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that his views will be treated with respect. That means accepting our amendments, so that Kincardine receives what it wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that Dunfermline district council would like to set up a unitary authority as opposed to a Fife regional one. Does the hon. Gentleman think that Kincardine has the same affinity for Dunfermline and west Fife as it has for Fife as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is Kincardine. We will deal later with the hon. Gentleman's attempt to split Fife, but that is not germane now. The fact is that Kincardine wants to remain in Fife. No number of red herrings can take away from that. I shall be happy to debate the proposal that the hon. Gentleman and Dunfermline district council have worked out at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politics and politicians are often not held in high regard. One of the benefits of a Committee discussion of an issue is that it provides the opportunity to try to reinforce the faith of the electorate in what we do in this place. On Friday, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West and I went to Kincardine and received a petition in the shape of a Valentine's card bearing more than 800 signatures. This morning a delegation has come to the House from Fife; it is also fighting to keep the local community together. Of course we have the opportunity this morning to make a decision on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to argue this morning objectively that the community only wants us to listen. An attempt is being made to confront the nonsense of the proposal with sheer common sense. If the Government fail to accept the amendments they will be treating Kincardine with the utmost cynicism and the people with the utmost contempt. If that is not what Conservative Members wish, they should support the amendments and ensure that the people of Kincardine get what they want. If democracy is not about that, I simply do not know what arguments we can put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remarks are interesting and fascinating. If I understand him correctly, he is suggesting that only on the Government Benches should such democratic freedom be exercised. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), who has always spoken out clearly for what he believes—whether one accepts it is another matter—is an honourable exception on the Opposition Benches and represents my view of functioning democracy. When the hon. Member for Fife, Central emulates his hon. Friend, perhaps he will persuade me to follow him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Tayside, North would be generous in his remarks, but they finished with a nasty sting in the tail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends have accepted the common-sense wisdom of the point that is being made. I was not attacking the Government for lack of interest in the sense of community or democracy. I am directly appealing to Conservative Members—if they need to be persuaded. This is an issue on which they can show independence of mind and show that they care more about people than about the absurdity of stealing Kincardine to shore up the Government's carve-up of another region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may ask one crisp question which, yet again, relates to property. Do the Government's proposals reflect both new and existing property needs and the facilities that are available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday 14 February, in reply to my question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"what venues he has in mind outside the City of Aberdeen as headquarters of the proposed new Aberdeenshire Council"</p></blockquote>
the Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall reply to the hon. Member as soon as possible."</p></blockquote>
The Government have obviously not considered the cost consequences of their proposals for Aberdeenshire. That was confirmed to me by Richard Blackburn, the chief executive of Banff and Buchan district council who wrote on 9 February:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am able to confirm that there is no administrative headquarters within the proposed Aberdeenshire area, now intended to include the Mearns, which would be large enough to serve as a headquarters. The obvious headquarters for Aberdeenshire is Woodhill House, which is in the city of Aberdeen boundary and currently serves as Grampian region headquarters. There is every indication that the new Aberdeen city authority intends to have its headquarters in the historic town house in Aberdeen, leaving Woodhill House for the rural area."</p></blockquote>
I refer to that because, plainly, given what we discussed last week no conclusion has been reached. My question is crisp and simple: what are the property consequences of what the Government propose? I do not know the answer, frankly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous incarnation, when I was Member of Parliament for Bo'ness, I had much to do with Viewforth in Stirling. It is a massive facility and one wonders what will happen to it under the current proposals? For example, is it intended to have central administrative offices in Falkirk? We are told that they would be extremely expensive, costing between £12 million and £15 million. It is an interrogative question. I do not know the answer. I hope that the Minister will answer that question when he replies to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Fife, Central about treating the issues on their merits. If they are so treated, the situation clarifies itself and so does the solution. I support his remarks about Kincardine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak to my amendments Nos. 120 and 126 and to express my support for amendment No. 109, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
which I have added my name along with those of other hon. Members. The amendments are designed to confirm Falkirk as a new unitary authority and to link together Stirling district and Clackmannan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, some of the boundaries have been easy to spot and have offered distinct and straightforward solutions. In Central region, there are more closely competing alternatives. I share some common background with the hon. Member for Falkirk, East in our service on Stirling district council. I acknowledge his detailed and expert analysis of the local scene. As will be seen from the amendments, we have reached almost the same conclusion from different routes. That is because of the fundamental reality of the communities, economies and social ties in the Central area of Scotland. His appeal for a sensible and more balanced solution lies at the heart of the matter. I appeal to the Government for such a solution and for them to abandon their present unworkable proposition. The Government's proposals are opposed locally, almost uniformly. I hope that the Government will take up the balanced solution offered to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central region has much to be proud of in its achievements in the past 20 years. As regions go, it is a reasonable size and could create a heart-of-Scotland identity. I say "could" because it has not yet done so. It has, however, established more than reasonable credentials since its foundation. Credit should be given where credit is due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like Clackmannan to continue, ideally, as an autonomous local government unit. It has a long and honourable history. It is very much a community and is identified as such. Unfortunately, in modern day terms, it is too small on its own, but simply tacking on other bits of areas is an inadequate and unsound proposition for its future. It would be unacceptable if little bits were tacked on to Clackmannan for those reasons. I want Clackmannan to continue as an identifiable entity because of its history and what it means to the local population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal to tag Clackmannan on to Falkirk is unviable, unfair and massively opposed by local people. Clackmannan would simply be swamped by the much larger Falkirk council and be reduced to a remote outpost, physically separated by the River Forth and dominated by its neighbour. I do not want that to happen; Clackmannan does not deserve it. The proposal to tag on a bit of Fife is just plain daft and I hope that the Government will not contemplate doing that. It is unfair to Kincardine and Clackmannan to treat them in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no community, economic, historical, service or direct public transport links between Clackmannan and Falkirk. That is at the heart of this issue. Clackmannan's natural orientation is toward Stirling, not Falkirk as the Government propose. By contrast, there are well-developed economic, transport and social links between the contiguous authorities of Clackmannan and Stirling. I am told that 75 per cent. of Clackmannan residents who work outside their district work in Stirling; 83 per cent. of the personal and household expenditure that leaves Clackmannan district goes not to Falkirk, but to Stirling district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
A Clackmannan-Stirling authority would consist of two continguous areas, whereas the proposed Clackmannan-Falkirk authority would be physically separate, disproportionately sized and would have to have a bit of Fife as a bridgehead. For health and education provision, travel patterns and many other services, Clackmannan looks to Stirling district rather than to Falkirk. It is for those practical reasons that that solution presents itself. I should prefer Clackmannan to continue as an authority in its own right, but, if that is not to be, a link-up with Stirling district would be a better balanced and more viable proposition for all the communities involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Falkirk has one of the strongest cases for continuing as a unitary authority, and that proposition has the overwhelming support of its population. Falkirk district is economically strong and has a sound financial record of which it can justifiably be proud. It has a clear community identity with well-defined natural boundaries and is the ninth largest district in Scotland in population terms. It can offer well-established existing offices, management structures and services. It has the potential of being one of the strongest new authorities in Scotland. I hope that the Government will listen to that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the question of the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I know that, because of the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the proposed local government changes, he has pursued—in his typically relentless fashion—the problems of accommodation and property. Falkirk district council is well furnished with operational buildings for the services that it would have to provide if it became a unitary authority. It is confident that within the existing district boundaries there is adequate potential to rent, lease or buy accommodation for the management and support staff required to take over regional services. That can come from private or
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
commercial developments or from space vacated by public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow will be interested to know that Falkirk has informed me that new-build offices will not be considered because of timetables and cost. Information technology is a particular interest of his. I share his anxiety about how important it is that the transfer of information technology, on which local authorities are now so dependent, is smoothly managed in Falkirk district, should it be the new unitary authority. Falkirk has carefully examined the situation and it has been concluded that a link could easily be established with the regional council's mainframe computer systems which, in the first instance, would be utilised until such time as the new unitary authority has established an information technology strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right that the Committee addresses the matter of information technology and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. Is he opposed to the region remaining as the unitary authority, even though the regional council has made a case for its retention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that credit should be given where it is due. Central region has performed well and should be praised for its work over the past 20 years, but the logic of the situation leads me to support Falkirk as a unitary authority. Because Clackmannan would be too small, given the extra responsibilities placed on it, it could survive but, sadly, it would be stretched in resources; when Clackmannan—which naturally looks to Stirling—joined Stirling, Stirling and Clackmannan district would be allowed to continue services at the lower level in the best interests of its people. The matter of Central region is not as clear cut as many others, but the logic of the situation has led me to my conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was responding in detail to the usual apposite points made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow about property. I hope that he is satisfied about the matter and also about information technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Falkirk district council places great importance on aiming its service objectives at community needs, which is a strong plus as the new councils prepare to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a genuinely interrogatory question. I have not leapt to conclusions. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that before people come up with costings, they should be clear about how the needs of one authority mirror those of a proposed authority? In Aberdeenshire that has obviously not worked out. It may be true that in Falkirk it is adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with the hon. Member for Linlithgow, who has great wisdom and experience in these matters. He went to the heart of the problem. Property and accommodation are major difficulties. Focal points for the new authorities must be found if they are to do their work properly. The hon. Gentleman has hit a problem about Aberdeenshire. I hope that the Government will address it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I back Falkirk district council as a unitary authority for the reasons that I have stated and because it has well-established offices, management structures and services. It has the potential to be one of the strongest new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
authorities. Falkirk, on its record, has a strong case on merit for unitary status. I hope that the Government will reject their unworkable proposal and adopt a sensible strategy based on existing communities and historic local government units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best configuration for Central region is a Falkirk authority and a Stirling and Clackmannan authority. I hope that the Government are listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make a contribution to the debate. I have listened carefully to the arguments and I am very impressed by the case put by the hon. Member for Fife, Central regarding Kincardine. The Committee must pay particular attention to communities which do not have the muscle or the influence of the bigger authorities. The cases made by the bigger authorities and by the regional and district council have been backed by professional advisers. Many have done a very good job. Some have gone too far in financing some of the cases, however, and have produced glossy publications. Therefore, it is especially important that the Committee pays particular regard to small communities that are, in that sense, defenceless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in sympathy with what the hon. Member is saying. He would also realise that Stirling must have a view on this. As is often the case when there is a constituency interest, the hon. Member whose constituency is most affected is not necessarily a member of the Committee. If we are to talk about this, as we must, we should also take on board the interests of Stirling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stray into the merits of the case. I freely confess that I am not an expert. I do not have an axe to grind. That perhaps strengthens the case that I make for Kincardine, because I do so objectively. What came across very clearly in the submission made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central is that Kincardine is a small community of 3,000 souls. It is an important and historic community. As the hon. Member for Tayside, North pointed out, it provided the link when the old bridge was the only route north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore particularly important that the Committee pays attention to Kincardine's needs. Nobody else will look after its interests. It does not have the finances that some of the bigger authorities used to argue their case with the help of professional consultants. The Government have a duty to explain why they are sacrificing this community. That is what they seem to be doing. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East made a powerful case when moving amendment No. 25 and I was impressed by his argument Even more important, however, is the explanation that the Minister will give for his proposal relating to the village of Kincardine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before calling the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) I wish to respond to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East about the marshalling of amendments. I described it at the time as an important point of order
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
and, having considered it, I still think it important. I fully understand the hon. Member's position as the constituency Member. The rule, however, is as follows: when several amendments are offered to the same place, precedence is given to an amendment to leave out words and insert others, over one which merely leaves out words. Amendment No. 120 leaves out and inserts words, so it takes precedence over amendment No. 109 which merely leave out words. By raising that important point of order, the hon. Gentleman will have put the exact position on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will do things differently in the Scottish Parliament. I want to return briefly to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central about Kincardine. Parallels exist between this debate and our debate last Thursday. Both arise out of the Government's difficulties in putting together districts that do not fit into their scheme of things. Up until last week we assumed that the Government's top priority in the south-east of Scotland was to create a Berwickshire and East Lothian local authority. As a consequence, Midlothian and West Lothian were going spare. The Government wanted to lump them together, they could not find a way of bridging them because Balerno was the gap, and they did not dare raid the constituency of the Secretary of State for Defence. So it was left as a detached proposed new local authority. We had a sensible debate about that last week and, happily, the idea has been scrapped, so we now have West Lothian and eastern Midlothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North of Fife there is a different pattern. We understand that the Government were determined to create a single-purpose Stirling district authority, come hell or high water, which left Clackmannan and Falkirk going spare. There was still a gap to bridge. There was a bridge, but it went to Fife. The Government thought that they could get away with raiding the Kingdom of Fife and taking Kincardine away from it. The case is as strong in the area that we are debating today as it was last week. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central spoke of the very strong feelings of the people of Kincardine. The Government should not simply leapfrog around Scotland, taking little bits out of one area and putting them into another because it suits their political agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the way in which the Minister addressed the problem in Lothian. We have made some progress, and we shall debate the issue further with him. I hope that he will approach the amendments in the same spirit. I am not qualified to speak in detail the situation in Central region, but I have been impressed by the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East. It seems that, once again, there is an alternative—that is, to combine Clackmannan with Stirling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East suggested that Clackmannan, with its population of 47,000, should stand alone. We must consider whether very small district authorities are in the interests of the good government of Scotland and of the localities concerned. Would a district with a population of 47,000 souls have the scale and resources required for good government? Frankly, I doubt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise a narrow point concerning good administartion, and I should be grateful for the Minister's response. Clackmannan district council has 12 elected
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
members. Therefore, we could have an all-purpose authority with as few as 12 elected members. In certain circumstances, there might be a controlling group of just seven members. In addition to a convenor, there would have to be chairmen responsible for finance, social work, planning, education, transport and roads, housing and environmental services. What kind of work load would that mean for local councillors? Is it a credible proposal? I suspect that the conclusion that we must draw is that local authorities on that scale cannot provide efficient administration and services, or credible democratic administration. We should be considering a sensible alternative—which is what we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Are Labour members of the Committee aware of the views of the hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill)? If so, perhaps they could tell us what they are, as it would be of great interest to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise one issue regarding the practicality of the Government's proposals for splitting Central region. In principle, I believe that the region should remain as it is, however, given that a Division has been proposed, I want to speak about Catholic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, under the Government's scheme, St. Modan's high school in Stirling would lose three of its feeder primaries and 60 per cent. of its intake. I understand that, because Falkirk has St. Mungo's, there is no question of the rights of Catholic parents under the Education (Scotland) Act 1918 being lost. However, there is an issue about whether St. Modan's would remain a viable school if it lost 60 per cent. of its intake. There is also the question of whether there would be substantial overcrowding in St. Mungo's or whether additional capital expenditure would be required if substantial numbers of children moved. Would the children involved face substantial additional travelling time? It is important that the Government tell us how the proposed division will operate in practice and how it will affect Catholic education. They have said that it will be possible for the existing pattern to remain if, under the parents charter, parents choose to send their children to schools under the same lines as the existing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under those arrangements, parents will not receive free travel. Therefore, if 60 per cent. of the intake remain with St. Modan's, Catholic parents will effectively be fined the travel costs. That is inappropriate. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East has received correspondence from Archbishop O'Brien, which he has kindly forwarded to the rest of the Committee, which has raised that very issue. The Government should tell us how they will deal with the problem. We are being asked to accept the break-up of Central region and buy a pig in a poke without receiving any clarification. I hope that the Minister can give me a full and satisfactory answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a serious and well-informed debate, on an area of reorganisation on which there is not a single, generally acceptable answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four options have been put to the Committee. First, and proposed by Central regional council in particular, is the option for a single-tier Central region. Secondly, at the other end of the spectrum, the three district councils
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
involved have separately made their views known. Stirling district council put forward a well-considered case for a unitary authority based on Stirling; Falkirk district council, as we have heard from the hon. Member for Falkirk, East and from the submissions received by hon. Members yesterday or this morning, put forward the case for Falkirk to be a unitary authority on its own. Clackmannan council put forward a strong case for it to be a unitary authority, although that case has been queried by Labour Members on the grounds of its population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between those two options fall two intermediate ones. The Government's option is for a single Stirling authority and a combined Falkirk and Clackmannan authority. Then, there is the fallback option—and I do not use that term in a pejorative sense. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East was perfectly entitled to put his first and second choices to the Committee. The fallback option, as encapsulated in the amendments, is for a single Falkirk authority and a combined Clackmannan and Stirling authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has brought into sharp focus the strong bodies of opinion on the various alternatives. Hon. Members have referred to the delegations that I have seen. The hon. Members for Falkirk, East and for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) met me with a delegation from Central regional council. They put forward a strong case and went into the costs in some detail. Their views were in contrast to those expressed by the delegation from the constituency of the hon. Member for Clackmannan, which argued strongly for unitary status for that wee county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that this is an issue on which reasonable people across the political parties can take a different view. In many cases, the submissions received by the Government have been all-party ones. There is conflicting evidence and there are conflicting arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central is arguably the classic case, which raises the question whether big is beautiful, particularly in relation to service delivery and costs. The hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to the Wheatley commission in this regard. I shall return to the point about the estuarial principle, but that principle, on which Wheatley based the original concept of the small number of very large regions is not now generally accepted and it was not accepted at the time of the report. Some of the commission's points, particularly about education and the minimum necessary size for an education authority, are not now accepted—certainly not by the Government. That is evidenced by the good educational results of some of the smaller education authorities in north and south Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other argument is whether small is beautiful for the reflection of local loyalties and common characteristics without compromising service delivery. Both Stirling and Clackmannan districts have argued strongly that with an enabling approach linked to partnerships with other agencies, there is no reason why small authorities should not be able to deliver high quality services to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an interesting debate about Clackmannan and what is meant there by the term "enabling authority", as opposed to what is meant in Kyle and Carrick in Ayrshire. It is clear that in both cases the same general terms are used. I do not believe that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
is correct to imply that Clackmannan's proposal for a single-tier authority is a defensive, desperate strategy. That was the broad conclusion of Clackmannan's proposals in response to the second consultation document, before the Government's detailed proposals were published. That publicly available document contained the argument that Clackmannan district council had demonstrated that a small authority can fund large capital projects and be a key partner providing crucial leverage and initiative for those.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to give the impression that it was driven by a wish that "a unitary Clackmannan should be the primary interest that the authority took the action that it did, rather than just as a reaction to the threat of the Falkirk-Clackmannan proposal. I have a letter from the council leader, Councillor Rab Elder, to the leader of the Labour group in Stirling district, asking where it stands. The letter states clearly that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Clackmannan people would be happy to have a Stirling/Clackmannan unitary authority … but up to the present time we do not know how you, as Stirling Labour Group, stand."</p></blockquote>
Clearly Clackmannan would prefer a unitary authority based on Clackmannan and Stirling and it has sought support for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter was given to me to emphasise the fact that Clackmannan acted in reaction to a proposal to force it into an unacceptable alliance with Falkirk. The Minister must accept that I hope that he also accepts that Councillor Elder, whose letter I read earlier, and the hon. Member for Clackmannan share the same view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the letter that the hon. Gentleman read out and, as I understood it it was clear. Unless Clackmannan district council has, since I met its representatives, changed its stance, which was clear and argued with great enthusiasm, its first preference is for a Clackmannan unitary authority. Failing that the second preference was, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, a link-up with Stirling. I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was in the context of seeking to reconcile often diametrically opposed arguments that we concluded that on balance there should be two separate authorities for Central; one based on Stirling district and the other based on Clackmannan and Falkirk districts. We took the view that Clackmannan and Falkirk were both relatively compact and heavily industrialised. That contrasted sharply with Stirling which is more of a service centre with a large rural hinterland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other factors influenced us, such as the sense of rivalry between Stirling and Falkirk. I do not criticise Central for the work which the elected councillors and members have done. Indeed, I have worked closely with them on the Stirling initiative, but it has not captured the popular imagination. That is confirmed in the submission—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Clackmannan and Falkirk are to be the answer does that not leave Clackmannan physically isolated and in danger of being swamped by the vast area and population of Falkirk? Does such a solution, rather than the more sensible Clackmannan and Stirling configuration, not simply lead to the isolation of Clackmannan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman does not have an argument I am trying to set out the kind of considerations that we took into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive my curiosity but the Minister says that Central region has not captured the imagination. Could he name the councils which, in his opinion, have captured the imagination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is tempting me to make myself extremely unpopular—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—even more unpopular. I did not say that as a criticism of much of the work of Central regional council. But the all-party submission from Falkirk district council says that the Central regional council is too remote and does not meet the principle of local democratic accountability and accessability. That is not my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened carefully to the lobbies, and all those that I have spoken to have said that Central is remote and has not been sympathetic and has not understood the views of the people. That was put to me by representatives of the three district councils who had different political views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct to refer to that. As I happen to have the Falkirk submission in front of me, it is worth putting on the record that Falkirk district council—which I accept is only one source of popular opinion—says that Central is not a cohesive unit with a community identity and is not popular with the general public in its area. That is the view of Falkirk district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wouldn't it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Undoubtedly Central regional council can point to other evidence to the effect that it is appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For many years when I represented Bo'ness I was a Member of Parliament for part of Central region. I should like to place on the record the considerable kindness and efficiency that I found in almost all the officials of Central region. I should like to place on the record the excellent work of the then convenor councillor Charles Sheddon of Bo'ness and of officials such as Ian Collie and Frank Bracewell. It is a slur on Central region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said two or three times that I am not attacking the work of Central regional council. 	<i>Hansard</i> will record the tribute I paid a few minutes ago to the work of the elected councillors and office bearers of Central regional council in relation, for example, to the Stirling initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we put on the record the representations that were received as recently as last night and this morning. They make the point that I made earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. It is reasonable for the Committee to refer to representations that it has received from different authorities and to comment upon them objectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) asked about education. He raised similar issues about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
Helensburgh and he received a reply from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for education. No doubt, we shall return to that matter when we reach clause 32.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised the matter today because the answer that I received from the Minister at a previous sitting was completely unsatisfactory. I want further clarification and, I hope, a satisfactory answer. To refer me back to an earlier answer, which was not good enough, is not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's dissatisfaction will be explored at length when we reach clause 32.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that there is anything that I can add to help him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central spoke about Kincardine. I refer him back to the Wheatley commission, which he constantly quotes with admiration. Appendix 19 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The electoral division of Kincardine which lies on the main route between Falkirk and Alloa via the Kincardine Bridge is also included because it is more closely linked with the Falkirk-Grangemouth and Alloa areas than with the rest of Fife."</p></blockquote>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about local opinion in Kincardine. However, it is not reasonable to suggest that there is no possible case for the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to tell the hon. Gentleman. First, I refer him to the Wheatley commission. I do not suggest that its view is decisive because the Government of the day did not follow that recommendation, but Wheatley reflected a serious body of opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not accept the point, which was also made in passing by the hon. Member for Ayr, that 20 years on the pattern of life and travel is remarkably different in that area? Fife has existed for 20 years, but Kincardine has changed markedly. All the evidence presented about Kincardine suggests that there is little traffic, few house purchases and little travelling to work between Kincardine and Falkirk. The Minister should accept that things have changed after 20 years. One thing that has changed is that Kincardine is solidly in Fife and has no relationship with Falkirk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not denying and did not seek to deny that things can change in 20 years. Clearly, it would be absurd to do that. Labour Members have rightly quoted Wheatley, so it is not unreasonable for me to do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to justify the decision to take Kincardine out of Fife on the basis of the Wheatley commission's recommendations. When we discussed Monifieth and Dundee, the Minister justified overturning the Wheatley commission's recommendation that Monifieth should be in Dundee because local opinion in Monifieth wanted it to become part of Angus and Mearns. He is now arguing exactly the
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
opposite about Kincardine. Local opinion wants Kincardine to stay in Fife, but the Minister is saying that we should overturn that view and respect the Wheatley recommendation that it should become part of the new Clackmannan and Falkirk council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that the leader of his party at the time disagreed with the Wheatley recommendation and voted for taking Monifieth out of Dundee. I did not suggest that the views of the Wheatley commission are decisive. That would be absurd. However, it is not unreasonable to give the exact position of the Wheatley commission. I said that we believed that there are strong practical reasons for including Kincardine in the new Clackmannan and Falkirk authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The road link via the Kincardine bridge links Kincardine with Falkirk and Clackmannan. The new authority can deliver high quality services to its citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister finishes, will he deal with the question of property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question was dealt with by the hon. Member for Angus, East. The location of their headquarters will be a matter for the new authorities. Falkirk district council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is no truth in Central Regional Council's assertion that a Falkirk Council would have to spend £12m on a new office development. Falkirk District Council is well furnished with operational buildings and the Council is confident that there is adequate potential to provide sufficient accommodation for management and support staff without the need for large new-build offices."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister have in mind for Viewforth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows the rules of Committees far better than any other member of this Committee. He must ask the Minister to give way before he starts speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way? The question of Viewforth is a very awkward one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not give way. I have answered the hon. Gentleman in great detail, as did the hon. Member for Angus, East when the point was put to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall sum up by accepting that there are conflicting views and considerations regarding this area of Scotland. I cannot recommend the Opposition's amendments. However, I can tell the Committee that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I shall reflect on the points that hon. Members have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remarks need to be clarified. He says that he will do something in future, but gives no idea of the direction in which he will go. Given our arguments, he owes us and the people who have come here today to speak to him and to make submissions something more. I do not think that his mind can have been changed by the submissions he has received in the past few hours, so I presume that he has been thinking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
about the matter for some time. If he gives us an idea of the direction in which he will go, that will give us an idea whether we shall have to press these issues to divisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the Minister's ideas for the future of the Viewforth property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East. We want clarification of what the Minister said and welcome the admission that the area is a part of Scotland in which there are conflicting views about the shape of the map. That includes the point about Kincardine. If there is acceptance of that on both sides, a way forward for dialogue would be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister envisage taking place during his discussions with the Secretary of State? Will they involve a rigorous dialogue with the parties involved in the debate, including Fife, because it is germane to Kincardine? If so, will he assure us that he will again discuss these matters with the Opposition in relation to points made this morning?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can members of the Committee take it from the Minister's comments that nothing further will be decided by the Government until such steps have been taken and that the matter can be examined on Report? I understand that the Minister is in difficulty and am not asking for assurances that he cannot give, but it would be reasonably satisfactory to conclude the debate with the Minister listening to us and anxious because of the representations that have been made. We would be grateful if he would comment further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government reflection without action is not good enough. If there is unanimity, it is unanimity against the Government's proposals. Reasonable alternatives have been suggested and I support the hon. Member for Fife, Central. The Minister should say exactly what he means by dialogue and reflection, and how far—if at all—he is prepared to move. If he is not prepared to move, the proposals are unacceptable. Will the Minister clarify what he has in mind and with whom the dialogue will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's contribution was disappointing. I listened to him carefully and he seemed to say that there is no alternative to the Government's scheme and, therefore, the game is up. He did not put forward a positive case for his proposal. There is no identifiable body of opinion that supports the Government's view. Their case is demonstrably lacking. The Minister was substantially remiss in not being much more positive about why the Government came up with such a strange proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are differences of view in different areas, but that does not detract from the onus being clearly on the Government to put a positive case. That was lamentably lacking. The Minister has put the Committee in a difficult position about the further stages of the Bill's consideration. A substantial group of amendments has been exhaustively debated and Opposition Members do not know whether they have a chance of a debate on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very well for the Minister to say that he will table amendments at a later stage—(a), (b), (c) or (d)—and
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
acceptable for the Government to say that they have presented a positive case and state where they stand. However, the Minister has done neither. He has said that the Government will think further about the matter, which leaves the Opposition high and dry and in a hiatus. We do not know what steps to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes the Committee further clarification before the end of the sitting. What does he expect opposition members of the Committee, lobby groups and council representatives to do in the short-term to concentrate the Government's mind? I am no clearer about what the Government intend to do, despite having listened to the minister for about 30 minutes. That is lamentable and disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has considered serious and important matters. One problem is that some representations have arrived rather late—last night and this morning, for example. Because of the conflicting views given, we would be wrong to make rapid decisions in voting on the amendment when we are still uncertain of the consensus in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that people realise that most of the submissions have been made in different forms before being presented to the Committee today. Some hon. Members did not know that they would be selected to serve on the Committee until its members were chosen. Therefore, representatives of certain authorities did not know to whom they should address their material. That is why some submissions have been received late. However, the Minister has had many of them for some time. The only difference is that in Committee, the Minister suggested that a certain size of authority was acceptable, and he began to make concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are not lacking in consensus. The amendments on the Clackmannan and Stirling axis are supported by people throughout the region. Some people may want to hang on to the idea of a larger authority, but they concede that it may not be possible, so they support the smaller authority. Others have said that if they were forced to choose, they would support the proposal that Clackmannan should stand alone as a very small authority rather than the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a compromise: some people will have to give up their vision of a large authority covering the whole of central Scotland, and others must accept that they will have to make an alliance across boundaries with another district council, with whom they must form a new relationship. That is a significant step forward. The Minister has been aware of how matters stand since last Thursday. He should have moved much further forward than he has. We should have an idea where his thought processes are leading him. Are we being asked to give up all the good work that has been done over the past three or four days—especially today—and let the Minister freewheel it so that he can come back with the same proposal on Report? That is not satisfactory, and I am sure that the Minister knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make clear my dissatisfaction with the Minister's response to my question on Catholic education. In referring me to the position in Helensburgh, he seemed to have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
misunderstood the point completely. In Helensburgh, there is a Catholic secondary school in Dumbarton but not in Argyll. There will be Catholic secondary school provisions in Central region. My questions were about the distances that will be travelled to school and whether fares for such travel will be paid. The Minister gave us no answer on those matters. I understand that it is not his direct responsibility, but the question requires an answer. They have been the subject of submission and correspondence for some months. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East raised the point intitially. Both he and I are entitled to a response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked about consultations. That was a perfectly reasonable request. A range of arguments has been put to the Committee. How hon. Members vote is entirely up to them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us an assurance about the dialogue that we all need. It would be a courtesy to the Committee if, at the conclusion of those general debates, we could have further discussions. There is a clear understanding that the debate has moved forward today. Complex issues have been raised; there is much difference of opinion about where boundaries should be, and a genuine lack of consensus. On the basis of the Minister's assurances, and in the hope that he will honour the commitments that have been made—as I have no doubt he will—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That time may be constrained by a timetable motion which may embrace Report stage. If the Government—because of circumstances beyond their control in terms of time—find that they cannot guarantee time further to discuss the matter on Report, the Committee is in a difficulty. We should have to resort to amendments in the House of Lords, which would be profoundly unsatisfactory. The Government must undertake to use their good offices to find time to deal with the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already spoken for some time, my speech will be short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) is aware of the approach that the district council has made to me and is certainly aware of my involvement in this proposal. My views on local government are well known. I have spoken about structures with which people must identify, for which councillors must be seen to be accountable, and about which individual electors feel happy. In all respects, this suggestion for Clydesdale falls into that category. I do not consider that I need to expand on those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for Clydesdale was put by Clydesdale district council in referendum form to the people of that area. Some 42,000 ballot papers, so to speak, were issued and there was a 62 per cent. response. That ballot favoured a single Clydesdale unitary authority. I understand that there are 24 community councils in the Clydesdale area, and 23 of them applauded and accepted the drive towards a unitary Clydesdale authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make progress and to be brief. I understand that one community council, Leadhills, stood back, and that it favours Dumfries. As well as the people and the community councils, the business sector seems to favour the Clydesdale unitary authority. A group called Target Clydesdale, which is chaired by the chairman of Clydesdale Development company, who is a member of the Lanarkshire development agency, has come out in particular support of that suggestion. The group says that Clydesdale covers over half the landward area of the old county of Lanarkshire. It has a population of 58,650. That is seen by many as a weakness in the argument, but other aspects should be taken into account. The size of the population in south Lanarkshire represents
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
18.5 per cent. of the total population of 317,000. The rural area should be taken into account, with its 800 farms. There is real concern that the voices in the rural areas will be lost. The proposed south Lanarkshire authority would be comprised mainly of urban and industrialised areas and a principle concern expressed by the people of Clydesdale is that their voices and interests could well be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three specific areas must be considered when the proposal is scrutinised. First, there is a perceived lack of support for a south Lanarkshire council, from the local area. Various cocktails of other options have been offered in the south Lanarkshire area. I am somewhat surprised that none of those appears to have been put in an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must examine Clydesdale council's ability to deliver all local government services efficiently and effectively. Hon. Members have had recourse to the case presented by Clydesdale demonstrating just that. It acknowledges that there are only four secondary schools in the area, but points to the example of Strathclyde, which has adopted policies of devolving management to local schools. It sees in that the potential for a future education service run by Clydesdale local authority. For that reason I consider that the proposal falls largely into line with Government thinking on the devolved role of schools in their educational management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the services that would be required for what I acknowledge would be a relatively small local authority, we can perceive further convergence with Government policy. Clydesdale sees itself as both an enabling and a purchasing authority. To that end it will be able to draw upon reasonable pools of expertise from the surrounding areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clydesdale points out that it has a well-managed and organised housing structure. It claims that for many years it has regretted the lack of social work provision. It could benefit greatly if its wish was granted. Clydesdale district council has already earned a reputation throughout Scotland for its approach to the management of its services. It is regularly quoted by the Accounts Commission as an example of best practice and value for money. Although a unitary Clydesdale council would not, of course, be the same authority, there is reasonable expectation that it would adopt the management style and methods of the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cost-effectiveness is the third element that I referred to in my opening remarks. Clydesdale certainly has a reputation for good value. Hon. Members should look at the policy and financial plan document which it put forward for 1995–96 where they will see good evidence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council's paper suggests that savings are to be made in the transition from the present dual authority to the single unitary authority. It envisages that £1.5 million a year could be saved. It sees additional savings from Hamilton and East Kilbride councils of some £4.25 million a year. That is very much in line with Government forecasts. On the basis of service provision, identity with the people and cost effectiveness I suggest to my hon. Friend that Clydesdale has put up a good case. I ask him to take those points on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity of saying a few words and I know that I can speak on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale. Many people in Scotland are surprised that only one member of the Committee—the hon. Member for Ayr—seems to be going around Scotland stirring up trouble and moving amendments in Committee. It is to the credit of the hon. Members for Aberdeen, South, and for Kincardine and Deeside and especially the hon. Member for Tayside, North, who is the most distinguished member of the Committee, that they are not doing that. They are concentrating on their own areas which they understand and know something about. That is very much to their credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know better than to make such comments. Any hon. Member can table amendments reflecting any aspect of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr has tabled amendments simply because he has been approached to do so. Had I been approached I would probably have tabled amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is open to any hon. Member to table amendments, but it is notable that the hon. Member for Tayside, North and others have not been approached. There is much suspicion about the source of the inspiration for the amendments that have been tabled. They all stir up trouble. They set council against council, and that creates problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a contribution to the debate in which I proposed an amendment concerning the north. He lived in the north at one time and was born in Keith in Grampian region. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr has worked in various places in Scotland and has an interest in and knowledge of various places in Scotland. Is it not therefore reasonable that he should contribute to the debates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Ayr has had to move around Scotland quite a lot, but as for the debate on Westhill, I merely intervened in the speech by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside to ask a question. I did not make a speech. I certainly did not move an amendment in relation to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr reflects the case advanced by a perfectly responsible all-party delegation from Clydesdale district council. Do I detect from the hon. Gentleman's comments that he does not want these questions discussed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite happy for those matters to be considered, but if the Minister is to consider them he should do so properly, listening to delegations and taking account of what they say. The amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Ayr who seems to be a freelance amendment tabler on behalf of various organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
