	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I notice the presence of cameras in the Committee Room. I understand that the BBC current affairs division is taking industrial action today. Could you, Mr. Hogg, tell the Committee whether the cameras here are BBC cameras and whether the people who are operating them are breaking the strike that is outwith the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no responsibilty whatever for the presence or otherwise of cameras in the Committee Room and no responsibility at all for whoever employs the cameramen. Those matters are no responsibility whatever of the Chair. I am delighted to say that the Chair also has no responsibility for the BBC—and that is just as well for it!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of law and order in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
I welcome the opportunity to have this debate on the subject of law and order. It is an important issue and one that has been at the forefront of the Government's mind, particularly over the past year. It is a matter that concerns and affects us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I have no idea who is manning the camera, Mr. Hogg, but I hope that the Opposition will not feel inhibited from participating in the debate for fear of crossing a telecommunications picket line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost exactly a year since this Committee debated crime. On that occasion, I was able to report that the figures for reported crime showed a small drop in 1992 compared with the previous year. I am happy to say that I can again report to the Committee a decrease in the levels of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The news over the past two years has been very good. In 1992, the fall mainly reflected a reduction in housebreaking and theft. In 1993, there were substantial falls in almost all categories of recorded crime. Serious assaults fell by IS per cent. and robbery by 8 per cent.—after rises respectively of 11 per cent. and 10 per cent. the year before. In addition—this will especially please my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and, indeed the whole Committee—the handling of offensive weapons fell by 21 per cent., after a 6 per cent. rise the year before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State may recall that some time ago, I tabled a question asking him how many charges and convictions there had been for offences under the Carrying of Knives etc. (Scotland) Act 1993, which was Private Member's legislation promoted by his hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. At the time, he said that he had no idea of the figures. Does he have an idea now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures with me today, but I shall be able to answer the hon. Gentleman's question, if it is tabled as a written question. I shall give him whatever information I can, as soon as I can. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will join me in welcoming the dramatic reduction in the offensive weapons category, as well as the other improvements across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are exceptional, coming as they do against a trend towards higher levels of reporting to the police. Indeed, the police clear-up rate for crimes in 1993 rose to its highest level for five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we cannot be complacent—and we shall not be. Statistics can tell only part of the story and must be treated with caution. But the information that we have entitles us to conclude that the policies of the Government and the work of the police and other agencies in partnership in preventing crime in Scotland are achieving success. For that to be maintained, we must continue to increase our efforts to involve the community as a whole in preventing and dealing with crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland want to see more police on the streets—and so do the Government. That is why we included in the justice charter specific reference to foot patrols. We are determined that as many police officers as possible will be available for operational duties, not sitting behind desks. We have increased total police strength by no fewer than 1,400 officers since 1979, and total expenditure has increased in real terms by no less than 55 per cent. I think that more can still be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jobs which do not require the powers or experience of a police constable ought to be done by civilians. During this year and last, recruitment of additional civilians should release more than 350 uniformed officers for operational duty. The welcome, if rather belated, decision by Strathclyde regional council to allow Strathclyde police to recruit up to authorised establishment will provide a further 160 officers. That amounts to more than 500 extra police officers on operational duty in two years. That is a substantial increase which ought to contribute significantly to upholding law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime figures are down and police numbers are up, but I am not content to let the matter rest there. I have a number of policies, some already in practice and others in planning, which will further strengthen the battle against crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to spend some time on the important subject of young offenders. What surprises and saddens me more than anything is the way that these young people are often presented as a type of homogeneous group. They may all be offenders, they may all commit criminal or anti-social acts, but they are individuals, and an effective response to the difficulties that they create, and to their personal needs, must recognise that fact. There are no simple answers, but we need better ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The age of the youngsters and the types of offence that they commit vary tremendously but, in broad terms, children's hearings have to consider four different categories: first-time offenders, periodic offenders, serious offenders and persistent offenders. In the final category, a small number of youngsters account for an inordinate number of incidents of crime. My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State recently announced a development project designed to create intensive progammes of intervention with persistent young offenders between the ages of 12 and 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
That innovative initiative will take the form of a project carried out by a major voluntary organisation in collaboration with local authorities. The project will offer programmes not currently available, to meet a diverse range of need and problematic behaviour in young offenders. Programmes will be tailored to individuals. They will be designed to confront young offenders with the consequences of their actions. Their aim will be to tackle behavioural and underlying problems, with a view to reducing offending. This will not be a soft option. For the young person, attendance will not be optional: the programme will be rigorous and demanding. For young offenders aged 16 and over, our objective is to provide and develop similarly effective penalties and interventions to help tackle criminal behaviour and break the cycle of offending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has outlined clearly one initiative to which he wants the Committee to pay attention. He spoke of a major voluntary organisation. Why did he not name it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not mentioned its name because negotiations have not yet been concluded. We are still assessing which organisation would be the most effective in doing this work. It is a new initiative which I think the Committee will welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering that young offenders between the ages of 12 and 20, constituting about 10 per cent. of the population, commit between 30 and 40 per cent. of all crime. Against that backgroud, this initiative should be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over-16s, like those under 16, need a combination of rigorous community-based programmes wherever possible, with custody as the necessary alternative if they are a real danger to the community. There is also a positive role for the voluntary sector. A number of promising projects are under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime prevention has an important role in dealing with young offenders. I believe that it can also have a significant impact on crimes of domestic violence. One of the first issues considered by the recently established Scottish Crime Prevention Council was the problem of crimes against women. The 1988 British Crime Survey revealed that in a third of all incidents involving violence the victim was female. In four out of five, the offender was male. In 40 per cent. of incidents involving violence or the threat of violence against women, the offender was either the husband, the former husband, and current or former partner, a male relation or other male member of the household. The women's safety package, which was launched last year, is the Scottish Crime Prevention Council's direct response to the need to provide women with sensible and practical advice on personal safety and, most important, to help reduce the fear of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council recently decided to extend its work on women's safety to include domestic violence. A major national advertising campaign, which will be launched on 20 June, will target the offender in domestic violence, highlighting the criminality of the act and the offensiveness of such behaviour. The campaign will be televised in early summer and be accompanied by a poster campaign-Scottish Women's Aid, Vicitim Support Scotland, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the police have assisted the crime prevention unit to develop the campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State therefore congratulate Edinburgh district council which was the first council in Britain to initiate a "zero tolerance" campaign?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Happily. I congratulate any local authority or voluntary oganisation that takes an initiative in this important work. I emphasise that the way to succeed with these initiatives is through partnership, co-operation, pooled resources and shared commitment to tackling a serious scourge of society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State comment on proposals to encourage more safe havens for women in distress? They are a main feature when a woman with children has nowhere to go when violence has beeen inflicted on her. The Government should set aside funds for local authorities or charitable organisations to encourage the setting up of more safe havens to protect women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the importance of safe havens. The hon. Gentleman may remember that during various Committee debates on reform of local government finance in the past few years, both sides were constantly at pains to ensure that the anonymity of such havens was protected. The question of whether there is a need for more havens is constantly under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reference to domestic violence and our concern for women in that position illustrates my firm belief that it is critical that we remember the victims when discussing crime, much of our debate last year touched upon this vital matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office has actively and strongly supported the growth and development of victim support schemes. This financial year, Victim Support Scotland was offered a grant of £858,000, a significant increase on the 1993–94 grant of £764,000 compared with the £600 made available when the Association of Victim Support Schemes was launched less than 10 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend noticed that in the recent matter of West and Black the press concentrated on the evil malefactors while giving almost no attention to their unfortunate victims?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot but sympathise with my hon. and learned Friend. I would be deflected from my speech if I strayed into the matter of the way in which the press cover such crimes and other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn). What disturbed me after the Black case was publication of the interview between Robert Black and a psychologist and photographs that were taken in prison. Can the Secretary of State investigate how that came about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that the photographs were taken in prison but I share the surprise and dismay of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) at the way in which some allegedly serious and responsible newspapers gave prominence to the case, which is out of keeping with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
what most people expected. If any breach of law or prison regulations has occurred I shall ensure that it is followed up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that with my reference to figures for grants to victim support schemes I have illustrated how effective is the partnership of volunteer effort, professional co-ordination and public funding. Last year, 40,000 victims were offered help—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has been speaking about the support that the Government have been giving to voluntary associations and local authorities that help victims of crime. Can he explain why the Government have placed a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide services for offenders but repeatedly refuse to place a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide services for victims?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the approach I am outlining shows the balance that we have to strike in the range of provisions that we make for different aspects of maintenance of law and order and the treatment of criminality. At the moment I am emphasising the great importance that should be attached to victims. I sense that, on that matter, I have the support of both sides of the Committee. Whether statutory arrangements are needed in certain categories is under constant consideration. We shall be considering a range of matters as we prepare the White Paper on the criminal justice system that we have promised to produce later this summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, some 40,000 victims were offered help under 70 local schemes. Trained volunteers now deal with a wide range of victims, including the victims of more serious crime. For example, victim support is currently working on an information leaflet specifically for victims of sexual crimes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State realise that there was a great deal of concern recently in Lothian region when a man who had been convicted of rape was released pending appeal? To make that bad situation even worse, the woman and her family were not even told about that. Does the Minister have any plans to change the law in that respect so that people accused of rape cannot be released pending appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not expect me to comment on a specific case but, generally, we are reviewing those matters. We shall produce a White Paper. My noble Friend the Minster of State, in a recent speech, aired some thoughts about the tightening up of bail. I know that that is not the point that the hon. Gentleman raised, but it shows our careful consideration of the bail provisions for rape and attempted rape.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must move on. I will give way later if there is time, but I want to move to an important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most serious threats facing society in seeking to uphold law and order and to advance it is the threat from drugs. We read all too often in newspaper headlines of drug problems and I think that the Committee will wish to consider the subject today. Drug misuse causes great
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
personal anguish. It traverses the whole spectrum of criminal behaviour and, left unchallenged, it would threaten the fabric of our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to read the report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, published on 9 May. In the introduction to that the Committee referred to the fact that the use of illicit drugs in Scotland has been growing relentlessly for more than 20 years. It also said that it is a worldwide problem and that it has been described by the secretary general of Interpol as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the most serious policing problem this century".</p></blockquote>
Such a diverse problem must be met with a comprehensive response that aims not only to curb the supply of drugs, but also to create a climate in which the demand for them is reduced. It is on those twin principles that our strategy has evolved over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Select Committee's report of its inquiry into drug abuse and I congratulate the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) and his colleagues on the Committee on producing such a constructive, thought-provoking and timely report. It provides a valuable fresh perspective on the problem of drug misuse in Scotland. We are studying its recommendations and conclusions very carefully and, in the usual way, the Government will respond fully in due course. The Committee will therefore not expect me to comment in detail at this stage, but I shall make a few points. The Select Committee, like many commentators before it, found that the problem of drug misuse in Scotland was
	<br><blockquote><p>"larger, more serious and more complex than we at first imagined",</p></blockquote>
with no obvious, single solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo that sentiment. Just as there is no single reason for people taking drugs in the first place, so there is no absolute panacea. I am grateful, therefore, for the Committee's support for the current Scottish Office multi-agency approach to drug misuse. There is already a substantial infrastructure in place. Dedicated police drug squads relentlessly pursue the traffickers; tough sentences are available to the courts to punish the dealers; powers to confiscate ill-gotten gains have been taken; an increasing range of options and facilities are available for the treatment and care of misusers; and prevention activity and education in schools and more widely continue unabated. We shall not relax our efforts on any of those fronts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was heartened by the Select Committee's strenuous rebuttal of any policy that encourages the use of a drug such as cannabis. Legislation is simply not the answer. I have no hesitation in reaffirming that decriminalisation is not on our agenda. That would be a counsel of despair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee rightly stressed the need for effective co-ordination. That is an issue that the drugs task force, under my right hon. and learned friend the Minister of State, is addressing The task force is making good progress and is on schedule to produce its report later in the summer. That report will take account of the Select Committee's recommendations and, in addition to co-ordination, will focus on prevention and the provision of services. I have no doubt that both reports will contribute substantially to the future direction of our response to drug misuse in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have consulted recently on a range of measures whereby we can help the police and courts in fighting crime. They include aspects of court procedure, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
treatment of witnesses and jurors and other initiatives. We are considering our response to the consultation and will make our plans known in due course in a White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation document referred to the possible extension of fiscal fines. Can my right hon. Friend confirm that he will ensure that any extension of fiscal fines to other areas will give fines that are meaningful and a real deterrent, and not simply £25 parking fine-level fines which are no deterrent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) on that. Any initiative that we might develop on fiscal fines would be intended to offer an additional option to the prosecution services. It would not displace existing avenues open to the service, but would offer an alternative which might improve the delivery of justice and the reduction of crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State agree that the police are losing the drug trafficking battle in Scotland? He should consider how much it has escalated over the years. Is not it sad that people are being gunned down in the street and that the use of firearms is escalating with never a conviction? For my constituency and other parts of Glasgow, the morgue is a common place. What are the police going to do about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) will keep the matter in perspective. I agree with him about the importance of tackling drugs. Drug offences have been increasing, but that must be seen against the overall reduction in crime. Despite the increase in drug-related crime, the overall level of offences fell by 8 per cent. last year, on top of a smaller fall the year before. Indeed, the clear-up rate has increased. I am not prepared to concede that drug crime is out of control and I am determined that it will be got fully under control. Just as we have driven down other types of crime, so will we turn the corner and drive down drug-related crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely there is a strong argument for ensuring that additional members of our police forces are trained specifically to deal with drug-related crime and to track down the traffickers. Have we seen an increase in the 96 such offenders who existed last year? Are there any plans to increase the number of specifically trained officers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is essentially an operational matter for the individual police forces, most of which have drug squads and all of which recognise the importance of tackling drug-related crime and turning the tide, as they have effectively in other areas. The figures, when gathered from the individual police forces, will show the high priority that they give to drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian H. Donohoe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has talked constantly of delivering at some time in the future, in reviews and White Papers. He is not tying himself down to firm dates and I think that it is important that he should do so on a subject of this nature. When will he deliver?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe) misunderstands what has happened in recent years. There has been a succession of initiatives, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I have listed various things that have been done, including tightening sentencing and strengthening the commitment to tackle drug trafficking. We have done that against a worldwide tide of increased drug offences. We are not an isolated country with an isolated problem, but we have a serious problem, which the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs and criminal statistics have identified. We must continue to consider new initiatives and the co-ordination of resources and effort in a way that will succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dramatically turned the tide on non-drug-related crime, as the figures show. I said that figures should be treated with caution and we shall continue to do that. Nevertheless, two years in succession have shown not successive increases, as has been the case for years gone past, but successive and accelerating reductions. Within those overall figures, there is a problem with drug-related crime, which we are now tackling. We are building on the measures that we have already taken and that have effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about our approach in dealing with the perpetrators of crime. The phrase "making the punishement fit the crime" may be a cliché, but it encapsulates a vital truth. There is room for a variety of approaches to the treatment of offenders. Many of the ways that we have developed for dealing with offenders have been approached through social work services. We have achieved much through allocating substantially increased resources to the provision of such services in the criminal justice system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I wish to concentrate my remarks on prisons because for many, prisons are the only effective sanctions. The current prison population is 5,500, which is about 600 more than two years ago. Would that prisons were not necessary, but imprisonment remains an essential part of the fight against crime. It is the appropriate punishment for the serious and persistent offender. Ensuring the secure custody of prisoners is the prime task of the Scottish prison service. The victims of serious crime deserve no less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For prisons to be effective, levels of security should be appropriate. The criterion of the revised security classification system, introduced a year ago, is the level of dangerousness to the public. The Scottish prison service is committed to keeping good order in prisons. That is no easy task when it works with such a volatile population. Most prisoners will return, at some point, to the community. They are sent to prison as a punishment, which is right, but prisons also have a role in helping prisoners towards reintegregation into society. That requires a balanced approach; it means maintaining security while treating with fairness and humanity. It means demonstrating respect for prisoners' rights, even when they may have shown little regard for the rights of others. It means providing work, as well as opportunities to address their offending behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much is now being achieved. Under the sentence planning scheme, which began in 1992, prisoners are encouraged to address their offending behaviour. Individual establishments provide a different range of counselling and training opportunities. For example, there is an addiction counselling and information unit at Barlinnie prison for prisoners with problems with alcohol, drugs, gambling and solvent abuse. It is run with the active involvement of organisations involved in addiction counselling in the community.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Last year, we took the opportunity in the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 to reform the parole system, thereby taking forward our response to the report of the committee chaired by Lord Kincraig entitled "Review of Parole and related matters in Scotland." On publication, the report was generally welcomed and it has been valuable in establishing principles that would improve the fairness and effectiveness of the parole system. Most importantly, it will restore meaning to the full sentence of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the measures did not significantly affect the structures of penalties available to the court, they were designed to lead to greater fairness, consistency and openness in the administration of custodial sentences. As an extension of that fairness and openness, and as foreshadowed in our response to the Kincraig report, I have stopped applying a presumption against parole in any particular category of case. The restrictive policy announced in December 1984 for those serving sentences of five years or more for offences of violence or drug trafficking, therefore, no longer applies and the parole board considers such cases on the same basis as others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of the different regimes in different prisons, will the Minister comment on the state hospital at Carstairs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is he happy with a system in which psychopaths who are considered incapable of treatment get no treatment in ordinary prisons and are not considered for the state hospital? The state hospital has the undoubted advantage of having only those who are considered capable of treatment. While that secures a more favourable regime in Carstairs, is it fair on those prisoners who do not get such an opportunity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One cannot generalise between prisoners. Carstairs is in a special situation, but it is important that the prisoners' individual circumstances, their crimes and their mental condition are fully taken into account. It would be wrong to generalise from the particular, but if the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) wants to bring a specific case to my attention in more detail, I shall pursue the matter and write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have concentrated in my remarks on the roles of the various law enforcement agencies and touched on the major issues about law and order in Scotland with which we are concerned today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Prison officers' morale is an important factor in considering the proposed changes. Many officers are worried about the so-called "privatisation proposals" that are being mooted. People are trained and dedicate their whole lives to getting themselves geared up and ensuring that their talents are used to best advantage, and deregulation and proposals to privatise prisons bring instability. Can the Secretary of State assure me that that will not happen with the Scottish prison authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking not about privatisation, but about market testing of specific functions, which may include certain aspects of the prison service or, in due course, the management of an entire prison. I assure the hon. Gentleman that nothing will be done to undermine the interests of the taxpayer or the efficient and effective running of the prison system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
As the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), and I made clear when we last debated the subject of crime in Committee, if we are to prevent and reduce crime instead of just dealing with its aftermath, we must take a broad, multidisciplinary approach that goes to the roots of offending behaviour and involves the whole community. I should like to conclude by expanding briefly on that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with the perhaps obvious observation that a criminal act normally begins with the perpetrator's decision to break the law. That decision itself stems from a selfish disregard for the rights of others and the norms of acceptable behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question before us is how to stop people deciding to break the law. That in turn leads to the question of how to enhance people's respect for others and for the norms of acceptable behaviour. Some would say that deterrence has a role to play, and I agree. The prospect of apprehension and punishment can give a would-be criminal pause for thought. That is one of the reasons why we strengthened the deterrent mechanism in October last year by enabling the Lord-Advocate to appeal against unduly lenient sentences in serious cases. No one, I believe, would argue that deterrence is the whole answer. It is not fear of the consequences that keeps most people on the straight and narrow, but an appreciation of right and wrong. We need to find ways in which to strengthen that appreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a democratic society, there are, quite rightly, limits on what Governments can do to influence the values and attitudes of their people. That is why, to a great extent, we must rely on others—on parents, teachers and community leaders—to promote values that emphasise respect for others and respect for the law. One of the key goals of the Crime Prevention Council, the membership of which comes from a variety of backgrounds, is to identify ways in which to involve others in that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also have a role to play. The curriculum guidelines issued last year to schools provide one example of how the Government can encourage the promotion of positive values. I believe that other social and economic policies can also make a contribution. That is why my ministerial colleagues in the Scottish Office and I met periodically to review the contribution that each of our policies can make to the fight against crime. That is why that contribution will be one of the criteria against which major policy initiatives will be evaluated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that the public retain confidence in the criminal justice system. That is why we have continued to ensure that police forces are adequately resourced to meet the demands that they face. That is why we have undertaken a complete review of the delivery of justice in Scotland, to identify how it may be improved in dealing with not only those accused of crime, but others—whether victims, witnesses or members of juries—who may find themselves involved through civic duty. That is why, more than two years ago, we published the justice charter with the aim of raising the standard of service throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I have taken so long to make my speech this morning, but I am sure that the Committee will recognise both that I have given way frequently and that there has been a broad range of serious issues to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Our approach on many law and order issues is robust, but imaginative. The difficulties are enormous, but progress is being made, which I hope that the Committee will welcome, and I am determined to proceed relentlessly in the fight against crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During his speech, the Secretary of State referred to specific cases. I draw the Committee's attention to page 377 of "Erskine May", which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the discretion of the Chair and to the right of the House to legislate on any matter or to discuss any matters of delegated legislation, matters awaiting the adjudication of a court of law should not be brought forward in debate."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome some of the Secretary of State's comments, including his comment on offensive weapons, which shows the Labour party's prescience in that respect. We welcome the fact that crime, especially that involving offensive weapons, has fallen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Secretary of State on his remarks on young offenders. He recognised that the age of offenders and the types of offences differ, and that a variety of programmes are needed, especially those that keep young people in the community. I speak as a former schoolteacher; 10 years ago, I was in charge of an experimental truancy unit in Glasgow. The programmes are worth while, but hard to administer and I commend the Secretary of State in that respect and for reform of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, however, consider the Government's legacy since 1979, when there were 10,025 crimes of violence in Scotland. Last year, that figure rose to 19,404, an increase of 94 per cent. The Secretary of State mentioned the category of other crimes, which includes drugs offences. In 1979, there were 6,651 such crimes; in 1993, the figure had risen to 58,431, an increase of 779 per cent. The combined figure for crimes and offences in Scotland has risen from 673,000 in 1979 to almost 1 million—an increase of 46 per cent. That is the Conservatives' law and order legacy to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a simple message to the Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the hon. Gentleman's figures, which are correct. However, will he confirm that crime throughout the European Union has increased in similar proportions? In some parts of the European Union, there has been an even greater increase in crime. Are the Conservative Government responsible for that, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought, knowing the views of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) on Europe, that he would not be interested in what is happening in other parts of the continent. We are interested in Scotland, where there is not very good husbandry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My message to the Government is simple: "Stop fighting prison officers, police and local authorities, stop ignoring victims and communities devastated by drugs and crime and start fighting crime".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish criminal justice and policing system is unique; I congratulate the police and communities for bringing crime down marginally in the past two years. That is welcome but, as the Secretary of State said, it is not a matter for rejoicing. Scotland is in the lowlands, not the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
highlands, of crime on the British map because of the good work done in the community by police and Labour-controlled local authorities. In Lothian, community-based work in Wester Hailes and Pilton has led to a decrease in crime. In Strathclyde, projects such as Operation Blade led to the reduction of offences involving offensive weapons. Labour put 190 more police on the beat in Grampian and 119 more in Central region. We should contrast that activity and concern with the Government's silence, disinterest and lack of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a complete lack of action by the Government, however, but when they do act, they foul up spectacularly. Let us consider the present criminal injuries compensation scheme. Was there ever a tariff scheme so stupid and hard-hearted? In 1965, a Labour Government set up a scheme to compensate victims of violent crime on the basis of what they would have been awarded in a civil court. The tariff system grants more for the loss of a tooth than for the sexual abuse of children. That is a hard-hearted scheme, especially when we consider legal aid cuts and sheriff court fees. The Government have cut 125,000 people out of the legal aid system. A litigant has to pay part of a sheriffs salary. I came across an example of that at the beginning of January. A woman in my constiuency was subject to domestic violence. Her salary was £150 a week. She could not afford to go to court because her lawyer wanted £150 there and then. A woman on a salary of £150 a week was expected to contribute to a sheriffs salary of £1,150 a week. That is perverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman seen the research by the Glasgow Bar Association? It shows a substantial reduction in the number of cases in sheriff courts as a result of the Government's penny-pinching attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have noticed that. Another nationwide survey was undertaken. Sheriff court fees affect people who are able to take their cases to court. Others cannot get justice at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's rhetoric is good—I concede that. In "Scotland and the Union: A Partnership for Good"—a result of the "taking stock" exercise, the Government claim that they wish to confer more real rights on ordinary Scots so that individuals can exercise real choice. Where are the "real rights"? My hon. Friend the Minister for Leith mentioned victims. The Government have gone on about the predicament of victims and we heard about victims at the Tory party conference. But in February, the case to which my hon. Friend the Minister for Leith referred occurred. An individual who was sentenced for rape was allowed out the next day. I agree that justice has to prevail and I know that a person is allowed out pending appeal. But what about the victim, who sees the perpetrator of the crime in the village or the high street the next day? The system shows a lack of interest in the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned drugs and their effect on society. I have read the drug report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. All Members of Parliament were unprepared for the crime, misery and despair that were uncovered during that seven-month probe. Estimates have been made of the effect on the Scottish economy. They range from £100 million to £1 billion. Whatever those figures are—estimates or guesstimates—money is needed to feed the habit of people on drugs, that has a detrimental effect on communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Drugs are a bigger cause of death than murder in the area covered by Strathclyde regional council. They kill as many people as road accidents. Twenty thousand people inject illegal substances in Scotland—11,000 in Greater Glasgow. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudon chairs the Select Committee of Scottish Affairs. He has done sterling work. He said that he was shocked to discover that many people in the front line of the fight against drugs were in despair. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have a higher number of injectors per capita than any other city or country in the whole of Europe. This has got to be tackled."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely the hon. Gentleman's comments. Given his anxiety about the number of drug injectors, does he believe that we should encourage needle exchange systems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report states that the Select Committee did not support needle exchange systems, especially in prisons, because they could lead to more injecting. I accept that point, but I shall return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What have the Government done about drugs? The Secretary of State said that the Government had set up the Scottish drugs task force. What has the task force done since it was set up in April 1993? Nothing has been said in public. In 	<i>The Herald</i> on 10 May, Alistair Ramsay of Strathclyde's education service and a member of the task force said of the Select Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given the task that they set themselves, it's going to be very helpful … But one area we really don't know enough about is how many people are taking drugs, how many have a problem with drugs, and the link with drug-related crime."</p></blockquote>
That tells us that the Government have not moved one iota with regard to the drugs predicament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Scottish drugs task force doing? As far as I can see, it is meeting in secret conclave, perhaps in St. Andrew's house. Who knows, in a few months, perhaps we shall see a puff of white smoke from St. Andrew's house, whereupon the task force will say, "Yes, we have thought about drugs, and have done something." Meanwhile, communities are being devastated daily. It is not good enough for the Secretary of State to say that he has set up a Scottish drugs task force. What does he intend to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman berating the Scottish drugs task force. Bearing in mind the fact that the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs recognised that the problem was a large one in Scotland and that it was not uniform throughout the country, but varied from city to city and between south and north, does the hon. Gentleman expect the task force to report swiftly and ineffectively, or would he prefer my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to carry out the exercise properly? As his right hon. Friend the Minister of State said in evidence that he would also take into account our findings in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the exercise should be undertaken properly, to tackle the problem in a proper, rational and sensible way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but the Scottish drugs task force should have been set up long ago, not as late as this. If the Government had any inclination to do anything about drugs, the Scottish drugs task force would have been reporting to the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on how far matters had progressed. It should not have been the other way around. It should not have been left to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
initiative of Members of Parliament to see to it. That initiative should have come from Government. What happened is a condemnation of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a wider debate about drugs. There should be a royal commission about the matter, conducted on a United Kingdom basis—the problems are not Scotland's alone. Meanwhile, the Secretary of State should give us some outline of a national drugs strategy to tackle crime associated with drug abuse in Scotland. Nothing of that kind exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has the Secretary of State to say about social strategies for tackling crime? The Minister of State has accepted the link between social deprivation and crime, but what will the Government do with respect to policy? Areas where drug abuse is prevalent are generally characterised by poverty, consistently high unemployment and poor housing. A social strategy has to be adopted. I do not think that we need to wait for the Scottish drugs task force to tackle that issue. My question for the Secretary of State, arising from the "Taking Stock" exercise document, "Scotland and the Union: A Partnership for Good", is what real rights young people and their families in such areas have been given by the Government. Sadly, the answer is none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State spoke in his address about communities and the empowerment of citizens and communities, which he said was essential if crime was to be tackled effectively. I agree. Action must be community based. A corporate approach is needed. It cannot be market driven because in this context, the only entrepreneurs are the criminals. The approach must be community based. That is now being achieved in cities in Scotland. In the "Safer Cities" document distributed by the Home Office, the Secretary of State for the Home Department mentions that the "Safer Cities" project shows.
	<br><blockquote><p>"what can be achieved when the whole community works together to tackle crime."</p></blockquote>
He is so taken with the issue that in England and Wales, the programme is being expanded by 40 new projects, some of the first of which are opening this month. We must ask what is happening to the "Safer Cities" project in Scotland. There are five projects in Scotland: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Castlemilk and Greater Easterhouse. The Edinburgh project is finished and, apart from Aberdeen, the rest will finish next year. There will be no more. Why? Why will the programme not be expanded in Scotland? The Scottish Office has withdrawn financial support from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the programme work? It does. Many people tell us so, not least the chief constable of Glasgow, who, in his annual report, lauded the projects in Easterhouse and Castlemilk. What is the present situation with regard to the "Safer Cities" programme? My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) and I went to see the good work that was going on in the Easterhouse project and I have been contacted by the Castlemilk project. Those schemes in Strathclyde will terminate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief executive of Strathclyde has written to the Scottish Office asking for a 50:50 arrangement between the Scottish Office and Strathclyde so that the programmes can continue. He wrote to the Minister of State about that and the reply was negative. The request was refused. Strathclyde is approaching Glasgow district council and the Glasgow development agency to try to keep those programmes afloat. The Secretary of State's rhetoric differs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
markedly from the situation on the ground. These programmes are essential to the welfare of the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote a few remarks by the chief constable of Strathclyde on that. In a speech that he gave to "Safe Strathclyde" last October, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Community empowerment is a vital attribute to safe Strathclyde giving people responsibility and pride in their home areas, avoiding dependency."</p></blockquote>
One would think that the Government would be attracted to that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Strathclyde police believe in empowering communities too by consultation and dialogue at community councils, residents' associations, crime prevention panels, and local committees of the regional council. It is in these forums that local policing priorities are set and local police are held to be accountable.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Safe Strathclyde' is just one aspect, albeit an important aspect, of a social and economic strategy for the region."</p></blockquote>
Like the rest of us, the chief constable of Strathclyde knows that the social and economic strategy which has presently been applied to our cities is going to be done away with in a year or two because of the political vandalism of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill and the abolition of regions, like Strathclyde, which are fighting those issues. I mentioned earlier that I visited Easterhouse with my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton. We have seen for ourselves how the figures for recorded crime there since the project started have gone down year on year. Since the project was started in Greater Easterhouse, crime figures for 1991 to 1993 went down 17·7 per cent. In Strathclyde as a whole, they went down by 11·2 per cent. and in the neighbouring division in Strathclyde, which does not have the "Safe Strathclyde" scheme, they dropped by 7 per cent. That 17·7 reduction in crime in Easterhouse is a testimony to the good work that is going on in those "Safe Strathclyde" projects. But such schemes will be no longer, alas, because the Scottish Office is refusing to play ball.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key factor is accountability. The chief constable himself mentioned that. There is a close link between accountability and policing by consent. That is now being threatened by the Government's proposed reforms of the tripartite structure of police, central Government and local authorities. Let us consider what is happening in the House at the moment regarding—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the hon. Gentleman has finished his speech, I shall suspend the Committee for a few minutes to try to have the problem of draughts dealt with. For once, the Chairman is frozen. It would help if the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross stopped vandalising the building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are afraid that the hon. and learned Gentleman will open the window and jump out. The Opposition would miss him, but whether his side would is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To resume after that novel intervention, the close accountability between the police and the communities is threatened by current Bills. Let us consider the Government's present piecemeal approach. First we have clauses 34 and 35 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill—	<i>[Interruption]</i>—the architect of which is baying at the moment; perhaps he wants to intervene. Those clauses will remove public consultation in relation to the force structure and the geographical location of forces. No
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
longer will there be public consultation. Instead, the Secretary of State will decide the geographical nature of forces. There is, in effect, a move towards a national police force, without public accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill, despite the Secretary of State's remarks, is leading to the privatisation of prisons. Prison officers are becoming increasingly dismayed at the unilateral action taken by Government. That cannot help the prison environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill. The Secretary of State has enraged the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the police because the Government do not talk to ACPO or anyone else about their proposals for the police. The conditions of the police will certainly change. At stake is the relationship between the police and the community; that is what is threatened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Sheehy report still affects the police. There are some back-door methods of changing the role of middle-management police, to express it in that way. I wonder whether the Secretary of State will assure us that there will not be any of that? The morale of those, for instance, who are trying to study for promotion in the police is being undermined. A caste of people dedicated themselves to work against crime and yet, again, the Government seem to undermine the future of potential chief constables and others who are on the road up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke of ACPO and others consulting Opposition parties. More than one chief constable has told me that not one aspect of the proposals will enable the police to catch culprits or to reduce crime. I have before me a letter from Ian Oliver and some of his colleagues, which was written in April. It says that there are
	<br><blockquote><p>"serious reservations regarding the Bill's potential for political direction, proposed changes to rank structure, fixed-term appointments, and misconduct procedures."</p></blockquote>
One benefit of policing is that the Secretary of State cannot get his hands on the police at any time, but the change under the legislation will mean that the person in St. Andrew's house will have total control. Whether that be a Tory or a Labour Secretary of State, it is unacceptable. The police should have their independence, and that should be maintained. With the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill, the police fear that the implications of Sheehy, far from going away, have been taken out of the equation and are happening in secret elsewhere. Morale is declining day on day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reported on the comments of the chief constable of Grampian. Can he tell the Committee the views of the chief constable of Grampian and other senior officers about a single Scottish police force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has had intimate conversations with the chief constable of Grampian, to which I am not privy. However, I have spoken to the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and, as a body, it is against a national police force, as are many people in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of our communities, the police in our communities and for our cities is dismal. I mentioned the "Safe Strathclyde" scheme. What will Leslie Sharp or a successor chief constable do to get the social economic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
programme in place? He will have to negotiate, not with one but with 11 authorities. That will not be good for the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a less stategic approach and also fewer resources. Do not forget that the reform of local government takes place against a background of reducing public expenditure. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury tells us that daily in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is expenditure of £720 million on local government reorganisation worthwhile, just for the sake of a few blue dots on the Scottish political map? The answer of the Scottish people and of the Opposition parties is that it is definitely not worth that. Cities will be less safe and poorer. There will be fewer rights for citizens as a result of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will not go as far as the hon. Member for Tayside, North and ask for Lord Fraser's head. We want the Secretary of State to use his head and to see the good work for himself. He should listen to chief constables, local authorities and to communities in cities and rural areas. They are grappling with the problems day by day and they can see for themselves the hopelessness and despair to be found in our communities. They are not to be seen from St. Andrew's house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking to the Secretary of State and the Government to commit themselves to discarding their arrogance, aloofness and apathy. Instead, they should work alongside communities in a desperately difficult task. At the end of the day, it comes down to trust. In the past, we have learnt that we cannot trust the Tories on tax and on water and, from what we have heard this morning, we cannot trust the Secretary of State and his colleagues on crime either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Including those who will deliver the wind-ups, nine hon. Members are endeavouring to speak this morning. I shall ask the officials to fix the window in two minutes flat, so that we do not lose time. I suspend the Committee for two minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.31 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended</i></p>
	<p>11.33 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I commence by welcoming my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's speech on the current position on crime. The figures are moving in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I consider what the hon. Member for Dumbarton said about developments in the past 10 to 15 years, and the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North on the unfortunate trends right across Europe, I ask whether the involvement of the European Court of Justice has had an adverse effect on the way in which crime has been treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is faced across Europe, and the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was fair. He referred to the change in crimes of violence and commented on knife legislation. My view is that the important aspect is not the numbers of convictions, but the perception that they are a deterrent. That more than
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
anything has ensured that the situation is better than it was two years ago. The drop in crimes of violence and in the carrying of weapons has been noticeable over that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that Opposition Members supported knife legislation on the carrying of weapons, but the most important element is stop and search and I am delighted that the Opposition seem now to accept that that is an important element in the fight against crime. They have opposed it in the past, but have now signed up to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still a civil liberties lobby against taking such steps. At times, the civil liberties supporters forget that peace and security for the law-abiding is the greatest civil liberty of all and should be at the forefront of all our thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that those who commit crime must be treated fairly. We must guard against wrongful convictions and the wide perception that the law as it stands benefits, or at least gives the benefit of the doubt, to the accused is right. We do not want the list of wrongful convictions to be extended. There have been several in recent years, perhaps not in Scotland although I get regular complaints about police involvement from my constituents. There are feelings of heavy handedness and, perhaps, unfairness in the way that some of the police deal with the public. Overall, the police in Scotland provide a good service in which I have every confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is England moving to abolish the right of silence when that is not, it appears, required in Scotland? Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister of State will answer that when he sums up. Constituents have raised that issue as they feel that Scotland is being left out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise two matters. First, my hon. Friend referred to wrongful convictions. Those were not necessarily wrong but were regarded by the English courts as being unsafe and unsound. Secondly, there is no right to silence in Scotland. We got rid of it some time ago. It has always seemed odd to me that the one person on earth who does not have to give evidence about what happened is the one whose evidence one is interested in hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that intervention. I accept what he says about convictions south of the border, and identify with it. I also agree with what he said about the right of silence in Scotland. But that message must be presented by Ministers time and again because it is not understood throughout Scotland. I hope that hon. Members who support that situation in Scotland will support the Government on the abandonment of the right of silence and that they will do so at all stages of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to take up several civil liberties issues with my hon. Friends who represent constituencies south of the border. First, there has been much talk of the use of identity cards recently. They are something that we can sign up to, with benefits for the police and society at large. They will help the police to pinpoint individuals and tie them to addresses, saving a heck of a lot of wasted time currently spent trying to ensure that individuals report. People also often give fictitious addresses. Identity cards are one way of getting round such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other benefits. There is illegal immigration; as European boundaries change and more and more people flow from country to country, identity cards will become
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
essential. They are not new in Europe, because virtually every other European country has signed up to identity cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important use of the cards would be against under-age drinking, which all members of the Committee feel strongly about. Identity cards would help publicans—and tobacconists—to ensure that youngsters did not gain possession of alcohol and cigarettes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wider issues have to be considered when civil liberties are examined. In Singapore, the Government have their own remedies for crime. An American youth suffered one of the penalties; he will not be likely to recreate the problems of vandalism that he caused. Since that time the media have done society, certainly in the western world, a great disservice by paying that individual extraordinarily high sums for the story of his misdemeanours. That is an unfortunate aspect which has detracted from the idea of punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred to the fact that detection has improved considerably recently, but while examining the performance of the police we should also examine the performance of the courts. Herein lies a major activity area for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the Scottish legal system is absolutely wonderful, in the main by those who operate in it. That is not the perception of those outside it, and a great many queries on that score have to be answered. There is a great deal of delay in the courts that seems frequently to benefit the lawyers and those working in the system at the expense of the people who are trying to use the criminal justice and civil law systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I listen to people such as the president of the Law Society, Ian Dunbar, talking about the issues, I sometimes wonder whether his principal intention is to preserve the interests of those in the legal profession, not to meet the needs of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want particularly to discuss the report on the use of bail. I welcome its conclusions, which are much in line with the ideas that many members of the Committee have discussed recently—about the inconsistencies in the use of bail throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report suggests that there is confusion about the Wheatley guidelines, but what frightens and annoys me more than anything is the statement that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some Procurators and Sheriffs do not regard them as relevant".</p></blockquote>
The Wheatley proposals established three basic rules for considering bail. When the accused offends shortly after release from prison and looks likely to offend again, bail should not be considered, nor should it be considered when the accused has apparently offended when on bail or on release on licence or parole. Where there is concern about witness intimidation, bail should not be considered. The courts are letting us down badly in that area, as are the sheriff and procurator fiscal services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take care not to be specific about cases before the courts, but I have read in the press of a case where an individual held a bottle or a knife to a young girl who worked in a garage, threatened her, robbed her, and took her into the back room of the garage and raped her. The police entered the garage and found the person terrorising the girl. Those events were recorded on video camera, but the court released that individual on bail. He lives in the same village as his victim. There is something
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
fundamentally wrong with a system that allows that to happen. That does not prejudge the verdict of whether the individual is guilty. My comments are addressed specifically towards the use of bail in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples. People committed three or four crimes of a similar nature between Ayr and Glasgow. They were charged with serious vandalism and theft from cars on four occasions, and it was only on the fourth occasion that they were remanded. That is another matter that will be addressed when the Minister examines the bail report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sentencing, too, can frequently be a joke. Much has been said today about drug pushers and the drug scene in Scotland. But recently, in a court in Ayr, someone who had sold drugs to 13 and 14-years-old schoolgirls was found guilty and given a suspended sentence and community service. That is absolutely wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because the two cases to which he refers involved constituents of mine, as I think he is aware. In the second case I have written to the lord advocate, asking him to use his powers to appeal against that light sentence and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support me in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can be assured that I will support him on that matter. It was my amendment in the proceedings on the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 which introduced that appeal. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister on how many occasions that facility has been taken up by the procurator service. I do not think that it has been used as much as it should have been. I should like to think that the facility would be used in the case referred to by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Committee on the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said that I had been a bit of a hardliner and perhaps had not aligned myself entirely with my hon. Friends on the Committee. I felt at that time that it was wrong to introduce a system in which four-year sentences would be two-year sentences, two-year sentences, one year and 12-year sentences eight years at worst. The system has no control over parole issues. Even if prisoners are not considered ready to come out into society, they are automatically entitled to be released on parole once two thirds of the sentence has been served. That is something we should keep under constant review. We should take time to address the problem currently faced by society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quickly going through my notes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it fair for hon. Members to speak for 20 minutes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a little unfair to ask me that. As long as what hon. Members are saying is in order, they can speak for the rest of the day. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Ayr is coming to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unfair. I would have liked to have made many more points, but I shall make just one. I am concerned about truancy in our schools as I believe that it has a bearing on the level of juvenile crime. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to address the matter. I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
written to him several times on the subject and have had reasonable responses. There seems to be a great deal of research going on into the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One simple way of dealing with truancy would be to withhold family allowances for errant children. That would concentrate parents' minds and make them take more interest in the child's attendance at school. That would be good for the child, good for society and good for the crime figures in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and not follow the example of the hon. Member for Ayr, because I realise that many other hon. Members want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee are interested in the issue of drugs and many contributed to the Select Committee's report. I am sure that it was not intentional, but the hon. Member for Dumbarton gave the impression that the problem of drugs is associated solely with cities and conurbations. In fact, drugs are a major problem in many of our rural areas. I am sure that the Scottish Office will pay particular attention to reports from Grampian police on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention earlier today, I pointed out to the Secretary of State the need for more police officers to be specifically dedicated to tackling drugs. I also raised the matter in the Committee on Tuesday 25 May last year, and pointed out to the Secretary of State that only 96 such officers operated in Scotland. The Secretary of State, in response, rounded on Strathclyde region for not providing sufficient policing facilities. I was asking not about local operational police officers, but about a national strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our police services in Scotland have a right to full training and support to build up a national strategy in co-operation with the various other organisations involved in the prevention of the importing or trafficking of drugs. Anyone who has even skimmed through the Select Committee's report will be aware of the depth of the problem that faces our nation and, I believe, threatens our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A senior police officer told me that, however strongly I may oppose nuclear weapons and nuclear power, the use of drugs is the greatest current threat to our society. It undermines our communities and family values and I believe that we must address it seriously. I hope that when the Government produce the report from the task force there will be a key national strategy involving all the agencies and the whole of society—not just teachers, police and customs. We must address the issue quickly, because if we do not, I fear for the fabric of our existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I spoke to representatives of the police force in my area, and one concern drawn to my attention was that about sentencing policy. There is a feeling that mixed messages are being given to the police force and to the community. One officer said that the sentences given often cause as much distress to the families of victims as did the original crime. Law Officers have a responsibility to consider overall sentencing policy and to ensure that people feel that sentences are consistent and that the victim is not ignored. Given what has happened to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, many people feel that the legal system is failing victims and supporting the perpetrators of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Offending while on bail was another issue drawn to my attention. Many people on bail see no problem with committing a further crime because they will be sentenced only for their original crime. Although I endorse the points made by the hon. Member for Ayr about the report on bail that has been published, the problem has to be tackled quickly if the public are to have confidence in the courts that operate on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State dealt seriously with the issue of women. All of us welcomed his points on domestic and sexual violence and on rape. Last year, during the debate on law and order, it was announced that £65,000 would be spent by the Scottish Office on promoting safety for women by means of video cassettes. That was an effective measure which was very much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect of that problem, which I have drawn to the attention of the police force in my area, is the safety of women drivers. Recent research has shown that women drivers are afraid at night both in cities and on the long stretches of rural roads along which the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) and I often have to drive in the course of our duties. In our area, Grampian police mounted four courses to draw attention to the practices that women should observe to ensure that they are safe in their cars. Such advice was also issued by the Scottish Office, but I wonder whether it is undertaking additional work in that sphere. It is one area in which we can enhance the safety of women on their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, I have a personal interest in the prison service and I have raised issues with him during debates on, for example, Second Reading and Report of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill. I am worried that prison officers, like police officers, are having their morale greatly lowered. I asked the Minister questions about early retirement, recruitment and market testing, and he replied to me earlier this month. I detect an element of complacency in his letter; he states that prison establishments are currently more or less up to complement. To say "more or less up to complement" is not an adequate response; it does not ensure that prison staff are up to full complement. They have to face many daily hazards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of market testing, it has been suggested that the Government anticipate a saving of £0.4 million a year on existing costs of £4.5 million for in-house teams and various aspects of the prison service. It is wrong to measure the prison service solely in terms of costs and savings. It has to perform a long, arduous and difficult task, dealing with people who must be imprisoned for the safety of society and for their remedial benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to tackle morale in the prison service. The fear of privatisation after market testing is in the minds of prison staff. Many good, qualified members of staff will take early retirement and be lost to the prison service and society will suffer as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate on one topic pertaining to the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). It would be appropriate to record the sadness of all in this Room at the reason why the hon. Gentleman is not present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I refer to the biggest crime against civilisation perpetrated anywhere in the western world since 1945, for such was Lockerbie. I raised the matter on Thursday in Prime Minister's Question Time, asking the Prime Minister if he would
	<br><blockquote><p>"have discussions with the German Government about the statements of Edwin Bollier and Ulrich Lumpert concerning the destruction of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie."</p></blockquote>
Bollier and Lumpert were the manufacturers of the crucial timers. The Prime Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish prosecuting authorities and police have worked closely with their German counterparters in the course of the Lockerbie investigation. Any discussion of evidence or information which may be relevant to the investigation will be a matter for the Crown Office and the Dumfries and Galloway constabulary."</p></blockquote>
I asked a further question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So why has Bollier's written request to have a sight of his timers, so that he can determine whether they were in the batch that went to Libya or the batch that went to Stasi, been turned down?"—[	<i>Official Report],</i> 19 May 1994; Vol. 253, c. 956.]</p></blockquote>
The Prime Minister did not answer that question. I had asked him not about his engagements, but about a very specific matter on the Parliamentary Order Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had taken the trouble to have a long interview with Mr. De Fonblanque, an under-secretary at the Foreign Office responsible for security, and with a senior official of the anti-terrorist unit at the Foreign Office who must be nameless. There was every reason why the Prime Minister might have given an explanation. Those who follow these matters can read for themselves the Prime Minister's answer in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I now repeat my question and ask why Bollier and Lumpert are not being shown their timers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that I ask if the investigation is still active. On 21 December, the BBC transmitted the following answer by Bollier to a question from Gerry Northam:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I remembered that two such prototypes were delivered to the East German army. I took them myself to east Berlin in 1985—to a representative of the purchasing department for the army and the police. I know the name of this gentleman."</p></blockquote>
Gerry Northam then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Herr Bollier says he was reminded of his delivery to East Germany by one of his staff, Ulrich Lumpert. Herr Lumpert is an engineer and says he remembers having come to work on a Saturday to get the prototype timers ready."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to go into the endless Foreign Office aspects of the matter; I simply ask why the Lord-Advocate's Department and the Crown Office—to whom the buck was passed by the Prime Minister and, as far as I can make out, by the Foreign Office—have not followed up the matter, especially in light of Bollier's statement that he was threatened by people in Switzerland that terrible things would happen to him if he revealed that his timers had gone anywhere but Libya.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is my only opportunity to put the matter in Parliament to the Lord-Advocate. If the investigation remains serious, why have not the Government seen Bollier or Lumpert? Why have they not interviewed Khreesat, an alleged bomb maker? Why have they not seen Don Goddard or contacted Lester Coleman, who has written a long book entitled "On the Trail of the Octopus"? It is fanciful to dismiss Goddard as a conman. For 10 years, he was senior editor of the 	<i>New York Times.</i> It is preposterous to claim that he is anti-American. Why have not the Government accepted the public invitation to see Ahmed Jibril?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
It seems to the world that Britain does not wish to ascertain the truth about the dreadful event. Anyone who saw the results of Lockerbie knows how dreadful it was. Rita Cadman, whose son died in the tragedy, wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am convinced that the government knows and isn't going to tell: and that it intends to stop the truth coming out."</p></blockquote>
That is also the view of Dr. Jim Swire, with whom I have been in contact for more than four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not wish to answer today. He may not know much about local government, but if he applies his mind, he knows a lot about the sort of issue that we are discussing. No one could have written such an excellent book as "Motive for a Mission: The Story Behind Hess's Flight to Britain" or "The Air Battle for Malta" without clearly understanding security and security-related issues. The Minister has a serious obligation to speak to the Lord-Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to me, on 7 January 1994, the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact remains that the exhaustive investigation by Dumfries and Galloway police has not revealed any evidence".</p></blockquote>
It is nonsense to claim that the investigation has been exhaustive. If it had been exhaustive, the police would have examined the new evidence. On 10 May, in a letter to me, the same Minister said that it would not be right for him to comment on any article that sought to explore the available evidence. He was referring to the article in 	<i>Der Spiegel.</i> He went on to say that the Secretary of State had recently stated in Parliament that the Lord-Advocate had not seen any evidence that would cause him not to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Dumfries and Galloway police made any effort recently to produce the sort of evidence that the Lord-Advocate should see? Whether the evidence is accepted and whether some of the witnesses, for example, Bollier, are found wanting, is another matter. The police seem not to have lifted a finger to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lockerbie disaster is the biggest crime against western civilians since 1945. It is 32 years since I first spoke in the Scottish Grand Committee and I have never spoken more seriously. I believe that the Crown Office is party to a sham investigation which is cruel to the Libyans, cruel to the relatives and cruel to all who demanded that the truth be revealed about this terrible affair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot get it out of my mind that Lady Thatcher and presidents of the United States agreed that it should be kept low profile. Is not it incredible that in more than 800 pages of her memoirs, that lady did not once mention Lockerbie? There was an agreement with the Americans to keep the case low profile partly, perhaps, for Syrian and Iranian reasons and partly for the extraordinary reason that those who obtained passages on that plane—poor Flora Swire and those poor kids from the university of Rochester, New York—obtained those places in the very difficult pre-Christmas transatlantic traffic because those seats had been cancelled after being due to take officials from the American embassies in Moscow and elsewhere in eastern Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, and this will be shown in a film by Allan Francovitch and others, that the truth is that from an early stage, the American Government—certainly—and the British Government, or some members of it, almost certainly had a clear idea of who had perpetrated the crime. Libya is, in fact, a scapegoat.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
All of this has been put into the court of the Lord-Advocate. I regret that he is not a Member of Parliament, although I make no complaint about that because the Labour Government could do the same. But sooner or later the Lord-Advocate will no longer be able to take refuge in narrow legalities, but will have to make a real effort to say what the British Government knew and when.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton made some play about figures. I hope that he accepts that my understanding of the police reporting of crime is that between 1981 and 1992, crime increased by 58 per cent. He chose to ignore the fact that the Scottish crime survey showed an increase of only 5 per cent. over that period. My point is that we can all play with figures. The hon. Member for Dumbarton chose to ignore completely the European and world dimension to certain aspects of crime. He also confused, again deliberately, civil cases with criminal cases. The record will show that he was again trying to make a case that would not stand up when carefully examined. The truth is that police numbers in Scotland have increased substantially since 1979 and their pay and conditions have improved beyond all recognition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a moment. I can remember the winter of discontent and the concern in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer back to the hon. Gentleman's accusation that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton had confused civil and criminal cases? My hon. Friend was referring to a case of domestic violence. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is not a criminal offence for a man to beat his wife? If that is what he is saying, does not he think that it should be a criminal offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman studies the record, he will find that I was not out of order in what I said. I heard exactly what the hon. Member for Dumbarton said, including the aspect to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and that will be borne in mind by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee for too long as I wish others to participate in the debate. The fact that I will not make a long speech does not mean that I do not care about the situation. We claim to live in a civilised society yet in Europe and elsewhere we frequently fail to teach our children the difference between right and wrong. That failure occurs in the home and, more importantly from our point of view, in schools. In schools, the attitude of local authorities and individual schools is such that they oppose what is sensible. I shall discuss that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine the problems that we face. We live in a world where mobility at all levels is enormous: cars, motorcycles, aircraft, ships and other means of transport ensure that. Criminals can move quickly and are not confined to one area. Many of those who are caught housebreaking in north Tayside do not live there; they often come from a long way away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in a world where drugs are a massive international problem. There was not one mention by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) of the splendid work being done by undercover operatives in drugs
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
operations. Throughout Europe and elsewhere the people who work on behalf of the Revenue do a tremendous job. All the hon. Gentleman did was complain about what was not happening. Why do not we occassionally hear of the successes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plain truth is that dedicated people put in an enormous amount of work in Customs and Excise and do not receive the credit that they should. Many of them take tremendous risks and we should recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in a world where guns are no longer confined to specific areas; they are an international problem. We see violence everywhere. The so-called serial killers are not serial killers—that description is down to the media—but evil multiple killers. It is about time that we began to call things by their correct names instead of giving them tags that are goods for the media and the sound bite. The media have a great deal to answer for. They are responsible for cult attitudes and peer pressure of a sort that did not exist 15 or 20 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prevention is far better than cure, although I accept that deterrent sentences have a part to play in the criminal justice system. I support deterrent sentences and feel that there is not an adequate number of them. However, they will not in themselves solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole matter must be examined and I welcome the positive interest that the Government have taken in the voluntary sector. Whey my hon. Friends the Ministers discuss the voluntary sector, they should not forget the good work done be scouts and cadet forces. The uniformed bodies do a tremendous job. When I said that local authorities and schools are frequently hostile to what is sensible, I had them in mind. There are instances of their being prevented from going to schools to tell youngsters about the forces, which is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be changes in attitude by schools and by local authorities, and more positive continuing action from the Government on the use of voluntary bodies, because that will do a great deal to help with the problems of crime. In particular, we have to accept that because we live in a world where people are very mobile, crime is an international problem that cannot be solved in Scotland alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have established today that the biggest single problem facing Scotland is drug abuse and its relentless growth over the past 20 years. The recent report by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, which has been referred to, highlights that evil in no uncertain terms and makes a number of recommendations, which I hope the Government will take seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the taking of evidence the Commitee heard of and, indeed, saw the havoc and misery that is wrought on families and communities and on society in general with the increase in drug-related crimes. I should like to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee, the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun. I am not sorry that he is not in the Committee Room. He has done a tremendous amount of work in producing the report. I refer members of the Committee to the evidence in the report. If they have any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
worries about some of the recommendations in volume 1 of the report, they should read the evidence in volumes 2 and 3. They can then make up their own minds after having read what was actually said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said earlier, she and I have concerns because we represent rural constituencies. The problem of drug abuse has spread. It used to be associated with major cities, but it can now be found in almost every small town and village in Scotland. There is a worry that drug users in those areas may find it difficult to obtain help. Indeed, there may be a reluctance to seek help, given the nature of small communities and the fact that everybody knows what everybody else is doing, albeit in a kindly and interested fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that doctors, community nurses and social workers must become aware of the problem and know how to deal with it. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to two specific recommendations from the Scottish Affairs Select Committee report. One states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Drag Liaison Committees should be required to ascertain the extent and nature of drug misuse within rural communities."</p></blockquote>
The other recommendation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Training is…essential to help generic workers to identify drug problems and, where appropriate, refer them on to the specialist services."</p></blockquote>
But, of course, the expertise in the specialist services may not be readily available in the more remote areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of confiscation of profits made from trading in drugs, I agree that the sums involved should be used as additional resources for drug prevention programmes. However, I disagreed with an amendment that was added to the report. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend the confiscation of property where it is used for the purpose of dealing in drugs and that legislation be introduced at an early date."</p></blockquote>
I believe that that recommendation is too sweeping. I think that it is fine that the wealthy drug baron should lose his yacht, cars, casinos or whatever else. However, let us consider a father or a 16 or 17-year-old son who had been dealing in drugs from his council house, which might be either tenanted or owned. Such activity might have been taking place without the knowledge of the rest of the family. What happens to the wife and the mother and the rest of the children? If the property is confiscated, are they to be thrown out on to the streets without a home or a roof over their heads? That recommendation must be considered carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt in my mind that not nearly enough research has been done on the extent of drug misuse in Scotland. We do not know enough about it and we do not have sufficient data. I am convinced that education is of primary importance, particularly in our schools. The Minister mentioned that fact. Such education must be improved and sustained. Although the causes may be many, we cannot divorce the upsurge in drug abuse from high unemployment, poor environment in terms of housing, no facilities in huge housing estates and the lack of hope that so often permeates inner-city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word about crime, and law and order in general. Ours is an age of anxiety and crime is one of the causes. I appreciate what the Secretary of State said about the numbers of offences having fallen, particularly in Lothian, Borders, Tayside and Strathclyde. But what level have they fallen from? The hon. Member for Dumbarton
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
(Mr. McFall) touched on the fact that over 15 years of Conservative Government they have increased and increased. Too often the most vulnerable in our society-women and children—are the victims. Children can no longer play safely in the streets. We are fearful of letting them out alone. As the hon. Member for Moray mentioned, women drive with their car doors locked. I do so myself and I never thought that the day would come when I thought it prudent to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Railway stations are no longer manned. I know endless tales of women who leave their cars at unmanned stations, travel to work and return to find their cars have been broken into and vandalised. The best practice and priority has to be crime prevention. It should be achieved by partnerships between the police, local authorities and local people with practical schemes to suit their neighbourhoods. Those require Government support and need to be adequately funded. A local crime prevention task force should be set up in every local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final comment concerns the police. We have a police force in Scotland that is dedicated, disciplined and forward thinking. It is a service of which we can be justifiably proud. I hope that we do nothing to undermine it in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a brief and slightly metaphysical speech on what I believe is the cause of crime. It is not that people decide to be good or bad or to behave or misbehave: Crime is infinitely more deepseated. If I draw upon my psychiatric and legal experiences, brief as they both are, perhaps I can come to certain conclusions which may be of assistance to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am absolutely satisfied that the cause of criminality is essentially parental neglect and the feelings of inadequacy and meaninglessness which that creates in a child. One way of demonstrating one's resentment is to be beastly to other people. One way of demonstrating one's significance is to break widows, steal cars or whatever. I am sure that that is the source, and in my humble opinion neither punishment, the law nor anything else will overcome it. If children are merely plonked before television sets to watch the rubbish and senselessness instead of receiving emotional and sensible attention, there will be trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat in court and heard the judge say, "Mr. Hogg, you have been found guilty of a most appalling crime and you will go to prison for…" and one waits to see whether it will be five, seven, 12, 20, 30, 18 months. One does not know. But it does not have the slightest effect. Then the defendant says, "Oh, my God, seven!" Once he is downstairs, it is seven; he does not mind. The length of sentence has no effect, in my opinion. I do not believe that the threat of punishment or the fear of prison has any effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in school that the child must be taught manners and respect and given love and attention from an early age; it is in the home that the child must be taught love and respect and attention and affection from an earlier age. Those and all the other places of attention, which remove self-doubt and create self-significance create law and order. No punishment, no threats, no police forces, no alarms will do so. In that I am sincerely a believer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children need love and emotional attention. They resent neglect. Love one another with a pure heart fervently: if we do that we shall not have crime, which is not just something that drugs create, although it may be algebraically multiplied by the drug craze that takes people out of their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
mind. It is a terrible problem that people wish to be suspended from rationality. However, essentially, unless the great affections of the home, school, Churches and all other things make children feel that they matter, those children will become so resentful that they will exercise their resentment on others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly—because I realise that the Minister wants to wind up the debate—I should like to tell the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross, who asks why people commit crime and answers that it is because of feelings of inadequacy and rejection that stem from parental neglect, that he should ask the subsequent question: why do parents neglect their children? If he asks that, he will arrive at much the same answer as that to the original question. It is because of the social and economic conditions in which people in our society continue to have to live, under the policies that the Government have pursued for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee report made a clear link between drug abuse and the social and economic conditions that prevail in some inner-city areas and peripheral housing estates. It also accepted that there was a link between drug abuse and crime levels. Conservative Members must ask themselves about the circumstances in which some people are forced to live because of the policies that they support. What about the families scarred by poverty, who have to scrape by on incomes near, or sometimes below, the income support level? What about the income support level?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government use the phrase, "applicable amounts", referring to the amount that they consider people have to live on week by week. For a person aged over 25 the applicable amount is, I believe £45·70. People aged between 18 and 24 are expected to live on considerably less than £45·70—they are supposed to live on £36·15. People aged between 16 and 18 are expected to live on absolutely nothing, because the Government deny them any entitlement to income support or to housing benefit. They are turned on to the street. People cannot live on those paltry sums. They turn in despair to loan sharks and money-lenders and get into debt, which leads them into greater trouble. Sometimes they think that the only way out is to seek escape through drug abuse, or to get involved in crime. We shall never get on top of the problems of law and order and crime in our society until we address those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Henley research group recently published a report entitled "After the Goldrush". It pointed out—the hon. Member for Tayside, North was right about this, at least—that there are increasing inequalities and persistently high unemployment throughout Europe. People in society are thinking only of themselves and of how many consumer durables they can acquire—and damn everyone else. The welfare systems that we have had since 1945 are being undermined, and an underclass of young people and poor people, people who have been excluded from society, is turning to crime and drug abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until we learn that we must deal with the causes of crime, all the tough and effective action about which Conservative Members have spoken will be useless. The only way in which to eliminate the problem of crime, which affects every part of our society, is to eliminate the causes, which lie in the injustices of the system supported by Conservative Members. Thankfully, Opposition Members are trying to change that system for the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been marked, yet again, by two different views of who is responsible for crime. The comments made by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross were the most helpful that we have heard today from a Conservative Member. When Ministers have had a chance to reflect and to read the remarks made by the hon. and learned Gentleman, perhaps they will wonder why they did not include what he suggested in the list of initiatives announced this morning. If we do not deal with young people, we shall never be able to tackle crime in any meaningful way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition welcome some of the initiatives announced by the Secretary of State this morning. We look forward to hearing which voluntary organisations are to be involved in the young offenders initiative, which we support. We should flag up from the outset the fact that as soon as we hear the words "voluntary organisations" and "local authorities" with no mention of a commitment from central Government, we begin to suspect that it will be yet another under-funded project. If the Secretary of State is in earnest, he must assure us from the outset that sufficient funds will be available to allow the voluntary organisations and local authorities to take advantage of the initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members present this morning contributed to the excellent report of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on drug abuse, to which the Government will respond. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun chaired that Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and his right hon. Friend the Minister of State were adamant in their determination not to decriminalise cannabis, and I wonder whether they are heading for another punch-up with the police because a chief constable made it quite clear on television that he believes that, whether we like it or not, we shall have to consider legalising cannabis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had read the evidence taken by the Select Committee, he would realise that the chief constable on "Panorama" last night was completely out of line with the chief constables in Scotland. In answer to a direct question from myself on the Select Committee, the chief constable from Lothian clearly stated that he was dead against legalising cannabis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There must be a widespread debate. We cannot simply say that because the Government say that they are opposed to legalisation that is the end of the matter. Even if the chief constable is dead against it, it does not mean that that is the end of the debate. We, in this Committee, have to consider whether society is against or in favour of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the comments on domestic violence made by the Secretary of State. However, they seem a little hollow. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) reminded me that the Government have produced a good document called "Talking Sense on Domestic Violence", but at the same time, they continue to underfund women's refuges and once again, they are not providing enough finance to deal with the problem. They are good on rhetoric, but not so good on supporting the rhetoric with finances.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
I shall quickly make one or two points about some of the comments that have been made. I referred earlier to what I thought was a helpful intervention from the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. Once hon. Members who are not present have a chance to read that comment, it will give them cause for concern. It is a shame that the hon. and learned Member seems to be making some of his better contributions at a time when he has decided to leave us after the next election, whenever that occurs. Maybe between then and now, he will be able to impress on his hon. Friends some of the sentiments that were expressed today. I shared many of them, but I would add to that the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) because one needs to ask why parents neglect their children. I do not believe, and I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman does not suggest, that parents neglect their children simply because they are not concerned. They neglect them because of the pressures that they are under, as individuals living in our society. That is one of the concerns with which we have to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) made some useful comments to the Committee about the difficulties facing those who live in rural areas, and particularly the spread of drugs into such areas. Her points about the confiscation of property showed a measured approach that needs to be studied. I saw one or two people disagreeing, but we need to consider the hon. Lady's comments because property cannot be confiscated unless it can be identified as belonging to the individual who is dealing in drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two Conservative Members who contributed were, as usual—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were very good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not actually the phrase that I was going to use. At one stage, I thought that the hon. Member for Ayr was beginning to enter the realm of ludicrousness. Both he and the hon. Member for Tayside, North seemed to believe that, somehow, the European Court of Justice was responsible for all the crime in Scotland—at least, that was the thrust of their arguments. I am not sure which side of the European argument they are on, but they were clearly making statements about Europe. Once we have a chance to read their comments tomorrow, we shall be able to see exactly what they were saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can usually work quite well with the hon. Member for Tayside, North on most issues, but I cannot accept his blandishment that the media are to blame. When the hon. Member has a chance to study his comments, he will see that he laid great stress on the fact that the media were to blame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman reads my speech, he will realise that I blame, parents, schools and the media. I talked about the so-called "civilised society". I happen to think that they all have a responsiblity for the situation in which we find ourselves. It is quite wrong to look for simple single scapegoats and it is equally wrong to suggest that crime is common to one socio-economic group. It is common to all groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we shall all have a chance to consider what the hon. Gentleman said, but once he has read his comments, he will realise how much stress he laid
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
on the media. Although there is not much disagreement that the media have a role to play, we cannot blame the media for all crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up the hon. Member for Ayr on his interpretation of the recent report on bail. I think that he has got it wrong. It suggests that 52 per cent. of those remanded were eventually found to be not guilty. That is the thrust with which the Government should deal. Clearly, there are discrepancies throughout the country on bail, but that figure of 52 per cent. is something that the Government should consider if people are to have confidence in the legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not comment on the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), but his views need to be considered. If it is possible to discover exactly where the timers were manufactured and the route by which they ended up on Pan Am 103, we should investigate that. That was the thrust of my hon. Friend's remarks. I do not want to say too much because I am not an expert on that issue, but when my hon. Friend takes up an issue it usually means that it is something that has to be dealt with. We would all agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Moray and I shall leave the Minister to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party often has a reputation for being soft on crime. In part, that is because we do not accept that crime should be tackled by punishment alone. As many of my hon. Friends have made clear, we are in favour of being tough on crime, but we should also be tough on the causes of crime. Unless we are convinced that the Government are determined to be tough on the causes of crime, we shall not make sense if we simply roll out initiatives in this Committee and then discover that those initiatives cannot go forward because the Government are not tough enough to follow them up with the necessary finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State put great stress on the need to involve the community. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton referred to the "Safer Cities" programme. I spoke to the Dundee (North East) "Safer Cities" Project co-ordinator this morning. He told me that its funding ends in May 1995 after five years of central Government funding. The Scottish Office representative on that project made it clear that it will receive no further funding from central Government. It has introduced a number of initiatives in the past five years, including the Safe Taysiders project, a home security programme, personal attack alarms and the small business security scheme. They have all been innovative and useful to the community. They have also provided a better environment, so that people now look for homes in an area in which, at one stage, people did not want them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the initiative has been the massive Government support that has gone into the partnership, mainly in the Whitfield area. Unless the Government can continue to support that initiative and other housing projects in which the Dundee (North East) Safer Cities Project is involved, it will be able to deal only partly with the problems that it faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly wish to mention the innovative initiatives on home security, in respect of which the project works with Dundee district council, to provide new doors in some of the worst areas where house breaking is a problem. It also provides new lighting, security fencing and a windows programme. In addition, the Safe Taysiders project, involving school children in a four-year programme that runs into thousands, uses comics and activities to show kids
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
how to be safe. The Government need to examine such matters to ensure that we can continue the good work of the Dundee (North East) Safer Cities Project and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face a stark choice—and it is not simply between the Government and us. We can continue as best we can to manage our society's spiral of decline—With continually increasing levels of crime, increased drug abuse, no-go areas, racist attacks and people spending a fortune on security devices to protect their homes—or we can challenge the causes of decline, provide hope and direction and all play a role in creating a constructive outlet for people's—especially young people's—talents. When we read this debate tomorrow, it will be clear that the majority of us come down on the side of the second rather than the first option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first answer the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) by pointing out that there will be fully adequate funding for the young offenders project of £200,000 a year for up to five years, with co-operation from local authorities. The main referral route will be through children's panels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about Lockerbie. I shall draw his comments to the attention of the Lord-Advocate. Such matters are not within the direct responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Scotland, for the obvious reason that prosecution services are independent of the Executive, and rightly so. But I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's remarks are put before the Lord-Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North and for Ayr and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross made the relevant point that parental responsibility is extremely important. Indeed, effective crime prevention lies at the heart of any civilised society. We want young people to grow up as good citizens, with high self-esteem and proper regard and care for others. That process starts with the family and carries over into schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton mentioned the need for a proper strategy. Education has a vital role to play and in the guidelines for the five to 14 programme, we have given that high priority. Advice is given on social rules, rights and responsibilities and codes of law and justice. Great encouragement is given to recognition of the feelings and emotions of the individual, to sharing and to caring for others, to avoidance of dangerous lifestyles and to ways in which to seek help. Also included in the programme is advice on religious and moral education. The theme is towards encouraging a socially responsible lifestyle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East said, in effect, "Ah, well. That is good enough, but what about the second question?" In that context, he mentioned drugs. The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has made the relevant point that the link between drug misuse and deprivation may not be as straigthforward as it first seems. It has said that deprivation may not lead inexorably to drugs, but that drug misuse is an enormous problem in many areas of multiple deprivation. It is a tragedy. Drug misuse is not confined to any one section of society, as the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute said; it happens in cities and in rural areas. Many
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
people have highly respectable lives in deprived communities without resort to drug misuse. But we do, and I make this point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipate the hon. Gentleman's question. Assistance should be given. That is why we are giving the urban aid programme priority. We have supported 36 projects aimed specifically at crime prevention and 15 additional projects are starting this year. Under the urban programme, we are currently funding a number of drug-related projects costing about £1.78 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only five minutes. I should like to respond to the hon. Gentleman but that would leave some of the other points unanswered.

Some £40 million is being spent annually on drug misuse, and attendant programmes to deal with it are extremely important. I should tell the hon. Member for Moray that both the Select Committee and the task force recognise the wide dimension of drug misuse. The task force is seized of the need for a co-ordinated approach and its report will deal specifically with that issue. I should also make it quite clear, as the hon. Member for Moray raised it, that the Scottish crime squad has seen recent developments reflecting the serious view being taken of drug matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, increased police efforts are reflected in recorded drug offences which have risen from 12,000 in 1991 to 18,000 in 1993. Clearly, we must give that matter top priority. We need strong policing, stiff sentences and the provision of all necessary services. All the issues that have been raised will be considered before we respond with a report from the task force in due course.

My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr asked about bail. That matter is extremely important and is currently being considered. We intend to produce proposals at the next legislative opportunity to make, for example, offences of rape or attempted rape not bailable if the accused has a conviction for a similar offence. I assure my hon. Friend that the Crown Office and the police will examine the guidelines for the police, and that the Home Office will reexamine guidelines for the procurator fiscal service. It is important for public peace of mind that relevant and necessary action is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the right of silence. We already have a provision allowing comment on silence during a judicial examination. We would consult before considering any amendment to the right of silence at trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray spoke about research on victims. The Crown Office is sponsoring research to see how the system can be improved. That is expected to be completed in 1995, and we think that research can point the way to dealing more effectively with the matter in future. We will give the results of the research the most thorough consideration as soon as they are to hand.

The hon. Members for Dumbarton and for Dundee, West asked about the safer cities programme. Highly successful safer cities projects are being evaluated. There is evidence that local authorities have drawn positive lessons from the programme and city-wide initiatives are being discussed in, for example, Dundee, to which I pay tribute, and elsewhere. For example, an experimental women's

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
safety programme has been pursued in Lothian after being piloted in a safer cities area. Hon. Members will appreciate that local authorities can conduct these policies as corporate, region-wide programmes and "Safe Strathclyde" is a case in point.

I should tell my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr that we consider it important to have the necessary information and research on truancy. We have published a support pack that will be issued to all Scottish schools this summer stressing the importance of parental responsibility. We have also issued an advice pack on bullying which has been so successful that it has gone not only to Scottish schools but has been ordered widely in England and Wales. We have appointed an anti-bullying development officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that his duties go far beyond the duties of that office. We have taken the initiative of establishing the first anti-bullying development officer in Britain. That is a great success. We have also commissioned a support pack for schools on discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police morale is extremely important and I pay tribute to Operation Blade, Operation Spur and Operation Dove. Those excellent operations involved the round-up of knives, targeting of guns and saturation police presence in
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Paisley. They are examples of the successful operations that have taken place recently to which we should give full support.
