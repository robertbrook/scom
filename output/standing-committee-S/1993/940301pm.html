	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. It will not have escaped your notice that, just before the sitting commenced, the Minister with responsibility for education and housing at the Scottish Office, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), handed members of the Committee a two-and-a-half-page letter. The letter was about the debates and points of order that occurred earlier today. I should like to study the letter because I think that it only partially covers the issues raised on points of order. I might feel obliged to raise a point of order with you, Sir James, to seek further clarification on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. This morning a point of order was raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), which had nothing whatever to do with the stage that the Committee was at or with the amendments on the amendment paper. Once again, he raises a point of order as a means of conducting some sort of vendetta. I suggest that it has nothing to do with the conduct of the Committee, but has everything to do with his personal aspirations. He is demonstrating clearly that he is not abreast of the conduct of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I received a copy of the letter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton referred. I should like to place on record, on behalf of my hon. Friends and myself, our thanks to the Minister for writing to us. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, I warn the Minister that we are not at all happy with its contents and we reserve the right to raise questions on them later in the sitting. We would like to speak after the Minister, when the opportunity arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I thank the Minister for not only sending me the letter, but for hand addressing the envelope. I notice that that has not been done for other members of the Committee—they all had theirs typed. I am singularly honoured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence in the judgment of my co-Chairman and I am sure that his ruling this morning dealt adequately with the situation. At any stage, any member of the Committee may raise a point of order. We must now proceed with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) spoke about personal aspirations. I know that you were not here this morning, Sir James, but I was blushing at the end of the morning, although I know that you will find that difficult to believe. I have had three and a half hours to recover from the sedentary blandishments of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is not the Minister with responsibility for Housing and education, but the Minister for just about everything else, apart form agriculture, which is dealt with by another Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Minister on the topic of decentralisation, but I do not think that he understands the implications of what is being discussed in the clause or the amendments. Te decentralisation shcemes are supposed to counter the effect of increasing the size of some authorities. Decentralisation will be much more important to particularly large authorities covering certain services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not contrast the complete difference that there will be between decentralisation schemes for the Highlands—particularly if they go ahead as one authority—and those in, for example, East Renfrewshire if, heaven forbid, it goes ahead as one authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's every word. Within about five seconds of him leaping to his feet, the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Hamilton, sprinted out of the Room. Can the hon. Gentleman give the reason for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked my hon. Friend to get me something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend ask for a bottle of Scottish water? My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) and I are the only members of the Committee who do not have a bottle of water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that we have a new Chairman, I hope that he will take account of my hon. Friend's words. Those on the extreme Back Benches, the 'umble ones, do not get bottles of Scottish water. The Chairman gets a bottle the Minister receives two bottles; hon. Members on the second row have bottles, but we do not. For once, I am in total agreement with the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, I am not discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we have heard enough about water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wished to speak about decentralisation. I thought that the Minister's intervention would deal with that, but it diverted me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet discussed making the Highlands one authority, but a proposal to do that is included in the Bill. It that happens, decentralisation will be necessary. Services for Wick, Thurso, Ullapool and all parts of Highland region cannot be run from Inverness. It is at least theoretically possible for services to be run centrally in a small, compact, homogenous area such as East Renfrewshire. It is important to recognise differences between areas. The whole structure that the Minister proposes becomes crazier as the Bill progresses. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) used the word "crazy" to some effect this morning. As the structure becomes crazier, a patchwork set up will exist for decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decentralisation had several effects. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) rightly said, Strathclyde pioneered decentralisation. That is understandable because the authority is large. But the decentralisation is to its credit. The amendment covers local committees and the reasons for including representatives of community groups on them. Strathclyde authority set up local committees. Its memorandum stated that the main reason for establishing local committees was to ensure that local services were even more responsive to the needs of local communities. To achieve that aim, representatives of community groups should be included on local committees. That is the basis four our amendment, and I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept it. Let us consider the Highlands. Perhaps one councillor will represent Wick, but one councillor is not a committee. It would be easy for a one-councillor body to have a quorum and even easier for to achieve a majority. Sometimes, I relish the thought of one-person committees, especially in the Labour party. However, it would be impossible for a committee of one to
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
function in the circumstances that we are discussing. Therefore, the involvement of representatives of community groups is vital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a serious speech. I have agreed with much of it so far. A difficulty with placing the amendment in statute is framing a statutory definition of "community group".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, to which I shall return, although it does not fit in with my comments. I do not have advisers in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My arguments about the Highlands also apply to Dumfries and Galloway about which the Secretary of State will be especially worried. I am worried that some Opposition Members, let alone the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, do not realise how big Dumfries and Galloway is. It takes a terrifically long time to travel from Stranraer to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir H. Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Langholm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Langholm. I am grateful to the Minister. That was a useful sedentary contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The differences between different parts of Dumfries and Galloway are very great. The Minister has a good point, in that certain community groups will be appropriate in some areas, and other community groups in other areas. However, putting community groups as a generic term on a statutory basis will not inhibit a local authority or make its task too difficult. It would be for a local authority to decide which community groups it would be appropriate to involve, but in so doing that authority would satisfy the terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I recognise the difficulties outlined by the Minister, does my hon. Friend not agree that the community groups that will be involved can be included in the scheme for decentralisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend Clause 23(9) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, after consulting such associations of local authorities and such other persons as appear to him to be appropriate, issue guidance with respect to the form and content of decentralisation schemes."</p></blockquote>
It would be up to the Secretary of State—who would be my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton by that time—to issue guidance about the appropriate community organisations that should be involved. There is no difficulty with the amendment, given the will to involve community groups. If that will exists, it should be on the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that the amendments merely apply to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and (d), which depend on subsection (2)? That states that the foregoing "may inlcude provision", so the provisions would not be statutory for every local authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
in Scotland. The amendments would mean that local authorities may consider holding consultations with local community groups. They would not be required to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is technically correct, although I hope that the amendment would mean that such consultation would be a strong obligation, if not a statutory requirement. I have long been associated with Age Concern. Last week I got into trouble with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about ageism, so I had better be careful, but I know that Age Concern would be an appropriate body to be involved. I may be biased, but that organisation is very active throughout Dumfries and Galloway, Ayrshire and the Highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sees decentralisation as a no-cost option. That is a narrow and unwise perception I do not suggest that it will involve enormous expenditure, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is that my hon. Friend the Minister said that decentralisation would nt be an excessive cost option. It could be a cost option, given that it would be up to individual local authorities. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the cost could be minimised by building on existing structures and organisations, as my hon. Friend the Minister said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. We are making some progress. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside got the nod from the Minister, so he may have spoken with some authority. It is a step forward to acknowledge that decentralisation is a low-cost rather than a no-cost option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak to amendment No. 220, which relates to the provision officers, and administrative arrangements. Some officers might otherwise be centralised in Inverness, Dumfries or Ayr, and be farmed out to Girvan, Stranraer, Ullapool or elsewhere. That would be a great step forward. Some of the people in central administration headquarters need not be there. They would carry out their functions more efficiently if they were decentralised. Of course some people must be at central headquarters. I am greatly honoured. Word must have reached the Secretary of State at St. Andrews house that I am on my feet because he is in the Public Gallery. Am I allowed to mention that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps he heard that I am talking about Dumfries and Galloway and the importance of decentralisation there. Decentralisation is not just taking some staff out of headquarters and putting them into local offices. One of Strathclyde's terms of reference—a good model to look to when the Secretary of State draws up guidelines—is to ensure that regional services work corporately to address major issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worked with the local committee and the local office in Ayr which was decentralised from Strathclyde. They have officers whocse special responsibility is trying to
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
ensure that individual service officers work corporately. That involves added cost, but it is worthwhile because it ensures more effective delivery of services. I hope that the decentralisation scheme will look at incurring extra cost for provision of a person or persons to help co-ordinate services provided locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other specifications in the guidelines relate to making local services and their managers accountable to local elected members and, through them, more accountable to local communities. Again I am thinking of Strathclyde's scheme. There can be accountability at local level, and not only with the whole council, whether it be Dumfries and Galloway, Ayrshire or Highland council. Local accountability can operate directly. Where there are half a dozen, or eight or nine, members, there is a basis of a committee that can meet locally, as happened in Ayrshire, Cumnock and Doon Valley, and Kyle and Carrick. It can examine the needs of each district. The new structure does not give a clear remit, so I fear that there will be fewer councillors in some widespread authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have representatives of community groups on local authorities to make local services and their managers more accountable to local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we discuss the type of groups that might be involved, I mentioned Age Concern because I know of its work. I am thinking of Elsie Menzies, in Cumnock in my constituency, who is the leader and chairman of Age Concern. She received the MBE recently, something that she and I are proud of. She has not been directly involved as a candidate in party politics but can contribute a great deal to the community. She is an obvious choice. Similarly, Mrs Aileen Morland of Girvan is chairperson.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Convenor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Mrs. Morland is convenor of the local Age Concern committee, and another obvious choice. I hesitate to suggest this for Ayr because the president of Age Concern, Ayr, is my mother. I am sure that there would be a suggestion of whatever is the opposite of nepotism if I suggested that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand that Kyle and Carrick district council has plans to decentralise some of its services to Spain. Would it not be useful for members of Age Concern in south Ayrshire to make trips to Spain to monitor their operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that many elderly people go to Spain with Saga Holidays and others for long periods, and save a lot of money by doing so, but that is not relevant to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example of the sort of voluntary organisations that would profitably serve the committee is those which help the disabled. Thankfully, increasing numbers of people realise that they play an important part in the consideration of local services. They know that to enable proper access for disabled people and to allow the needs of such people to be taken into account is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
In my area, south Ayrshire, the Disablement Income Group, the South Ayrshire Disabled Club and Arthritis Care are three active groups that could provide someone with knowledge and understanding to serve on a committee of the type that we suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any reason why these good people, including the wonderful Elsie Menzies, could not stand for the council and have full input?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. Not everyone wishes to stand for the council. It is quite a hard job that involves a great deal of commitment which some are unable to make. Also, some people might not wish to be identified publicly with a party, even though they are involved in it locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, they may spend all their time in their local community which they want to serve, but they may not wish to go to headquarters day after day to attend meetings. Such people can look after local interests and serve the community well as members of a committee without necessarily taking on the responsibility of being an area councillor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they do not want to go the whole hog for the main local authority, might they not contemplate being members of the community council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Options are being suggested. I am talking of local committees whose concern is delivery of services for the councils. Although many services are being hived off, the councils will still have a range of important responsibilities. Involving people in local delivery of services gives them an important role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are possibly hearing the response of hardened politicians who think that the only reason for becoming involved in and influencing the community is to take all of the decisions for all of the people. My hon. Friend is talking about people who have a specific interest, which they want to represent in their local community. They do not want to take on board all other views of all other groups. The community groups are usually single-issue interests, whether it is concerned with the elderly or the young or any other group. The model suggested by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside makes everyone into politicians instead of what they are, which are interested individuals, with a limited number of interests and circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although my hon. Friend spoke this morning, he still makes many useful contributions in such interventions. I agree with every word that he said. I must not cite too many examples, but I want to give a few more concerning certain organisations. I accept the comments of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside about community councils. The same point applies to school boards. Some people would want to serve on community councils and others would want to serve on school boards. But some people would be interested in education and the delivery of education as a whole in the area, from nursery education through to primary, secondary and further
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
education—such that still exists—and, above all, community education. People concerned about the whole spectrum of education would find it useful to serve on the local committees. I would welcome the participation of people involved in parent-teacher associations and other organisations to those committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest. I recognise that many people in the community would fall into the category that he described. We could end up with a heck of a lot of people who want to get involved. Has he any suggestions on how they would be selected and how many could get involved on any one issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once I am pleased that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman because he asks a valid question. The selection would have to be studied carefully. There would be competition for serving on important committees because they would have a big say in the delivery of local services. The scheme that the Minister proposes will have to be drawn up, under subsection (9) of the clause. We shall discuss that issue in a later amendment, when we propose the deletion of that paragraph. The aim of that amendment is to discuss the guidelines in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reach that point, perhaps the hon. Member for Ayr will suggest how those, people should be chosen. A scheme could be devised, under which there would be one representative for organisations concerned with the elderly, one for the disabled, one for young people and so on. We might end up with four or five people representing various sectors and interests within the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, all residents of Drongan, in my constituency, would not hesitate in suggesting that the first person on that committee should be Mrs. Margaret Drain. She is involved with Age Concern, the care of the disabled and the welfare of young people. She could look after many interests by being on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should study that issue in more detail when we reach the subsequent amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have someone from community education involved in the scheme. There is an active federation of community associations in Ayrshire. I was speaking to the secretary of the federation, Jim Murray, on Monday. He is anxious about this Bill. He is strongly in favour of an all Ayrshire authority, as are most people to whom I talk in Ayrshire. He wants community associations and community education to be represented on the committees and to be involved in consultation, as amendment No. 212 provides.

I am not involved in sporting activities now. I am a spectator these days although I played rugby in my youth—on the wing, which may surprise the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which wing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The left wing, of course. It was called wing three quarter in those days but they keep changing the

name. I used to do cross country running from time to time and one or two other things. I am a passive viewer now of some of the best soccer in Scotland at Tynecastle park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Ayrshire, there are some of the best junior football teams in the whole country. Glenafton beat Turriff 4:3 on Saturday—I understand that it was a very exciting match—and moved on to the next stage of the Scottish junior cup. The many sports organisations in Ayrshire and the rest of Scotland deserve to be involved in the local committees. They should also be consulted about setting up the committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could continue to talk about areas in my constituency and make suggestions, as the hon. Member for Ayr asked me to do. I am sure that once councils are set up, councillors will suggest the kind of bodies that should be represented from their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Bill as drafted will allow councillors to make recommendations along those lines. The hon. Gentleman's wish is contained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the position. The community groups should have the right to be involved and to be consulted, as proposed in amendment No. 212. That would clarify their role and give them a greater right to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde memorandum mentions the work of the local committee. The local committee's powers in Strathclyde have been to approve or amend local service delivery plans and budgets previously delegated to local service managers. In Strathclyde, it is estimated that the value of the budgets is more than £450 million a year. That is not a minor matter. Local committees are being given responsibilities for making recommendations to managers about service deliveries. Of course, much of that will be pre-empted because of continuing responsibilities. However, a significant amount can be decided on and influenced by local representatives. They know the local needs and demands and how they can be met. That is why it is important that they are involved in the local committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's point but there is decentralisation under the present permissive legisltion. The key point in the debate is the definition of community groups and why that should be in statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an important point. I am using Strathclyde as an example, because for all the criticism of Strathclyde—the Secretary of State made some ill-informed criticism and the Prime Minister made some even more ill-informed criticism—it is a model authority with regard to the delegation of powers and responsibilities. All regional councils should have local committees with such powers. They do not have them at the moment under the permissive legislation, but they would if the amendment were accepted. The Government have rightly—I give them credit for this—included a decentralisation clause in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second power of the local committee is to make decisions about the regional council's scheme of grants to
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
local community and voluntary organisations. That has been tremendously successful. I have seen picture after picture of my regional councillors Tommy Farrell, now chairman of the education committee, Jimmy Boyd, John Baillie and Andy Hill handing over large cheques to local community organisations. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) was the originator of this idea, and it has proved extremely successful. If you do not have it in Northern Ireland, Sir James, I recommend that you consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This scheme of grants makes a fund available to local community groups. Much good work has been done and it should continue. It would be invaluable to have representatives of community groups on the body that makes recommendations. They have an interest, as do councillors, but they also have knowledge and an understanding of the needs of the local community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Requests for grants come from those community groups, so it would be strange if they were directly involved in the issuing of grants. The current system is satisfactory, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The system is satisfactory at the moment, but the people to whom I have referred have the integrity and common sense to ensure that decisions made by the local committee are fair, honest and sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be valuable to have representatives of those local groups on the body that awards grants, because they have a knowledge of an expertise in the geographical areas involved that elected members do not have because of the size of the wards? The population of some of the regional seats is 17,000 and that of the district seats is 8,500, so it is impossible for elected members to have an in-depth knowledge of individual organisations. Many of the community representatives know the people who are on those organisations, who are doing good work and who are padding out their application. Community organisations are often tougher on other organisations than elected members, because they are interested in value for money. They are aware that other organisations would be able to apply for that money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend catches your eye later, Sir James, because he has knowledge of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give particular credit to Strathclyde for this scheme. It has already started to involve community groups under the current permissive legislation. In Greater Easterhouse, Drumchapel and in the east end of Glasgow, other representatives of local communities are on local committees. They have full voting rights but measures have been introduced to protect the council's statutory responsibilities. That is easy to do and it would be included in the scheme drawn up by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have helped, with my hon. Friends the Members for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) and for Dundee, East, to argue this powerful case. It is not aparty political issue. We may have small philosophical differences, but we are not divided on the matter. I hope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
that the Minister is convinced that we have put forward genuinely, sincerely and forcefully an argument for the involvement of community groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in organisations such as the souts and Age Concern have given a lifetime to service. As the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside highlighted, such people do not necessarily want to stand for the council and to take on those responsibilities, but they are keenly interested in the provision of services in their local areas. They know what is needed. They know where the potholes are and what repairs are required. They know what urgently needs attention in schools. They understand the demands of the social work service. I noticed that the Prime Minister was enthusiastic recently about improving street lighting—I have been saying that for years. He also suggested that there should be some prickly plants. If they will keep out burglars, I welcome prickly plants. Local people understand such issues. They have been arguing for them for longer than the Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to the new Conservative initiative of prickly plants as a crime prevention measure. Who better than local organisations to determine where to place those prickly plants? They know the best places for them because they know the routes used by criminals to and from the scene of a crime and where they can provide shelter for organisations and groups travelling on particular routes. The prickly plant question is exactly the issue for the involvement of local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should not discuss further prickly plants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to get caught on prickly plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local people understand what is needed. They know bus routes and where bus stops should be. They know what should be done about empty houses. They know about local needs. Councillors have that responsibility, but they are busy and have to go to the headquarters of the widespread authorities in Scotland. Local people are needed to give the input to the committees that will ensure that service delivery meets people's needs. I am not sure whether we have convinced the Minister to consider sympathetically the amendments. If one or two or more of my hon. Friends speak, I am sure that we can convince him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke to my hon. Friend for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley this morning, he told me that he intended to speak on the issue but that he had not much to say. We are all grateful that he was so succinct. I am glad that he did not refer to the Secretary of State's first visit to the Committee, because that would have incurred your wrath, Sir James. That is why I shall not mention that the Secretary of State has now left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a strong supporter of decentralisation, not just at local level, but as a matter of political philosophy. I believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
in the concept of decentralisation, as do my hon. Friends. Socialism is most likely to be achieved through participative democracy. If people become involved, they are likely to remain involved and work toward the common good. The Minister said that local government should be encouraged to decentralise. The Government believe that European institutions should encourage subsidiarity to the United Kingdom. They believe that subsidiarity is good for local government and for European government, but not for central government. That is what I cannot come to terms with in the Government's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Government have at least supported that new-found policy of decentralisation. I hope that we might be at the thin end of the wedge and that there will be more decentralisation in other spheres of politics in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an interest in decentralisation. I became a member of Renfrew district council in 1984 and advanced the policy strongly. In 1988 I became leader of the council and was grateful for the opportunity to implement a programme of decentralisation. I have made the point before that the programme was implemented in the face of strong opposition from the Conservative group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Minister said that he did not share the views of the Conservative group, which accused us of wasting money. I do not admit to the charge of wasting money, but adhere to the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central that decentralisation is not cheap. It is not a no-cost option and there have to be initial investments. Councils have to decide whether they think that decentralisation to its fullest extent is a good investment in the community and in people. I believe strongly that the investment is worth while, but costly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were also accused of pandering to community activists. I have always had difficulty with the word "activist" being used as a derogatory term. I prefer people to be active rather than inactive. I am delighted that the clause provides what we were accused of—there is nothing wrong with pandering to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should place on record the stage that has been reached in the development of local government in Scotland, and how that relates to the clause and the amendment. From 1974, when the Wheatley commission established the new local authorities, diverse authorities had to be pulled together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister described the pre-1974 system as multi-tiered. For example, there were formerly seven authorities in Renfrew district which covered what is now Renfrew district council's area. It was only natural that Renfrew district council spent the period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s trying to pull together the strands of those various authorities. They had different housing allocation policies and levels of service in environmental health. The number of parks and type of leisure facilities varied. There was a natural evolution over 10 years in which the various strands were pulled together and centralised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
It was equally natural once that was done for the council to turn its mind to redefining the communities and delivering services more effectively. I welcome the Government's new-found support for decentralisation, but do not understand why a Bill containing this clause and not the other 168 clauses that we have to put up with was not brought forward. That should have happened if the Government were about bringing local government closer to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system of local government could have been decentralised. The Committee could have had a useful debate about how decentralisation could have been applied to the existing local government structure. Just about every large local authority is involved in a programme of decentralisation. Strathclyde region is developing its programme and setting up area committees which have extensive powers. That is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was involved in Renfrew district council, it was at the forefront of those councils which decentralised. There is a lesson that local authorities and councillors in particular will have to bear in mind, even if the amendment is accepted: councils' chief officers do not always support decentralisation. When we introduced a plan to decentralise services, many chief officers were downright obstructive. They had to be told that the tail was not going to wag the dog and that we would pursue the decentralisation programme. By contrast to the obstruction of some chief officers, who lost the battle, we received overwhelming support from the community, which perceived decentralisation as a welcome initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my time in local government, I learnt some lessons, which I shall apply to our discussion of the amendments. Decentralisation must mean more than administrative decentralisation. That is why amendments Nos. 219 and 220 are important. If the role of community activists and community organisations is not made clear in the Bill, it will be possible for a council to devise a scheme for administrative decentralisation alone. That is not an extension of democracy. It transfers powers downwards, but to non-elected officers—people who are appointed, not elected. If decentralisation is to be effective, it must mean a genuine shift and sharing of power. It must not simply mean moving power down the management structure of a council. Area committees should be more than advisory bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed community councils earlier in our proceedings. Many do not have a role that they can get their teeth into. The effect of community councils is variable. They do not have many statutory roles. Area committees must be given clearly defined, genuine, devolved power so that they can make decisions and are not constrained to refer matters to a council, which has the last say. Checks and balances must exist, however, it is essential for a council to provide a framework in which the role of community groups and area committees is clearly defined. Without such a framework, some dangers will exist. For example, when we established area committees in the Renfrew district, one area committee told us that it did not want more homeless people, especially homeless single parents, to be allocated to its area. A framework must be established to prevent such occurrences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
Amendments Nos. 219 and 212 cover community involvement. My hon. Friend for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that community councils had a powerful role to perform. I agree. We should not forget that community councils are statutory bodies. They have not received enough power, but they have been given a role to ascertain, co-ordinate and express the views of the community that they represent. As statutory bodies, they deserve to be consulted. Community councils can represent 200 people or 20,000 or 30,000 people. We shall have to consider how those differences can fit into a decentralisation scheme. If community groups are to be involved in a genuine power-sharing exercise, they must be properly constituted. We are always coming across examples of community groups that do not have annual general meetings or in which the office bearers run a tight ship in an attempt to ensure that no one else is involved. The groups must be genuinely constituted and open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community groups must also be prepared to shift and share power with other people in the community. Most of us who have experience of decentralisation schemes in which community councils have become involved know that they have often not attempted to involve other members of the community. That is dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that this suggestion cannot be included in the Bill, but I hope that the Minister will consider decentralisation schemes with integration between the cycle of community council and other community group meetings and the committee cycle of the council. Area committees are consulted and asked for their opinion but often by the time they have responded to the council, the council has already taken a decision. There must be local integration. If that means a cycle of meetings in which community councils meet in one fortnight so that they can report to area committees the following week, which can report to the council the week after, that is what we should put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak on this with the authority of a former chairman of Johnstone community council, which covers a population of 24,000 people. I joined that council in 1980, and I cut my political teeth there. It was quite a political council. I still attend meetings when I can and, taking a lead from my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, I shall make a reselection speech. The community council is ably organised by Margaret Harkins.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Margaret Harkins?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She is the chair of Paisley, South constituency Labour party. That is a fleeting reference and I shall not dwell on it. However, people such as Joe Kerr, Dan Harkins, Eddie Bennett and Sandy Young are good people and they are involved with that community council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister does not listen to the views of community councils, but one of the best community council chairmen in the area is Gilbert Baird of Barrhead. Although the Minister does not agree with him on this issue, I know that he has great respect for Gilbert Baird.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community councils throughout Renfrew district are involved in many worthwhile schemes. In Elderslie, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
community council is trying to bring Elderslie east church, which is in a state of dereliction, back into use by bringing the various authorities together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants groups should also be involved in the process. They know the housing problems in a particular area. Elected members at whatever level are used to getting people along to meetings to argue that they should have a bigger slice of the cake. That is particular true of housing where people ask for a bigger share to deal with housing problems. That approach is understandable and we represent those people to the best of our abilities. However, where there is genuine consultation and devolution of decision making so that people become involved, a sense of responsibilty goes with the power. When people are sitting around a table arguing for their own area, they realise that they have to make a case before people who are arguing the case for other areas. A healthy democracy comes out of that. Instead of tenants groups fighting each other or fighting the council, a partnership develops in which they understand each other's problems and how money and resources should be allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister with responsibility for education and housing will remember a visit that he paid to the Foxbar Rivers area of Paisley. The community there was working hard and was much involved in local events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I referred to the elderly forums set up by Strathclyde regional council, which have been an excellent initiative. Before they were set up, senior citizens were involved in social clubs and tea clubs. I make no criticism of that activity: such clubs have an important role that I would not knock. But senior citizens do not seem to be allowed to be involved in effective campaigning. Strathclyde encouraged them to get involved and use their muscle to get things done for elderly people. That initiative has been excellent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite just two examples: Bill Thompson in Paisley and Bill Lennon in Johnstone are both elderly gentlemen, but the energy that they put into the local community would put some of us to shame. Moreover, their experience is deep and broad, and one can always turn to them for advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are too many groups to name, but I wish to speak about the groups involving disabled people. My presence in the Committee this evening means that I am missing a very important meeting of the all-party disablement group, of which I am secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am missing that meeting too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know that other hon. Members are in the same position. Members of that group know that disabled people are fed up of being done unto. That knowledge is shared by hon. Members of all parties: the hon. Member for Tayside, North sponsored last year's Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. However, we shall see in the debate on 11 March how much support there is for that measure among Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
Disabled people want to be involved as full and equal citizens. As my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley suggested, that constituency of interest would be valuable in any area committee that is established. However, its value would not be restricted to examining the services—involving access or housing need, for example—provided for disabled people. Disabled people also would be able to make a contribution for others in the community. They might be members of an area committee because of their single interest, but their contribution would extend far wider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 220 deals with administrative support. I hope that we are beginning to convince the Minister, The amendment's purpose is genuine and would not damage the Bill. The Bill could only be improved if it were accepted. To be effective, area committees must have administrative back up. That means clerical support to handle correspondence when a committee decides to act. Another implication is that those committees need access to a person at a senior level who can get things done. One of the lessons that we learnt in Renfrew district when we set up the area committees was that the grade of officers seconded to those committees—good, dedicated people who worked hard—had to refer matters to the relevant service directors, whether it be planning, sports and leisure or some other service. The area officers had to negotiate with their bosses to get things done for the area committee to which they were accountable. Thus they fell between two stools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our solution was to allocate a service director to each of the area committees, which then had a person at the top level of corporate management who was responsible for taking matters forward. That worked very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decentralisation scheme refers to the need for local offices to deliver local services. The greatest attribute of people in local offices is their common sense. They do not get bound up in bureaucracy. There is a simple reason for that: unlike people in headquarters, they do not drive into an area, observe the problem and then drive out. People in local offices are more likely to walk around and discover the problem, and if they do not solve it they will incur the wrath of constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know an excellent neighbourhood housing manager called Jim Devine. When he moved to the Johnstone Castle area about 3 or 4 per cent. of the houses were empty. The council had drawn up policies to try to deal with that problem Jim Devine looked at the computer list of people waiting for houses and at the list of empty houses and he realised that if the computer matched people with any of those empty houses it was merely a coincidence if they got what they had asked for. He had a common sense approach. He put the people at the top of the list in his car, drove them round the empty houses and let them choose the one that they would most like to be offered. In that way, he reduced the number of empty houses to less than 1 per cent. within a couple of months. That figure has stayed the same ever since. In that area office houses are often allocated even before they become empty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local offices are to be effective, they must have the flexibility to be able to use common sense. They must also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
be accountable to local people and must work within a policy framework determined by the council. Although I am for a maximum, genuine devolution of power to communities, there must also be accountability to the people who are directly and democratically elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am minded to conclude my contribution. [Hon. Members: "Oh"] well I know that the minister is disappointed, but last time I spoke for only a few minutes and he criticised me and said that it was unusual for a Whip to speak. I thought that I would keep my speech very brief today. I am sorry that the Minister is so disappointed, but I do not want him to accuse me of filibustering, because I find that abhorrent and I would not be involved in it. I hope that we have helped to convince the Minister that these are good amendments. If he is genuine about the clause, he should have no difficulty in accepting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is one of the most important clauses in the Bill for rural areas. The area of Scotland that I know best is the south-east. The success of the Bill will centre on the establishment of successful schemes for decentralisation and the involvement of community groups and community councils, as proposed in amendments Nos. 219, 220 and 212.

I was disappointed that the Minister was unable to give us a little more guidance on the type of schemes that we thought would be appropriate. On other clauses the Minister has said that the Government want to remain flexible. I understand the importance of retaining flexibility, because that maximises discretion at local council level. There are no decentralisation schemes in council areas such as south-east Scotland and the Borders region, nor have any been planned. Relations between the regional and district councils have, by and large, been good and so have relations between those councils and community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are embarking on a completely new prospectus with little idea of the options that the Government have in mind. A system with a thorough-going decentralisation scheme would return us to the previous position. People in towns such as Duns, Kelso and Jedburgh, former royal burghs and market towns in the Borders and similar areas, have a sentimental attachment to the old town councils. The town clerk or the chairman of the local town council could be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provost. Let us get it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said the provost. He could be contacted during the weekend when people were shopping or taking part in some other activity in the area. That is the kind of local attachment to which decentralisation schemes should return. The amendments would help to bring that about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be happier if I had a better idea of the options that the Government have in mind. We should have a clearer idea of the Government's plans for finance. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
Minister spoke earlier about local levels of finance. An extensive decentralisation scheme could not possibly be carried out at nil cost. Information technology would be needed, with local access to centrally held files. Such computer systems cost money but they would improve communication, which is essential if decentralisation is to be worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked some apposite and penetrating questions about the additional costs of information technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must accept that if the schemes are to be implemented and amendments Nos. 219, 220 and 212 embraced some allowance must be made for costs. Good schemes would pay dividends in terms of effective decentralisation. The Government should therefore consider helping to implement the new local councils' plans for decentralisation during the transitional three-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some schemes embrace financial devolution—budgets and budget planning—to area committees, the groups mentioned in amendment No. 219 would have access to budgeting and planning decisions. Would the Government consider that an appropriate decentralisation scheme or would they think that the councils were going too far to meet centrally set policy guidelines and standards? It would ensure that the framework was in place and budgets as well as other responsibilities could be devolved to area committees in, for example, the former royal burghs in the new local government system. For example, among the community groups that amendment No. 219 might embrace could be committees that are set up to administer the common good funds. I know that several organisations, working parties and the like, operate at a decentralised level.

However, I am being tempted away from the point that I am trying to make, which is directly relevant to the amendments. I should hope that organisations or community groups that run, for example, common good funds—or Common Ridings—would be consulted in any effective decentralisation scheme. Does the Minister consider that the administration of common good funds could be embraced or countenanced during the consideration of the amendments?

I shall now argue against myself—which, as I am sure you know, Sir James, is a good Liberal tradition. I listened carefully to the speech my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, because I know that he is an expert on voluntary organisations, in particular Age Concern, but I received representations from people involved in a similar sphere who told me that in a really decentralised context they sometimes find it more difficult to relate to the local authority. In Strathclyde at present they would have to make representations to and receive an answer from one council. They need make only one approach regarding budgets or funding. After Strathclyde is taken out of the picture by the Bill, such people with have to approach a far greater number of councils. Not only that, but if those councils are also extensively decentralised, it will be necessary to approach the right decentralised level to obtain finance and other support. We must take care not to land voluntary organisations such as Age Concern, which have enough difficulty now trying to solicit funds from statutory bodies, with the additional difficulty of having to run around more committees and organisations to get support. There is a balance to be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the spirit, if not the fine print, of all the amendments. I hope that the Minister will pay more attention to them than he has done so far, but more than anything I hope that he will find some way during our proceedings to put more flesh on the bones of the schemes that he has in mind. For my money, the way in which the clause is implemented in my area of south-east Scotland will bear closely on the success or otherwise of the Bill. It is as serious as that. The clause is a cardinal part of the reforms and if the Borders council that will be set up in 1966 is to succeed, the spirit enshrined in the amendments must be realised. The Government have a responsibility to do that. It is not enough for them to say that they will set up flexible schemes at no cost and leave councils to do the rest. That is nothing like good enough, and I hope that the Minister will give us concrete assurances on that point and on others raised in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise the decentralisation concerns of three groups. I refer to librarians, archaeologists and civil engineers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (3) and (6)(b) require councils not only to draw up decentralisation schemes but disseminate information about them. The Scottish Library Association, which represents more than 2,000 librarians and information specialists, is anxious that full use should be made of public libraries for publicising council services. Normally, neither Parliament nor the Government would lay down how such information ought to be made public. Clause 23 is unusual in that it intervenes in the internal workings of councils, and justifies raising matters with Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9) allows the Secretary of State to issue guidance to councils on the form and content of decentralisation schemes. The schemes will presumably contain provisions about where information on council services can be obtained. I refer to subsection (2)(d). Will
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
the Secretary of State include in his guidance anything about the desirability of making use of public libraries for that purpose? If I dare say so without treading on eggshells, he might introduce a Cunningham amendment on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Libraries have a long tradition of providing information on a wide range of services offered by national and local agencies. They have trained information staff and, in many cases, the technology to allow access to local and national data bases. They have service points in most centres of population. In rural areas, they are often the only form of local authority presence and their facilities tend to be open to the public much longer than other local authority services. Public libraries would therefore be the natural vehicle for providing the information required by clause 23. To use any other vehicle would entail major costs. Does the Minister agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, the Scottish Library Association hopes that the Secretary of State will include in his guidance the desirability of using the public library service for that purpose. The amendment may be more acceptable than it would have been some years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a great deal to do with the Council for Scottish Archaelogy regarding the battle of Cairnpapple where, together in front of the concrete mixers, we saved the most important bronze age site on the Scottish mainland. Incidentally, I have also had much to do with the Scottish Library Association and its secretary, Mr. George Cunningham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Bill Hanson, president of the Council for Scottish Archaeology wrote to me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"CSA is much concerned that the hard efforts of the archaeological community over several years to persuade regional authorities to appoint archaeologists within their planning teams will be completely undermined by the proposed reforms. A proliferation of smaller authorities will be less likely to see the need for, or indeed have the finances, such appointments, particularly as archaeological provision is not a statutory obligation."</p></blockquote>
Dr. Hanson told me that a motion will be presented to the annual general meeting. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CSA seeks reassurance from the Secretary of State for Scotland that adequate archaeological provision will be made at local authority level in the proposed reform of local government, and urges that this provision be a statutory obligation."</p></blockquote>
Can such an assurance be given? Has the Minister any further comments to make after consultation with Graham Munro and David Breeze of Historic Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third anxiety relates to another organisation with which I am familiar—the Institution of Civil Engineers. The official view of its secretary, Mr. Mitchell, is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst the principle … of improving devolvement of information and access to local services is recognised there is concern as to the loss of appropriate technical/professional support to such devolved services. Such support cannot be sensibly devolved to ensure the continued provision of strategic management and with a resultant loss in economies of scale in operation and the provision of specialist services.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The integrity and accountability in service provision is also questionable if the solution of joint boards or other non-local authority accountable organisations are pursued."</p></blockquote>
I am worried about the protection of specialist services, not least specialist planning services. Regional councils—especially, Lothian, Strathclyde and Tayside—are major contributors of specialist planning services. That contribution is widely acknowledged. Professional planning teams for environmental action in many spheres provide those services. How will they be provided in future? How will transfer arrangements be conducted to ensure that the loss of specialist services does not occur?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director of finance in Strathclyde, Archy Gillespie, said that we should understand that a critical mass exists. If the number of people employed falls below that mass, new ideas and plans will not be effected. That is why I am an ardent proponent of the regions. I hope that at the 11th hour and 59th minute, the regions will not be broken up. That would be the height of folly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fifteen or 16 years ago, the critical mass was about 40 per cent. If certain people had not done certain things, we would not be debating local government reorganisation now. I am alarmed by the prospect of a rerun of the Dalyell-Cunningham axis, but I agree with my hon. Friend's specific points—especially his point about the valuable function of local libraries in any decentralisation scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow said that local libraries would be the natural vehicle for decentralisation. In constituencies such as mine, they are literally vehicles because many libraries are mobile libraries. Many of the responses in the campaign against the Government's proposals to split up East Lothian came through local and mobile libraries in East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not by nature a suspicious man, but when those based in Whitehall suggest that other organisations should decentralise, I become very suspicious. The Scottish Office is probably the most shuttered, cloistered and non-accountable Department in the Government, yet it tells local authorities in Scotland to decentralise. Like motherhood, one knows that it is a good thing. I would to God that the Scottish Office set about a spot of decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am becoming increasingly confused about where the Government are going with the Bill. We were told that we would be summoned to the Committee to discuss legislation to create single-tier local authorities and to do away with different tiers and confusion. The previous debate was about creating joint boards. That is one tier, in addition to the fundamental authorities. We are now discussing decentralised sub-committees, which is another tier. That is a little difficult to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, joint boards are body corporates. Does that mean that the clause applies to joint boards or to the councils, which are the constituent members of joint boards? Which would be responsible for introducing decentralisation schemes for those joint boards? If they could not agree, what recourse
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
would they have to reaching agreement—or would an agreement be forced on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Heaven knows. The Bill introduces a weird disparity of different types of authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred to the massive scale of Highland council—which, according to one consultation document, covers 2,540,000 hectares. That clearly needs decentralising. At the other end of the scale, the East Renfrewshire authority covers 11,500 hectares. Decentralisation of the Highlands is different from that of East Renfrewshire, and the decentralisation of joint boards is yet another matter. My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to that odd proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have misgivings about these matters which should be explored further. The clause provides for consultation. Voluntary organisations are weary of being consulted in the certain knowledge that their opinions will be treated with contempt. Some in my constituency went to much trouble to express their views on whether the local health service should be handed over to a trust and also on this Bill. The Scottish Office ignored everyone of those views. There is much weariness and even cynicism among voluntary organisations about being consulted by a Government who seem merely to pay lip service to consulting those who provide services and who run voluntary organisations in the community when Government have no intention of paying attention to what is said. The degree of cynicism that the Government have bred in Scotland is disturbing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elected local authorities are keen to do the job properly and they have a good track record, as my hon. Friend the Memberfor Linlithgow said repeatedly. I wonder whether the amendments are targeted, because Scottish local authorities have an excellent record of consulting and helping to establish voluntary organisations. Perhaps there should not be a targeting of consultation at local authorities, but at the Scottish Office. We should consider aspects of the valuable work done by voluntary organisations around Scotland. My hon. Friends have done that in relation to their areas, and I shall make similar points about the work of voluntary organisations in my constituency under the umbrella of the East Lothian voluntary organisations network, which does excellent work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a range of bodies, many of which would not exist or could not undertake their excellent work but for sponsorship and help from Lothian regional council officials. ELCAP—the East Lothian care and accommodation project—organises care in the community and provides accommodation for handicapped people. It is funded and comprehensively supported by both local authorities in my area. By all means consult it, but we are in a chicken and egg situation. It would not exist but for the work of Lothian region and East Lothian district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend and want to draw attention to the less than popular causes that Lothian region has supported. Stephen Maxwell's brief from the voluntary organisations states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"There may be a loss of commitment to some of the less popular clients of social work services, such as ex-offenders, drug users and people with mental health problems."</p></blockquote>
Many of us are anxious about such less than popular causes and applaud Lothian region for its excellent work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. There is a long list of such organisations which could be in danger as a consequence of the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voluntary East Lothian Housing Association would not exist but for the commitment of the local authorities to promoting it to help to make available more houses to let. Lunch clubs are promoted by the regional social work department. There is a citizens advice bureau as well as sports clubs and environmental organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to community education. A couple of weeks ago I visited the Countess youth centre in Dunbar. It is a small organisation with the problems of property and of finance that such bodies suffer. The Lothian region community education department has stepped in to help to work out its difficulties. A member of staff is now based at the centre, which is on the periphery of Lothian region, and doing excellent work to enable the project to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of our local authorities on consulting, promoting and working with voluntary organisations is second to none. We can be confident that our local authorities will continue to work with the organisations, but I am suspicious about the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly pleased that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) is in his place. I noticed that he had a question on the Order Paper today. He is fortunate he tabled a question to the saintly Secretary of State for the Environment yesterday and, would you believe it, Sir James, The Secretary of State took time off from his spiritual journey to reply today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman appropriately asked about consultations on the conduct of the review of local government as it affects all sorts of organisations in his constituency. The Secretary of State's reply relates to the amendment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Representations have been made to me by local authorities in Gloucestershire that they should be given the opportunity to make fresh proposals on the basis of the new guidance. I consider that the local authorities and people of the area ought to be given that chance.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 1 March 1994; Vol. 238, c.643.]</p></blockquote>
That is in relation to the conduct of the review of the local government structure in Gloucestershire. The Secretary of State states that he would make provision for the people and voluntary organisations of Gloucestershire to have their say on the structure of local government. But, apparently regardless of what is good for Gloucestershire, the hon. Member for Stroud is quite happy to impose his party's will. Regardless of the views of communities and the interests of voluntary organisations in Scotland, he is happy to ram the Bill down our throats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
I strongly support the principle of the amendment. I am profoundly suspicious of the Government's intention to impose conditions for decentralisation on local authorities in Scotland. We are in favour of the principle, but we do not trust the Secretary of State to carry it out in a fair and equitable manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more I listen to the debate, the more discouraged I feel. Clause 23 is a key clause in the Bill, yet it is surrounded by vagueness and unsureness of purpose. If the Government really want nationally-instituted decentralisation, why was there no equivalent of the Paterson report—thinking through agreed principles of decentralisation and suggesting models that councils could follow in implementation? Instead of that the Government shunt local authorities in a certain direction and then back off from the consequences and details of decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decentralisation should be at the heart of local government and should be what makes it truly local, which is why the debate is important. It is vital that decentralisation is genuine. The amendments are a consequence of the deficiencies of the Government's original proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government plans specifically mention full council and departmental meetings, which would move locations. They envisage area committees with specified functions and council offices spread about the area and council advice offices, which probably already exist in Scotland. They envisage consultation with community councils, but that is not new: it already happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main change that the Government propose concerns council meetings and area committees. The rest already exist in Scotland. The Government want the council meetings to be held in different locations, which is apparently what they mean by decentralisation beyond that which exists. Local authorities have been in the decentralising business for years, and are well ahead of the Government in the provision of local offices and services. Conscious efforts have been made to establish local contracts and receive local views. I know because I have been part of local government and have seen that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Goverment are behind local government on decentralisation, which explains the vagueness of the Government's proposals and the necessity for the Opposition to tighten up and clarify them. The clause purports to offer decentralisaton of local government, but that is not what it delivers. It contains the illusion of decentralisation, but not the reality. The Government are using the clause as a front and a desirable goal, but not as one to be reached, and certainly not by the Government. Decentralisation takes its place alongside community care and the Child Support Agency. They are admirable ideas, supported by all parties in principle, but the problem is how to deliver the agreed benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been agreement about the desirability of decentralisation but on the other matters, there have been acute differences of opinion as to what community care or the Child Support Agency mean in reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
Decentralisation may take place in similar circumstances to community care. If the Government want decentralisation to work, it will require more finance and resources, not less, which is the Government's intention. Decentralisation will not work as part of a penny-pinching exercise. The Government say that they want more local offices, meetings and activities. By definition, that must mean more expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Failure to deliver extra local staff offices and local activities will mean failure to deliver the Government's stated aim of decentralisation. Existing failures to deliver such facilities have appeared in the parallel spheres that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The location of council offices mirrors the position in most areas. Therefore, decentralisation will be illusory if that is all the Government have to offer. People will receive advice, but the Bill will take power from them. Some elected councillors and many citizens will be banned by the Government from even standing for office in their councils. Offices offering advice are hardly a substitute for democratic decision-making powers, which is what decentralisation should be about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Genuinely devolved local government would allow more powers for decision making at local level. That is what the amendments would provide. As in Europe, subsidiarity is not a principle that the Government embrace. For them, it starts in Brussels and ends in London, and the Bill mirrors that thinking. The Government are advocating for local authorities a policy that they have no intention of delivering. They run one of the most centralised, closed systems of Government in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the logistics of the Government's scheme? The Bill sets out the general direction it wants local authorities to follow, so I presume that it is a model of what the Government want. If councils are peripatetic and they move from one centre to another, that will automatically mean moving people, equipment, the necessary bureaucracy and officials, with all the extra expense and problems that that involves. They will be doing what gives rise to the major complaint against the European Parliament, and what the United Kingdom Government will not do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such shifting about will create fewer locational problems in councils where the old burgh chambers still exist and it could keep former district council chambers in sporadic use. But what about the cities? For example, in Glasgow, will the council be expected to meet occasionally in Govan or Partick borough halls? That is no bad thing, but how would it work in practice without a substantial increase in costs for a local government system to which the Government are offering no extra cash? No extra money will be available for services. That is the illusion of decentralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that it is not only an illusion of decentralisation, but a false premise? If the Government want council committees to
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
move around, this Committee could meet in every local authority chamber in Scotland. We could then debate the future for local government in Scotland at its heart. The Minister and the Government have no intention of allowing the Committee to be exposed to the expert gaze of people who know about local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thoroughly agree. The hon. Gentleman's common sense remarks will probably cause apoplexy on the Government Benches—if they think about them. Such a move would be a true example of decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want fragmentation rather than decentralisation. Much depends on area committees and whether they become genuine local points of input or simply turn into local fiefdoms, which were the worst aspects of the old country council system. I do not want a return to that set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are offering fake decentralisation. The giveaway is to be found in subsections (9) and (10). The Government talk of devolved government, and follow that with the Secretary of State's centralising power to "issue guidance" and to force councils to "take account of" his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsections reveal a hankering after control by the Government rather than by local authorities. Were they true to form, they might have included the customary "The Secretary of State shall by order", which appears throughout the Bill as the Government's customary stance. The people should be given genuine power over local decision making but instead are offered advice shops, and the number of their elected councillors is being reduced. That is the opposite of decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 23 is not about meaningful decentralisation. It is a smokescreen, and will soon be seen as such. I should like the Minister to justify the clause. The word "shall" denotes that something is compulsory, but in the Bill it is followed by the word "may", which denotes that it is not. So, apparently, each council must, by law prepare decentralisation schemes and consult on them but they do not have to implement them. What are the Government doing? They are telling local authorities, "You shall prepare a scheme according to our view of decentralisation but you do not have to implement it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most councils already have decentralisation schemes above and beyond anything that the Government have in mind. Strathclyde, not one of the Government's favourite councils, is often cited by them as an example, in their view, of excess centralisation, yet Strathclyde has introduced the type of decentralised scheme that the Government prefer. Does the Minister have a word of praise for what Strathclyde has managed to.do in this sphere? I am told that it has set up 27 local committees that handle an annual budge of approximately £450 million. There is one such committee for east district—with eight for Glasgow. Local services managers have devolved budgets. They are delegated budgets that involve local discussion. Why does not the Minister trust local authorities, which know their own local business best? Why will he not allow them to get on with their business?

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
What are the Government trying to achieve with the clause? Are present councils so centralised that it is essential such a measure be in statute? If so, will the Minister name them so that we can judge the wisdom or otherwise of insisting on including clause 23 in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I favour decentralisation, which I believe has been happening anyway in Scottish local authorities, but I want the Minister to justify the Bill's provisions. The Opposition are trying to put flesh on the bones of the Bill, to turn it into reality and give actual power to the people. The Government are offering a large smokescreen for what is called decentralisation but what, in practice, is anything but. I look forward to hearing the Minister justify the provisions. I want a decentralised system, but that is not what the Government are offering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If it is your ruling that there will not be a clause stand part debate can you clarify whether we can enter into the debate again when my hon. Friend the Member for Govan has finished speaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two more groups of amendments and I fear, or rather I should say I know, that hon. Gentlemen will have an opportunity to touch on matters that they may not be able to touch on if whoever is in the Chair does not allow a stand part debate. But it is up to the Chair to decide and announce that without any prior warning. I was just being courteous to the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
as he was being courteous to the Chair. I was impressed by the range of debate that took place this afternoon. I did not have the benefit of being in the Chair for the morning, when I am sure that my co-Chairman listened to a similarly wide-ranging debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James. I shall restrict myself to the amendments. I hope to return on a later group to deal with some other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to start by arguing the case for amendment No. 219 in the context of seeking to establish an educated electorate. It is extremely important that we try to ensure that as many of our voters as possible are aware of the genuine difficulties faced by local authorities and have full information on the range of choices and alternatives that face them. They need an understanding of how priorities are determined and how the limited amount of available finance is focused on the priorities, in line with the political philosophy of those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main difficulties in local authorities at present is that there is a belief that money has no finite limits. People expect that the local authority should be able to undertake everything that they want done. There is no willingness to recognise that there are greater priorities than those wanted by the individual constituent. There is no understanding of the framework within which the whole system is operating. If a structure is established, it should go beyond the community councils to make sure that the widest possible range of community groups and organisations is involved so that structured debate and discussion can take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall my own experience, not only as a local councillor in Govan but as the chair of education in Strathclyde. We had a series of meetings, deliberately held to explain to people the difficulties faced by the education authority, in particular. We explained the constraints on us as a result of Government financial measures. He explained our statutory responsibilities and how each had been costed, and then outlined the areas of discretion that remained to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that, we used to have serious and wide-ranging debates about the priorities that the council should have in those circumstances They were good debates. People left them at least understanding—even if they had not got their own way—that the council was following rational decision-making processes and had a system. Even if people did not agree with the priorities, they recognised that there was no arbitrariness in how spending was determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to establish that kind of structure at a local level, by involving in the debates and discussions the widest range of organisations and, in some, instances, individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AmendmentNo. 219 is especially appropriate. It clearly shows that we want.
	<br><blockquote><p>"representatives of community groups in each area to participate in the deliberations of committees".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
I have discussed priorities. There is also the matter of explaining why individual councils face financial difficulties. Again, there is great disillusionment with local authorities because people inadequately understand the authorities' financial difficulties. Discussions and debate that explain where responsibility lies would help people to know that and to know who should get the blame and would also allow the exploration of alternative solutions to problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area, I was impressed by how, for example, the local grants committee and other organisations that had small amounts of money available for disbursement could draw on the experience of people who were active in the local community to devise intelligent and novel solutions to difficulties. In many circumstances, they were able to break new ground. Often, they would try new solutions that did not work. In the context of decentralisation, it must be accepted that not every effort will be successful. The message must go out from local authorities and from central Government not that we welcome but that we expect failure—we expect that many initiatives will not bear fruit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One current difficulty in local government is the fear of failure. The emphasis is on not getting things wrong and on not causing difficulties for the authority. If we are prepared to say that we want not quite 1,000 flowers to bloom, but different ways to be explored so that other areas can learn from the successes and failures of their compatriots, it would benefit the local authority system. That means having a decentralised structure that draws in the widest range of groups and organisations, beyond simply the community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make it clear that we want decentralised structures and not simply, as it were, as mini-councils with agendas the length of full council agendas, covering the whole range of council services. We want to give those structures the opportunity to focus on, say, one, two, three or four problems at the expense, if necessary, of discussion of other topics. We hope that responsive councils, as many of our councils in Scotland have become in the past few years—many were always that way but many have improved—will continue to provide the majority of their services in a customer-focused and responsive manner, but will pay particular attention to those initiatives that local groups and organisations consider to be significant and important. For example, one area in my constituency has a particular drug problem, in addition toavarietyof other problems. Over a long period of voluntary activity, they have identified that drugs, their misuse and the associated problems of crime, truancy, and so on, should be tackled. I think that those individuals there would not want to take up with the same immediacy issues, say, of child care of provision for the elderly. They see drugs as the main problem in their community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a decentralisation scheme that allows a focus on particular difficulties that they identify. We must allow individuals to select their own priorities and ensure that there is no blueprint involving set agendas, structures and systems through which they must go. By all means, let us provide them with staff support and frameworks from which they can choose to depart. It is important that we do
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
not place them in a straitjacket similar to that which confines many of our local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 200 deals with officers and administrative arrangements for supporting the actions of the committees. Many people are prepared to undertake a degree of voluntary work and effort in their local community and to involve themselves in it in a helpful and constructive way. However, the vast majority do not want to spend all their time in committees. That was the fallacy at the root of the point made by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who are prepared to volunteer do not want to be councillors, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley noted. They do not join committees to get bogged down with obligations invoving arranging the distribution of papers, writing minutes and reports, assessing needs and so on. They want part of the job to be done for them, in a sense, so that they can be involved in the meat of the activity. Many people who get involved will be fortunate to have paid employment and already will have committed substantial parts of their day to that employment. Many have families. They have a limited amount of time to devote to voluntary activities supporting the community and to contribute their skills and knowledge to the betterment of their neighbourhood. They do not want to spend that time talking on committees. They want to make sure that time is usefully concentrated. That requires a substantial degree of administrative support and professional advice. The demands that will place on the local authority are significant and should not be underestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Government have given no indication of the cost of the decentralisatoin initiative. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide an estimate by the end of the evening, so that we can take the debate on costs further. We would then have a clear indication of the scale of the professional and administrative support that the Government intend. I worry that the nice noises and slogans trotted out by the Government will not amount to more than a row of beans, when the question of whether they are prepared to pay arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, no financial boost is to be given to local authorities as a result of the reorganisation. Presumably, all the costs of the initiative—which will include administrative support, paying for meeting places, the necessary paperwork and professional support, reports that may have to be a commissioned, and the transport needed to bring people from several of the decentralisation initiatives so that they may share experiences—will have to come from existing service provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the scheme is to be implemented well and adequately, those costs will be substantial. The Government must indicate that they are prepared to add a certain amount of finance to the pot, to make the scheme a reality. Otherwise, the Government will be seen merely to be paying lip service to the concept of decentralisation. In the absence of extra finance, the Government will merely establish a structure and system that meets the letter of the Bill but which does not implement it with any degree of will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>743</span>
The Government have always been keen to recruit volunteers, as have I and the vast majority of Opposition Members. I have always held reservations about the Government's commitment to volunteers and volunteering, which they have seen as a substitute for paid staff rather than as an addition. We want additionality from volunteers rather than substitution. The injection of a substantial amount of money overall—although a relatively limited amount in particular areas—will provide an enormous opportunity to gain substantial added value, by drawing many more volunteers into a wider range of activities than has previously been possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my hon. Friends spoke in glowing terms about individuals and groups in their areas. I will not repeat the names that they mentioned. The Lady in Drongan who received the MBE springs to mind, but there were many others. The mother of my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley—she deserves a medal for that alone—does a great deal of good work as well. It is not just a question of individuals who are already part of the process. If volunteers who are involved in these committees and structures are elevated by that experience, they in turn will draw in more people—which will allow expansion into areas of public service that are perhaps not available at the moment because of costs, and would allow the provision of better public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investment required in amendment No. 220 would repay us 20, 30 or 40-fold because we would have the time, expertise, abilities and talents of the volunteers that we could recruit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to grant funding and the involvement of local groups and organisations in examing funds and grants to local organisations, as one of my hon. Friends mentioned that has been one of the great successes in Strathclyde. I understand from hon. Friends that is true in other parts of the country. It is significant that many groups and organisations have been involved in self-assessment of grant applications. They have been able to determine which grants had a lower priority and where money was being spent adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many groups in my area, aware that money was tight, voluntarily collaborated to share equipment such as typewriters and computers. They bought steel cupboards in which to store some of their equipment in order to keep it for themselves, but they were prepared to share many other pieces of equipment. That is a large step forward, because many organisations had struggled on with limited equipment that they kept to themselves, and were not willing to co-operate and share. The examination of each other's applications resulted in them collaborating in a way that could not have been foreseen previously. That should be welcomed and encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that his excellent local councillors had large-format cheques, which he was right to say I had pioneered in my time as chair of Strathclyde region. They were useful not only for councils and for the groups that received those cheques but in advertising the grant
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
scheme. Once people saw the potential to obtain limited grants for good works in the community, a flood of organisations considered possibilities that had never previously entered their heads. Their eyes were opened to opportunities that they had never considered. They saw work that they could undertake with relatively modest amounts of pump priming, so were prepared to present proposals after exploring the possibilities. That was the creative part of the exercise. Many people were drawn into those discussions who would not otherwise have been involved, not realising that they had an opportunity to break out of the cycle of poverty and depravation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one lives in an area where the vast majority of the population are on benefits and those employed are in low-paid work, there is not even the money in the community to run jumble sales and raffles to raise funds. Such areas are where a decentralised grants system works at its best. It draws the best out of people and allows them to copy examples in a way that is constructive and positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will briefly address the question of how organisations should be selected. I am minded of the decentralisation initiative taken by an education authority regarding halls. It involved a large community hall that decided in a spirit of democracy, that it would throw itself open to become a one person, one vote structure. Whoever turned up would get a vote. They elected the committee, and that is an admirable concept. We know why people support it in theory, but the largest single group—the sequence dancers—took over the running of the hall. That group decided that it did not want young people, who are known to be noisy individuals to be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the expert knowledge that my hon. Friend has of the voluntary sector, can he imagine why the Government are unwilling to accept the reasonable amendments? The voluntary sector and community groups make an excellent contribution to the quality of life. My hon. Friend the Minister for Govan said that they are doing an excellent job in his area, so why should we not encourage them further, by offering another level of participation? Why are the Government refusing to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a welcome question. There is a simple explanation—the Minister is a bad man.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the debate have finished many hours ago, if the Minister had accepted the three amendments?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, there is tremendous logic in that contribution for my hon. Friend. Does the Minister believe that the acceptance of the amendment would inevitably lead to the adoption of the proposal for a unitary Ayrshire authority? I cannot see that connection, but one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
never knows. The Government are anxious not to be seen performing U-turns, but I do not see why they cannot do them in Committee when they have done that everywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Government will not accept the amendments. Labour Members are strongly committed to the concept of involving the community in the affairs of councils, by making sure that it has the opportunity to contribute to the maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the issue of sequence dancing. Sequence dancers are an important group within the community and should have their interests genuinely reflected in the running of community facilities. The nature of that activity means that it takes place in large groups. At a meeting of the users of a hall, that group—which is usually made up of elderly people who are knowledgeable about the operation of committees—tends to outvote the other users of the facility. In those circumstances, it is necessary to make sure that any democratic structures to identify which representatives should be involved in systems that the council establishes do not get hijacked by one particular interest group. It is essential to ensure that a wide range of community groups have the opportunity to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, some of my hon. Friends identified a series of groups, organisations, structures and services that they thought would have something to contribute. I want to touch on one or two examples that would not work if they simply went through the community council system. Govan unemployed workers centre is an extremely important organisation in my constituency. It provides a facility for substantial numbers of organisations but has only one representative on the Govan community council. We understand why—one would not want a single interest group to overwhelm a community council. However, that individual—it is a him but it could be a her—has substantial responsibility for representing the various interests within the unemployed workers centre. Because of that, a member of the centre's staff serves on the community council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a missed opportunity: If only one, two or three representatives of the community council serve on the structure that the local authority establishes, it is natural that they would be lay people rather than paid staff. It is unlikely that a member of the staff from the centre would be chosen. That means that there would be no direct route by which the experience of the organisations in the unemployed workers centre could be used—for example the mother and family group, toddlers group, hill-walking group and cycling group have all involved in fundraising activities and, in many cases, draw young people at risk from drug misuse into activities in the centre. They would not be able to provide their input directly into a council structure that was solely restricted to community councils representatives. We need to throw the net more widely. Amendment Nos. 219 and 212 have phraseology that makes it clear that we want the net thrown more widely than statutory organisations, full-time staff and community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education, school boards and PTAs were mentioned earlier. They, too, have a substantial amount to contribute
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
to discussion and debate on not only education but other activities. The social difficulties of youngsters attending secondary schools are often well know to members of tenants' associations and school boards. They can make a valuable contribution to debates in a devolved structure about, say, drug misuse or the problems of policing an area. They see many of those problems at first hand, because of the impact of such difficulties on the school situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only by ensuring a blending of talents by throwing the net more widely shall we be able to make the most of the opportunities of a devolved, decentralised structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are substantial difficulties in looking after young people in the community, providing them with activities and ensuring that they do not fall into bad habits. We need to devise ways in which we can make best use of the plant and equipment as it were—buildings such as Govan high school in my constituency of St. Gerard's, which has only recently been saved from closure proposals by a tremendous, locally organised campaign. That campaign drew together a wide range of community organisations and groups, to work for a common goal. That relates to my earlier comments about focus. The community identifies its most important issue. To Govan, over the past six months or so, that was the preservation of secondary Catholic education. I shall return to that point in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From my hon. Friend's exposition, No. 220 would clearly help an excellent group of organisations do even better for their community. Obviously, the amendment has a significant bearing on the text of my hon. Friend's contribution. Does he agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. The campaign to save St. Gerard's is a particularly good example of how collaborating voluntary organisations would have been greatly assisted by the provision of officers and administrative arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider whether a local group would be provided with officers and administrative support for an activity such as a campaign, which might run contrary to the local authority's determined policy. The Minister has not commented on that issue yet. I am unclear whether support arrangements would be allowed to operate in circumstances in which the decentralised structure's policy was in conflict with a centrally determined policy of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not anticipate that the wide range of groups that I indicated in respect of amendment Nos. 219 and 212 would necessarily always want to be at loggerheads with the council, but there could be circumstances in which there was a degree of disagreement. We want clarification as to the extent to which the Minister believes that any decentralised structure should, in such circumstances, be free to express views that are contrary to the stated position of the relevant local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should ensure that individual decentralised structures would not be free to go off entirely on their own way. We would not want several hundred individual local authorities, each with a complete range of policies on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
schools, social work and roads. The trunk road building programme cannot be decentralised because that would result in roads running to the limits of particular areas only and not necessarily connecting with roads built by other decentralised units. I do not anticipate that they will have access to substantial amounts of capital funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, decentralised structures might have money to run campaigns and take initatives, that could be at variance with council policy. In such circumstances, the Minister has not explained the constraints that will be placed on the flexibility and freedom of decentralised structures to establish policies of their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that excellent point, does not my hon. Friend agree that the process explained in amendment No. 220 would allow the Government to be brought nearer to the people so that they can have a real say, rather than the type of market testing in the throwaway society that the Government would have us believe is the hallmark of this new reorganised local government system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was helpful, because it brings me to a point that I was going to raise later. The question of whether market testing should be an issue at the discretion of a local structure has not yet tested the minds of the Committee. If the local groups described in amendments Nos. 219 and 212 decide that they would prefer not to have services in their area market tested or contracted out, how could we mesh that with a policy that the council might have over opting out, market testing or anything similar?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would we deal with school examinations? That aspect exercised many of our minds not long ago. Could a local structure, under a decentralised system, decide that it would not have testing of children of certain ages in its area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that advice. I take it that I shall receive a response in time for the next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was discussing decentralisation and how a balance could be struck between the central strategic policies of an
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
authority and the adaptations that it might want to adopt at local level. I was exploring the question of market testing. It is possible that there might be a local structure or a local devolved committee that does not want to move to the market testing of, for example, the running of a community centre in its area. The Minister must clarify what he intends to happen in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If devolution is to be meaningful in such circumstances and if local organisations are to have genuine control of policy implementation and virement powers over finance, they must be involved in the management of resources such as staffing and the operation of buildings. That is where market testing of resource management and buildings plays a part. Local committees are entitled to clarification about the rules of virement that the Minister would allow them to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a balance to be struck between the strategic policies of an authority and the evolution that the Minister wants. It is not clear from anything that has been said or anything that I have read how the matter will be dealt with. The amendment's wording has been carefully chosen to ensure the maximum involvement of local groups, which in many ways makes the problem more acute because it is much more likely that a genuinely representative grouping of individuals and organisations will suggest the nature of the policy that they want to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to question the Minister about category B education grants. How should they be dealt with under the structures that we are discussing? He will be aware that category B involves a substantial degree of devolution to community groups and organisations, with 25 per cent. of the capital funding raised by the local organisations, 25 per cent. supplied by the local authority and 50 per cent. provided by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, there will be a danger during the reorganisation of a lack of continuity in policy formulation. Many groups work extremely hard to raise the 25 per cent. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will guarantee that pledges made by existing local authorities, which have prompted organisations to start raising money, will be honoured under the new system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that category B, which has been a constructive use of public and locally-raised money, continues to go forward. I would like it to be expanded. Category B is an example of decentralisation. It gives substantial power and influence to local organisations to determine the activities on which they will focus their fund-raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss the way in which the decentralisation initiative might affect the provision of gaelic, which has not been discussed by the Committee. Clearly,—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is becoming a clause stand part debate when we should be dealing with the amendment. Comment has been made about whether there will be a clause stand part debate. We cannot have that debate at the moment because the Committee must deal with the amendment and the hon. Gentleman must speak to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an exceptionally fair point and it relates to the point that you, Mr. Martin, possibly missed about the start of the sequence dancers. The gaelic communities in my authority area, Strathclyde, and in other areas are an important interest group which requires to be taken into account. We must ensure that the balance between its interests and those of the community as a whole is struck in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in amendments Nos. 219 and 212 are reasonable and I hope that the Minister can see his way to accepting them. We have had a substantial debate on the amendment and I do not want to continue if that would intrude on the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate started eleven and half hours ago.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to do so. The hon. Gentleman's bottle of water has put an extra fizz into his sedentary remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may interest the Minister to know that the bottle of water was not supplied to me. I had to take it from a Table in the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not suggest that the hon. Gentleman had acted in a way that was anything other than wholly proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the two sides of the Committee is limited. It is not in dispute that it would be appropriate for community groups to be involved with area committees, nor is it in dispute that it is reasonable for local authorities to consult voluntary or community organisations, as provided in amendment No. 212.

The sole and limited question for the Committee is whether it is right for the provisions to be in the Bill. That is all that our remarkably long debate is about.

Among many other things, the hon. Member for Linlithgow referred to "Private Eye". That did not seem to be directly related to the amendments.

I shall turn first to some detailed points raised by hon. Members. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is listening intently to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am hanging on every word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman made a short, constructive speech, I shall respond in detail to his points. He asked whether devolution of budgets would be an acceptable form of decentralisation and then asked specifically about the administration of common good funds. To answer his first question, there is nothing in principle against what he suggests, if that is the view of the local authority and other relevant bodies in the area. Appropriate financial control systems would have to operate, but that does not rule out the principle of the hon. Gentleman's suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respond to his second point in the same way: there is no problemin principle, if appropriate arrangements can be worked out, for the administration of common good funds to be undertaken by an area committee or a decentralised organisation set up by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a fair point about the importance of decentralisation, particularly in rural areas. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred specifically to the Highlands in that context. All hon. Members will have received a document from Highland regional council outlining its proposal for a very effective scheme of decentralisation as a new authority. As I recall, it argues that under its proposed scheme, only 10 per cent. of staff would remain at headquarters.

9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire spoke about the Borders regional council. It is the same point, and very relevant. I have the council's response to the second consultation document in which it makes precisely this point. It is worth emphasising, because it shows how seriously the council, which is not atypical of councils in Scotland, takes decentralisation. Paragraph 6.1 on page 12 of the document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rural nature and sparsity of population of the Borders requires additional involvement of local people in the affairs of the new council. At the same time this must be balanced against the danger of creating a new two-tier system or diluting the benefits of the economies of scale inherent in a single Borders council."</p></blockquote>
It continues in paragraph 6.2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The creation of a single-tier authority in the Borders would introduce a requirement to develop more effective links with the public. This requirement stems from the need to overcome the feelings of remoteness which exist in outlying rural areas and which were highlighted during the Regional Council's recent consultation with Community Councils on the issue of reorganistion."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
That short excerpt from the Borders response shows its commitment to decentralisation. It also highlights the need for a balanced approach, which the hon. Members for East Lothian and for Govan spoke about. I should like to develop that point for a moment in response to the hon. Member for Govan. In decentralising their functions, authorities will not want a clash with their overall strategy. A balance will need to be achieved. However, I do not believe that it is for the Government to be prescriptive or to lay down a blueprint. Local authorities should decide the details of schemes for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given two examples of submissions regarding decentralisation. Has there been the slightest hint in either submission that a significant increase in manpower would result from decentralisation and that the councils concerned therefore support the views expressed by several Opposition Mmebers; do they concur with the view of Conservative Members that decentralisation will achieve overall savings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I am reading through the Borders document. It is quite clear that no problems regarding financing the proposed system are envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister pay tribute to East Lothian district council for the way in which it has set about decentralising its services? Shop fronts have been established so that local authority services are easily accessible to the public in every part of the district. That inevitably costs money as, at the very least, staff must be employed and property and computer terminals must be maintained in many different places. In my constituency, that is Dunbar, East Linton, North Berwick, Tranent, Preston Pans, Port Seton and Musselburgh, as well as the district headquarters in Haddington. Of course that costs money and it is right that it should. I cannot see why the Minister should try to wriggle out of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to the issue of costs. Of course some decentralisation schemes will cost money—they do at present. I have never suggested otherwise. The Borders document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Someone going into a local office in any town or village should be able to obtain immediate access to information or assistance on the full range of council services."</p></blockquote>
That is the concept of the one-stop shop to which the hon. Member referred. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This accessibility could be enhanced by appropriate use of information technology, and supported by a network of public telephones offering simple, cheap access to council staff. This would be particularly valuable in areas where physical decentralisation of staff would not be cost effective."</p></blockquote>
That council is taking a sensible and rational approach. It is not suggesting a scheme that involves massive amounts of extra money. Some decentralisation schemes will involve extra expenditure, but I was making the point that there is a need to ensure cost effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister must accept that unless he decentralises those functions—be they all offices or one-stop shops as he described—it is bound to cost money to maintain the fabric of an office, quite apart from staffing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not listen. He obviously misunderstood the whole point of the clause. I am not proposing to decentralise anything. The clause is about local authorities decentralising their functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend's example of a council that does not follow the route one might expect in decentralising staff prove that the flexible approach that the Bill presents to local authorities is good news for local taxpayers? It can be applied in the best possible way for a particular area. The Government are not insisting on any particular route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The clause places a duty on local authorities to have decentralisation schemes and to consult on them. The question that which has been before us since 9.45 am is not the schemes themselves but whether the consultation and involvement provisions should be in the Bill. That is more than a technical question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was helpful. I am interested in what the Minister is saying and I would like to believe in the proposal of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. We are all in the business of tryng to make savings. The document from which the Minister properly quoted is a submission to justify something other than merely a freestanding decentralised system. If a council devised a scheme that simply involved installing a series of telephone boxes at appropriate places, would that pass muster with the Scottish Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An authority would have to consult community councils—that is a statutory obligation. I will deal with the amount of consultation that would be needed in addition in a moment with statutory consultation. The council would have to submit the scheme to the Secretary of State and take his comments into account. Ultimately, the authority has responsibility for producing the scheme after consultation. One would expect community councils to support sensible schemes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside said, schemes will vary. Opposition Members gave examples of different schemes from different parts of the country. There is no uniform pattern for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside suggested that proper schemes would not entail additional expenditure and would save money. Coopers and Lybrand undertook a study in the Lothian and Borders area, to examine the cost of a network of "local service points". It estimated that such a network would cost £2 million. Proper decentralisation schemes entail significant extra cost. The Government place a duty on local authorities to establish schemes, so will they fund the additional cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside clearly made the point that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
decentralisation schemes do not necessarily require extra resources. The hon. Member for Dundee, East correctly claims that some schemes may do so, but that is not directly relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the point of subsection (2)(a) to (2)(d)? The paragraphs prescribe the contents of a decentralisation scheme. If paragraphs (a) to (d) were omitted, the Bill would establish a duty to produce a scheme, but paragraphs (a) to (d) set out the associated duties. If those paragraphs do not constitute a prescription, what is their aim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsection sets out the possible components of decentralisation schemes. It is not exhaustive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1973, the Patterson report, which enjoyed broad consensus and reflected much expertise and experience, produced a basic model on which all Scottish local authorities base their managemant systems. Why is no equivalent to the Patterson report produced for decentralisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The skills and expertise that are available to local government in that way would be preferable to the Government's rudimentary ideas. Why is there no modern, decentralist equivalent to Patterson?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tackle guidance later. Surely the hon. Gentleman does not suggest that the Bill should incorporate an equivalent of the Patterson report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Minister knows that report was produced at the same time as the 1973 legislation. It was well considered and it worked. The Bill includes prescriptive provisions that do not help local authorities. If the Bill had not been such a rushed job, a report that enjoyed broad consensus could have been produced, to provide guidelines for proper decentralisation. That would have been preferable to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not relate his comments to subsection (9), to which the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred. An amendment has been tabled to delete that subsection. However, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley suggested that was a probing amendment..
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the point made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, but I am anxious to respond to the specific question about libraries from the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I give the hon. Gentleman the absolute assurance for which he asked. I agree, on the desirability of using libraries for the dissemination of information about decentralisation. The hon. Gentleman asked for a specific assurance that the Secretary of State's guidance to local authorities under subsection (9) will make that clear, and I give him that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I also say that there may well be scope, under the decentralisation scheme, to use libraries as an important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that libraries are as good an example of decentralisation as one can find? Should not his point about the use of library buildings be taken up by every authority in the ocntry? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that Opposition Members do not want to listen to a serious point about the use of libraries. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) is right, and the hon. Member for Linlithgow is right to ask about the use of libraries. They are an important resource in the implementation of decentralisation schemes. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley wish to intervene, or is he chatting to himself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I picked up in the intervention from the hon. Member for Ayr an implication that libraries could be used as a decentralised siting for other local government services. Is the Minister aware how much it cost to provide security in a building used for the collection of rents or local taxes? Does he know how much cost the conversion of a building would add if that building was not designed for such collection purposes, given the correct security agreements covering the staff who do the collecting? That cost would have to be borne by every decentralised organisation collecting money in a building not designed for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are debating community representation. I hope that we can return to that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, as regards the involvement of people in the devolution of action and resources, libraries are obvious places for matters to be dealt with by local bodies and groups, because so many people come and go there? In fact, I commend the Perth and Kinross district council for its effective use of its libraries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who puts the matter very well. I thought that the point about libraries had been agreed by all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we not in danger of confusing two separate issues? In libraries, there is clearly a decentralisation of provision. The amendments have more to say about devolving to representatives of community groups powers of control over those facilities. It is not a question of whether a library is in a physically separate location from the centre of the authority, but of whether decentralisation will mean that the community will have a say in how the library is run—whether it can determine the library's opening hours, and whether it is market tested, should carry a different book stock from other libraries or stock CDs and tapes. That is a different point from the one raised by the hon. Member for Ayr to which the Minister responded. I am not clear whether the Minister intends to accept the amendments, which would go a considerable way towards making decentralisation in decision making a reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under a decentralisation scheme an area committee could take such decisions in relation to a local library. It would not be for me or the Secretary of State to dictate to local authorities. I am trying to get that point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
across to Opposition Members. The local authority, after consultation, should decide whether a course of action was sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the Minister's assertion that he does not want to dictate to local authorities what the exact nature of a decentralisation scheme should be. But he has already told the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) that subsections (2)(a) to (d) show the type of decentralisation scheme that he thinks local authorities should implement. Why does he object to the addition of two other examples of decentralisation schemes that local authorities could implement, including a scheme involving community representatives? Why does he object to providing committees with officers and proper back-up to ensure that they can offer the advice of local communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman asked me that, because I was just about to deal with that key point. It was exemplified in the speech of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, to which I listened carefully. He correctly listed a range of possible candidates—community groups, football teams, Age Concern, sports organisations and others. I am not criticising that list. It shows the spread of interest of people who could be involved, but it also highlights the key problem with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does, because it shows the difficulty of defining a community group in statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that in my constituency there are at least 150 groups, whose interests range from music to sport to the Church and to goodness knows what? If the amendments were accepted, committees would comprise 200 to 300 people, all entitled to participate. Where would we draw the line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right: he puts the point with total clarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>Rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could go on for a minute. I am not refusing to give way to the hon. Gentleman: I will in a
moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley perfectly reasonably reeled off a list of organisations that he thought should be involved. There is a clear problem of statutory definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am going to throw the Minister a lifeline, because it seemed as though he was about to follow the logic of the hon. Memberfor Ayr. Until that point, we had all agreed that that is a dangerous route for any member of the Committee to go down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment clearly refers to "representatives of community groups". It does not refer to all community groups, or every community group, or specified
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
community groups. It proposes the involvement of representatives. The Minister should find that attractive. Local communities with a genuine interest in local services could have meetings with forums of people from these groups, and some representatives could be on an area committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Minister is following the logic of the hon. Member for Ayr by saying that all such groups should be represented. It really is not very sensible to try to get something that says the community groups are irrelevant, because I am afraid that when people hear of the deliberations of this Committee the Minister will be found to be on the side of those who wish to lock out community groups, and to say warm words about them but give them no involvement in local government services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not understood this point at the end of a debate which was certainly not the shortest on record. It is very simple. If one is to define community groups in statute, a definition will be needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must declare an interest, in that the scouts and the air cadets look to me to attend to their requirements in legislation—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am very proud of the fact that I represent the scouts on an international body and I see no reason to be ashamed of making these declarations. I therefore feel that if inclusion of voluntary groups in contemplated, bodies such as the air cadets and the scouts would certainly feel that they had all the responsibility and credibility required to allow them to be represented. I can imagine problems arising when other bodies, less well represented in Parliament, do not find their views expressed in Committee and included in the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He is widely admired and respected for his work for voluntary organisations. The point that I am trying to get across to hon. Members is essentially very simple and I shall make it again in the hope of being understood. The definition "community group" in statutory terms present a real difficulty. Statute demands certainly of definition. Without it the statutory requirements are meaningless. The speeches of Opposition Members in the debate have shown that certainty in the definition of the term "community group" cannot be obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way about 25 times. Perhaps I may reassure hon. Members by referring to sub section (9), and the guidance that will be issued by the Secretary of State. Guidance is quite different from statute and I can given an absolute assurance that in the guidance to local authorities from the Secretary of State points about objectives relating to the involvement of community group representatives, support and consultation with voluntary and community organisations will reflect this debate. I cannot, for the good reason of statutory definition, agree to deal with the matter in the Bill. I hope that hon. Members will accept the assurance that despite the length of the debate the ojectives of the two sides of the Committee differ very little; but that there is a proper objection to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
