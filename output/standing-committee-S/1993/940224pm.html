<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 171, in page 15, line 19, leave out "may" and insert "shall".—<i>[Mr. Daly ell]</i></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question against proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 172, in page 15, line 29, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems but a second ago that we were debating property issues in Committee, and here we are again. I was about to conclude my remarks on the subject. [HON. MEMBERS: "Shame."] Hon. Members may say that, and I notice that the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) has brought his tape recorder. I am sure that that is so that he can listen to Labour Members' speeches and commit them to memory to be used in his defence when he has to return to Scotland and face the outrage of the electorate in his constituency at the Government's proposals in the Bill.<br><br>
I was seeking the Minister's assurance that any money that accrues as a result of the sale of property will be distributed back to the successor councils and to no one else—particularly not to the Treasury. I also sought his assurance that that money would be regarded as additional funding and would not be set against the capital allocations that would otherwise have been given to the authorities to be spent on services. Finally, I asked for assurances that there would be no attempt at asset-stripping as a means of taking money back to the Treasury, or as a means of disguising the real cost of local government reform or in the hope of minimising that cost by somehow obtaining revenue from the sale of property that now belongs to councils.<br><br>
Before I finish speaking I want to draw the Minister's attention to circumstances in my area, Tayside, and to ask for his advice on how the property commission or the local authority will handle the property implications of the Bill. Several hon. Members have said that the reform will result in extra office accommodation being thrown on to property markets in Scotland. Local property markets are already severely depressed and nowhere more so than in Dundee. Is the Minister aware that 280,500 sq ft of office space is currently available in Dundee? Sites are available for a further 116,000 sq ft. The Scottish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
Office, through Scottish Enterprise Tayside, is paying taxpayers' money for the building of new offices in the centre of Dundee. As a result of the Bill, and the redundancy of hundreds of staff at Tayside regional council, available office space in Dundee is likely to double. What will be the implications of that for the taxpayer in the long run?<br><br>
The Minister must remember that the office accommodation that will become surplus—whether it is handled by a residuary body or the councils—will still have to be maintained at public expense. It will not be possible to sell it. If the Minister thinks that I am exaggerating, I refer him to the example of the Customs building in Dundee. Some time ago the Property Services Agency spent £1.5 million on refurbishing it, only to have it declared surplus by Customs and Excise. It has not been possible to rent or sell the property, which has been lying empty, for the past year to 18 months. The Bill is likely to increase the depression in the market in Dundee by throwing on to it a series of new offices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right to suggest that it is not clever to unload a lot of office property on to the market in Dundee these days. Does he know whether much office space is available to rent or acquire in Forfar or Perth to replace the accommodation that will be relinquished by Tayside regional council to fulfil functions for education, social work and so on in the replacement authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent point. I was about to move on to consider the conditions that will arise in Angus as a result of the abolition of Tayside regional council and the creation of the new Angus council. Office accommodation will have to be made available in Angus for headquarters' staff, as it will for education and social work staff and so on. My information from Tayside regional council is that the largest property on the office market in Forfar, for example—which I believe is the county town of Angus—is 925 sq ft in four small rooms on the first floor above a building society shop. Such accommodation could not be the headquarters for the new council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It could do Andrew.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) is aware of the situation.<br><br>
The largest office property available in the centre of Arbroath occupies 471 sq. ft. and is on the first floor over a cafe. I hardly think that the education or social work departments could be put in either location, so it is most likely that the new Angus council will have to provide new office space to accommodate the staff that will be relocated from Dundee. That cost will have to be borne by local council tax payers and by the taxpayer nationally in Scotland.<br><br>
The estimate for the building of the new office accommodation that will be necessary is about £5 million. Will the Minister guarantee that he will give section 94 consent to Angus council so that it can meet the cost in full without any reduction in the capital provision for its other vital services? Without such a guarantee from the Minister, Angus council will have to continue to keep its education department, social work department and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 625</span>
headquarters staff in its Dundee offices. That cannot be a good solution.<br><br>
The practical and property implication of forcing the Bill through without the consent of the Scottish people is that it has caused absolute chaos among the successor councils that will take over from the present two-tier system. The Government gave no thought to what would happen as a result of forcing the Bill through. The council officers who must deliver the services know, and have told the Government, that chaos will ensue. The Government must think again before it is too late. I hope that the Minister will think again before he allows the reforms to create chaos everywhere in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, with its substitution of "shall" for "may", is so necessary because it follows the decision to set up a residuary body. It worries me that the Secretary of State does not take on board the argument that a residuary body is unnecessary. The problem is that the possibility exists for an asset-stripping exercise. The Minister may claim that that is not what he has in mind, but he is talking about having smaller authorities which will be badly resourced. They will have great difficulty with their tax levying powers because of their rating base or council tax base. Councils may want to have money in the bank as a fund on which they can raise an income. The possibility of selling off properties and putting the money into a fund will be very attractive.<br><br>
One question, already asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), concerns what will happen to Viewforth, the present headquarters of Central regional council, and to the previous headquarters of Stirling county council, which stands alongside, if the Minister gets his way to create a Stirling council. That council would cater only to 81,000 souls. The recent lunatic behaviour includes staff dismissals and involvement in industrial tribunals. The latest budget indicates that more staff cuts are wanted. The council may be following Kyle and Carrick in the lunatic local government Olympics, getting rid of staff and resorting to the market.<br><br>
In the main town of Stirling district the authority will have two large properties, the new Viewforth and the old extended Viewforth building. One of them is very large: one is big enough to accommodate the county council offices and the other houses Central regional headquarters. It is likely that Stirling could bid for that property, as it is in the main town. It could sell it off, thus flooding the market in Stirling, which is well provided with office accommodation, thanks to the initiative of Stirling district council from 1980 to 1992, working alongside Central regional council and with the Scottish Development Agency, the Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise.<br><br>
It was interesting that people in Stirling did not try to kill each other's ideas and that the district council and the Minister at the time, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who is now Minister of State at the Department of Employment, tried to get things going and both claimed that they initiated those marvellous projects. The reality is that Stirling now has a large supply of office accommodation. Add to that both Viewforth buildings and there is a glut of property on the market. The council may want to sell that and claim it for itself.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
The other scenario is that the residuary body may claim the property for itself and say that it is surplus to requirements. If Stirling unitary authority is established—heaven forbid that the Minister goes down that crazy road—it could be said that the property is not needed there. Falkirk and Clackmannan districts would have no claim because it is not in their areas. Therefore, the residuary body would have a huge building to flog off and then, so it is said, it could pay its expenses. There is potential for asset-stripping on a large scale. There is also potential for large-scale chaos.<br><br>
Let me give a small example because we must all provide empirical evidence to support what we say. One local authority may have a smarter property section than another. That may depend on what salaries are on offer and on whether people who have come from the private sector in the past decade with property management and other skills to assist the councils can be tempted to stay. That happened in the Upper Craigs in Stirling. The then borough council, in negotiation with the county council, demolished a row of houses to widen the Craigs as the main access to Stirling town. When Central regional council fell heir to that land—because it was supposed to have been for road use without housing—it held it quietly in its portfolio.<br><br>
Stirling district council said that it wanted to build again on that land, in co-operation with a self-build organisation—which was supposed to offer cheap housing for people under the staircasing principle of buying some and renting some. Central region popped up and said, "Oh yes, that's a valuable strip of land. We knew that it was with the housing authority before 1973 but we claimed it in 1974 and so it's now road land—it's regional land. We'll sell it back to you." It named a massively inflated price of about £60,000 to £70,000.<br><br>
If local authorities are left to themselves, they will not tend to think in terms of, "Let's all be sensible about this." We have had evidence in the past couple of weeks that there is not much sense about who will control which council in which area. The Minister has used as examples this and that council to argue in whichever way he wishes. That is perhaps a great criticism of how some councils have responded, regardless of their political colour.<br><br>
It is the same with property. Councils will think about the best possible property portfolio, about what they can keep from going to the residuary body and about what they can have in the bank for later. Therefore, we need a property commission. That small example in Stirling has probably been repeated throughout the regions and districts of Scotland since 1975. The property commission may be more active in stopping such things happening at the outset.<br><br>
The potential for a residuary body creates difficulty in deciding which property is operational. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow had in mind such examples. Larbert business park, for example, was built recently in Falkirk by Central regional council, in co-operation with Scottish Enterprise. Would that be operational? Would it become the property of the residual body to be sold, or would Falkirk claim it? As it was built by the region, is it also relevant to the people of Clackmannan and Stirling? It was not built at Larbert, which is almost at the crossroads of those districts. It was built for the benefit of not just the people of Falkirk district, but all people in Central region. Unless the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 627</span>
Minister comes up with one unitary authority—logic for economic development goes for one unitary authority for the region—those properties, built at massive cost with money from Scottish Enterprise, the Government and the regional council, belong to only Falkirk.<br><br>
Callendar Park, where the college of that name once stood—set up by the Scottish Office in the days when we trained sufficient teachers for Scotland—is the home of the notorious child Child Support Agency, and therefore perhaps is not regarded quite so highly.<br><br>
Is the scheme for setting up prime office sites in Callendar Park, formerly a site that housed a college of education, merely to become the property of Falkirk district? It was created not for that purpose but as a central property to be used by people from all parts, not only from Falkirk. The Government certainly thought that it was attractive because they placed the Child Support Agency there. I doubt whether many Falkirk people work in the agency.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Questions will be asked about the ownership of the property and the land, about whether it is the operational property of Falkirk or whether it belongs elsewhere. The commission needs to look at that.<br><br>
I worry about residuary bodies. The residuary body could decide that it wanted Scottish Enterprise to be responsible for economic development, and that it, the body, would take those properties and land and sell them for some other purpose. I am sorry to have to tell the Minister that I doubt whether he knows what script he or someone in his Department will read in 1996. My hope is that he will be reading an Opposition script, otherwise it will mean that the Tories are still in office. The Government have not thought this through. There may be an intention to asset-strip local authorities and dump the extra capital on to Scottish Enterprise.<br><br>
The Viewforth building is a key example of a Minister not having thought through Central Region's and other regions' property questions. Because of Stirling's history as a county town in the centre of the region, no major centre of administrative service of the regional or county councils was ever allotted to any other part of the region. There are no major buildings belonging to the regional council running any service, nor centres for headquarters for any service in either Falkirk or Clackmannan. There are district or divisional headquarters, not headquarters that would sustain a devolved service. Everything has been in Stirling and the massive bill for Viewforth and new Viewforth continued from that time.<br><br>
All that was destroyed by the Government's policy on boundaries, which has left a massive question mark. What is to be done with that sort of building? By the Government's analysis, between 500 and 700 jobs will transfer from Stirling to Falkirk, while the regional council's calculation is 900 jobs.<br><br>
There are no buildings of adequate size in Falkirk to cope with that number of people. I live in Falkirk district. The district council has said that it can cope, but it is just not true. The same applies in Clackmannan. I pay tribute to both councils for the way in which they have undertaken their own services and provided for their own needs as district councils. There is no suitable service
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 628</span>
centre in Alloa or in Clackmannan. There is Greenfield house, which has recently been developed, but other properties have been given to private business to run. There are no other properties that can be used.<br><br>
The question that arises is where will the money come from? Clackmannan council says that it will sell Viewforth because it wants sufficient money to build adequate headquarters and extensions to Greenfield house in Alloa. Falkirk council says that it wants to build an extension, or other buildings, in Falkirk. How will they do that? I do not think that leaving it to local authorities is good enough. There must be a property commission, with clear instructions and clear rules that would ensure that any authority that is burdened by the Government's crazy policy on boundaries will have offices capable of housing staff. If the Minister wishes, I can take him to Falkirk district any time and show what offices there are. There are no configurations large enough to meet the needs of Falkirk district.<br><br>
I refer the Minister again to the Pieda report and its recommendations on commercial properties. I am aware that he knows it backwards and he probably does not need his aides' briefing. The report shows that Stirling has 105 units, of which 12 have more than 4,000 sq ft and 16 between 2,000 and 4,000 sq ft. The total available square footage is 188,831. If we add to that the size of Viewforth—the market for which was judged so carefully by Central Region's property development unit in conjunction with Scottish Enterprise, a partnership that the Minister should applaud—that profile and that demand which was based on the main administrative centre of the region being in Stirling, is suddenly blown out of the water. If Viewforth were put on the market, there would be a glut of accommodation. There would be massive over-provision resulting in massive damage to investment. Nothing has been said about that but no doubt we shall hear.<br><br>
The cost of borrowing to build those properties was arrived at by an actuarial calculation that money would come from letting them and would provide a matching income stream to pay off the debt. It is impossible to get the same rentals by adding a property of the size of Viewforth to the market. The bottom will fall out, and the income stream will cease.<br><br>
Who will pick up the debt? Who will carry the debt for Larbert Business Park, the Callendar Park expansion or the new offices that have been built in Stirling? That must be decided by a commission, which must have clear rules and regulations relating to why property is being sold, and who the beneficiary of the sale will be. When the Commission is set in motion, Falkirk council, for example, will not have to try to cope by cramming everyone into the property that it has because it cannot afford to build decent properties.<br><br>
The same applies in Stirling. I worked in close partnership with the business community there for a decade. It feels betrayed by what the Government are doing by letting Viewforth, a massive building, be dumped on the property market, thereby probably destroying private portfolios as well as the plans and dreams of the councils that invested in the infrastructure necessary for economic development.<br><br>
The Minister must accept that we need the word "shall" rather than the word "may". I hope that he will consider the fact that the residuary authority, with all its powers,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 629</span>
frightens and worries people, who feel that they are leaping into the unknown. The residuary body may not be the productive and positive thing that the Minister sells it as. It can be malicious to, and destructive of, local government and its future income streams.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a rather unusual speech from the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), who unequivocally denounced Labour-led Falkirk district council for not knowing what it was talking about in relation to the Falkirk property market. I have to say that I found the all-party representations made to us by Falkirk district council perfectly—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that very interesting. I am sure that the Minister will admit to the Committee that he did not meet anyone from Falkirk district council. I have a letter from the council's chief executive, who wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should like to thank you for your assistance to date in relation to the case for Falkirk becoming a unitary authority."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to ask whether it might be possible to meet the Minister, with me. The council sent a submission, which the Minister now tells me he recalls, in which it stated that it thinks that it can cope with offices. However, the council's officers may not have read the clauses. I hope that the Minister will withdraw his exaggerated statement of my position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to that, I will quote from a letter from the leader of the Conservative group on Falkirk district council, which refers to the hon. Gentleman:
<br><blockquote><p>I also read with alarm the fact that this MP apparently led the delegation to you in support of the Central solution—but that you were not in a position to meet with a delegation from this Council since it was not supported by the selfsame MP."</p></blockquote>
I have made the position clear many times to Scottish Members in all parts of the Committee: I would meet any responsible delegation that was led by a Member of Parliament. Neither Member of Parliament for Falkirk district sought any such meeting in connection with Falkirk district. They both asked for a meeting about Central regional council's case, and that meeting was granted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister implying that Roy Thompson, one of the two Conservative councillors on Falkirk district council, said that the council at any time requested such a meeting? I assure the Minister that no meeting with the Government was requested by Falkirk district council. No meeting, therefore, was organised or asked for by ourselves. Will the Minister accept that he said that he accepts that hon. Members who facilitate such delegations do not necessarily always agree with the arguments put by those whom they bring? That is on the record. Does the Minister accept that no meeting was requested by Falkirk district council during the consultation period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few minutes ago, the hon. Gentleman was criticising me for not meeting it. Now he says that a meeting was never requested. He cannot have it both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tell us about the property commission.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 630</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am responding to the points made by the hon. member for Falkirk, East. I am sorry if my full and well-considered response is irritating the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster). If he would stop shouting and whining from a sedentary position, we might be able to make reasonable progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The pressure is getting to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister dealt with Scottish Questions yesterday: we were impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is impressed.<br><br>
I shall deal with the questions asked by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He specifically wanted to know whether receipts resulting from sales by a residuary body would revert in full to the successor councils. As I said in an answer to the hon. Member for Angus, East, that is the case. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman might have been out of the Committee Room when I gave that answer.<br><br>
There is no provision for receipts to revert to anyone except the successor councils. I am talking about the residuary bodies, not the property commission. The commission has no power to own assets. The fears expressed by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East about asset stripping are unfounded. I do not ask hon. Members to accept that in good faith alone; there is no provision in the Bill for assets to revert to anyone other than the authorities concerned. I hope that hon. Members are reassured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure us that there will be no question of the property values reverting to any one council or disproportionately to any one council? Can he also assure us that there will be rules to ensure that those who need the value of a property to re-establish new and capable offices will be allowed to have the money, which should not go to another authority that might end up with an excessive percentage of the value of property that is sold?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a fair point in favour of a property commission. By implication, he is inquiring about what will happen if two successor councils disagree. A property commission, if set up, would have the power to arbitrate. That would be its role. It would have the power not to hold property but to arbitrate on the distribution of that property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a serious point about what the Minister said. Local authorities as they exist at the moment sometimes build a resource in one part of the authority that serves the whole of the authority. If that resource happens to be left in a small area of a new authority, the tax base will be considerably reduced.<br><br>
For example, Brownside Farm, between Paisley and Barrhead, will go into East Renfrewshire. A considerable amount of capital expenditure has been committed there. The capital debt will, I assume, transfer to East Renfrewshire, which is a smaller tax base.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 631</span>
Similarly, the Lagoon leisure centre in Paisley will transfer to a significantly smaller tax base in the new Renfrew council, although people in East Renfrewshire will still have the benefit of it because they can travel to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem does not arise in principle in relation to the Paisley Lagoon because people from outside Renfrew district use the centre. That will continue.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's valid question is that the size of the successor authority's tax base will be taken into account in the recalculation of revenue support grant from central Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister therefore committed to a radical rethink of how that formula is calculated to ensure that it takes into account the tax base of the new authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not commit myself to such rash assurances as a radical rethink. I am saying that the present and future revenue support grant system of allocations will reflect the tax base of individual authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tain Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the receipts be used by the new unitary authorities to augment their section 94 consent to capital spending quotas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
Hon. Members referred to several situations that could arise and made a good case for residuary bodies and/or a property commission in different areas. We hope that in most areas of Scotland it will be possible for existing and successor bodies to agree on these matters. There is considerable expertise on property matters in Scottish local government to which the hon. Member for Falkirk, East was right to refer. That is common ground in the Committee. I am not sure that his Labour colleagues in Clackmannan will be so enthusiastic when they read that he thought that their case was crazy. I will not tempt the hon. Gentleman to his feet; he was right to refer to expertise on property matters in Scotland.<br><br>
The general institutional demand is high and it is unlikely to reduce in the next few years. Many local authority offices are in or near commercial centres of towns and are generally of good construction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister seriously telling the Committee that he is in favour of forcing office accommodation in the centre of Dundee on to the property market? That will make it harder for Scottish Enterprise Tayside to market the offices that it is building in the centre of Dundee. One arm of Government is doing something that will harm the other arm. There is no plan or rationale. The Minister has not thought it out. He will further depress property markets in Scotland, which Scottish Enterprise Tayside is trying to do something about. The Minister is making that and other enterprise companies' jobs much harder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The institutional demand for property investment is reasonably high. Scottish Enterprise is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 632</span>
and should not provide accommodation where there is likely to be a glut. Why should taxpayers' money be spent on that? There are areas within a general market where the market may not always provide certain types of accommodation. We have specifically told Scottish Enterprise that it has a role in the strategic site and factory area where Scotland needs such sites to be instantly available for inward investment, the timing of which is difficult to forecast.<br><br>
Local authorities will have the opportunity to determine the optimum use of their accommodation over a fairly reasonable period of time. They could obviously decide on the marketability of surplus space and put it on the market when it is sensible to do so. We are talking about the redistribution of office work, not about the relocation of road maintenance depots because they will continue to serve the community from their existing locations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Scottish Office assessed what types of property are currently in demand? It is meaningless to talk generically about property. The Scottish Office should know what kind of property is in demand at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We follow property trends. The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs raised that matter in relation to new towns. The Committee will publish its evidence and the hon. Gentleman can examine its research on the relative strength of the Scottish property market.<br><br>
Scottish Enterprise does not supply accommodation; it ensures that the industrial and commercial property market works. In limited circumstances, in respect of inward investment for example, Scottish Enterprise may provide accommodation.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen's arguments emphasise the need for a flexible framework. We do not dispute that there may be practical problems in certain areas, but that does not mean that a property commission is necessary. We are moving from a two-tier to a single-tier system; the last reorganisation changed a multi-layered system to a two-tier system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It simply is not the case that in many areas there is suitable office accommodation in or near the centre of the proposed new authorities. In some areas the proposal may fit like a glove, but in others it does not and there will be practical difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not fundamentally disagree with the hon. Gentleman that there may be practical difficulties in certain areas. That is why we propose a flexible, statutory framework. Residuary bodies may be set up if requested by local authorities or there may be a property commission to give advice and to act as arbiter in disputes. That is a sensible, practical and flexible framework for common sense resolutions of property problems facing local authorities, with the assistance, if necessary of the property commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another practical problem is that the new towns are to be wound up in December 1996. For example, Livingston has leasing arrangements; it does not own property. There will thus be problems regarding rating receipts.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 633</span>
I want the Minister to clarify two matters beyond peradventure. I assume that he will confirm that the net disposal proceeds realised by residuary bodies will be distributed in total to the successor authorities and not to the Treasury.<br><br>
Secondly, I assume that he will confirm that the residuary bodies will be used only to resolve residual problems, not to carry out an asset-stripping exercise designed to help out the Treasury or to disguise the true cost of local government reorganisation. I hope that he will confirm those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurances that he wants. He referred to "net disposal receipts". That is correct, because the receipts will be net of the costs of disposal. As I understood him, he was correct to say that the receipts net of costs would pass to the successor authorities.<br><br>
I was trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's second point exactly. I am anxious not to mislead him. I have the general drift, but perhaps he could say again what assurances he wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asking the Minister to confirm that the residuary bodies will be used only to resolve residual problems, and not to carry out a cynical asset-stripping exercise designed to help out the Treasury or to disguise the true cost of local government reorganisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely correct on two grounds. First, the residuary bodies will not be in a position to give any assets back to the Treasury even if, by any mischance, they wished to do so. They have no powers to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Bill give the Secretary of State the opportunity to give residuary bodies such powers through orders and regulations, as it refers to "such other functions"? He may also give them directions. Surely the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to give the residuary bodies those powers, if he cares to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not. That is made quite clear in the relevant subsection, which I quoted earlier in the debate. There is no such power.<br><br>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Linlithgow that the residuary bodies will undertake functions only at the request of local authorities. That is the mechanism by which they will be established and will undertake their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having regard to the Minister's answers on the arbitration role of the property commission, there seems to be no justification at all for having a residuary body. Should not all reference to residuary bodies be deleted from the Bill? I should have thought that that suggestion fits in with the tone of the Minister's answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, it does not. The residuary bodies would have powers to hold and dispose of properties, whereas a property commission would not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The curtain has come down. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 634</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 153, in page 15, line 26, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that such other functions referred to shall not include the power to sell or otherwise dispose of any property presently held by an existing local authority, or properly transferred to a new authority under the provisions of section 15)".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has said that the reserve powers will probably not be used, that they are there to help everybody and that they will be minimal. However, opposition Members are still unclear about those powers in terms of what the Bill provides for and what will be introduced through orders. Eventually, this will end up on the Secretary of State's desk, and he has the power to fill in the details through orders and regulations.<br><br>
The amendment is an attempt to clarify what powers are available to the property commission and the residuary bodies under the Bill. Property is not the most exciting subject for the general public, but it is one of the most important. Like staff and budgeting issues, it does not immediately find the front pages of the tabloids, but those subjects are at the heart of the workings of local authorities and determine whether they are a success or a failure. They also determine the scope of what they are capable of doing. That is why I tabled the amendment.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
Collectively, Scottish councils are the largest holders of property in the country. Therefore, the issue is immensely important to every sector in the land. Through a vast array of halls, schools, homes, community centres and so on, the property that they own represents the sum total of past investments by generations of local taxpayers. The way in which the property is treated is of major importance to local communities and to local economies. The property is a public asset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Member has also tabled amendment No. 154. It might be helpful to him if we debated the amendments together. Therefore, and with the agreement of the Committee, with amendment No. 153 we shall take amendment No. 154, in page 15, line 28, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) The principal object of the Commission shall be to ensure the proper distribution and use of property for the support of the social and community policies of the new authorities".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That might be helpful. Would it help if I moved the amendments separately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member can move them one at a time, but we can debate both.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was that the property is made up of publicly bought assets. The amendments state that it should stay in and belong to the community.<br><br>
Powers given to the property commission should not include powers to sell or otherwise dispose of property held by existing local authorities or of property transferred to a new authority under the provisions of section 15.<br><br>
Amendment No. 154 specifically mentions
<br><blockquote><p>"the social and community policies of the new authorities".</p></blockquote>
The commission should ensure the proper distribution and use of property to support such policies. If publicly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 635</span>
owned properties are to be disposed of, their future should be decided by the local communities that own them and by elected representatives, who are accountable. Property is an issue for the community and should not be decided behind closed doors by yet another Government-appointed non-elected quango or by a Minister using the massive powers of secondary legislation.<br><br>
Clause 19 gives the Secretary of State powers to set up the property commission. The amendments seek to clarify its conduct and its personnel and power. Amendment No. 153 states that the property commission will not have the power to sell or dispose of property held by an existing local authority or transferred to a new authority. The future of the property should be decided by elected councillors and by the local communities that own it, and not by an unaccountable outside body.<br><br>
Once they have been set up, there will be no control over the property commission or a residuary body, but, of course, that will depend on who is appointed to them. The Minister has not said who or what organisations will be represented. If he has, I have not heard him say it in Committee.<br><br>
There should be no sale of the century of public assets and no sell off without any locally accountable consent. The Secretary of State's property commission should be advisory only and not used by the Government as a means to sell off yet more public assets. The commission will be a creature of the Secretary of State. It will be subject to his direction, and its functions will be controlled by him. Limitations on the Secretary of State's powers are not written into the Bill. That is what the amendments would provide. They would clarify the matter and add specific limitations to the Bill.<br><br>
There is a massive pool of expertise and experience in all aspects of property management, control and maintenance in the property and architects departments of local authorities throughout Scotland. They are worried about how the Government's proposals will affect the future of those skilled and experienced in-house teams. The property needs of local authorities and the vast range of property with which they deal have been built up over the years. In-house, professional teams facilitate and manage those services on behalf of local communities. I have seen the invaluable work on all aspects of public property control that the trained, professional staff carry out. How will that publicly controlled expertise fare under the proposals? The Bill provides for property transfer, but includes no safeguard for skilled support services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that the Minister announced last week that 65 per cent, by value of all property work will be subject to compulsory competitive tendering from October 1997. Property will go into limbo and property services will be thrown into further disarray.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The Government wish to scatter the in-house teams so that they disappear. That would be a major mistake, from which our communities would suffer.<br><br>
The Bill does not place a duty on the new authorities to make public provision for future public management of publicly owned property. I wish to ensure that the outcome is not a massive sell-off of public assets or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 636</span>
deterioration in the quality of public buildings. The Government take us light years away from the Victorian principle of civic pride, which led to the creation of many public buildings. It engendered the wish for expert, experienced teams to create community assets. In Scotland, a community spirit and a strong sense of identity exist. The Government ignore that at their peril and at the risk of losing an important aspect of Scottish life. I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee how property transfer will affect the future of in-house teams.<br><br>
The commission should be used only to resolve disputes, as it was in 1975. It should not pursue sales or disposal policy. The Bill as drafted might grant the commission rights to all local authority property. I hope that the Minister will assure us that that is not the case. If the commission's function was only to transfer to local authorities the property that would enable them to carry out their functions, public property might be sold and the proceeds given to the Government. I wish to ascertain that that will not happen. I want that assurance to be on the record. The property commission's tasks should be advice and arbitration—nothing more.<br><br>
The Bill states little about property beyond granting powers to transfer property from the outgoing authorities to the new councils, and to appoint a property commission with a duty to advise about the property to be transferred. I hope that the Minister will comment on the continuity of in-house design teams and their client groups. In-house teams have fostered good work practices, high standards and continuity in property dealing at a local level. The Minister wishes to promote the private sector. Private consultants have drawn heavily on the expertise, knowledge and skills of the client local authorities' own professional teams. I hope that the Minister will respond to anxieties about the future of the departments. Will in-house teams be broken up, as the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) suggested? Will the build-up of good, accountable practice in building procurement and maintenance management be lost? Such a loss would be detrimental to the efficient conduct of business and would increase costs.<br><br>
Will the Minister ensure that members of the property commission do not lack the necessary experience, knowledge and expertise in local government property? The commission must be able to advise property. What sort of people will be appointed to the property commission? What will be their background? Will the personnel of professional or local government associations be members of the property commission?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Albert McQuarrie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope not.<br><br>
Amendment No. 154 refers to social and community policies. I seek absolute assurances and guarantees that the properties that were created for the public good will continue to be used for that purpose and will not, as the hon. Member for Linlithgow said, be the subject of public asset stripping. Local authorities should continue to provide services on merit and in accordance with their past record. The amendments would secure those objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are debating amendment No. 154 as well as amendment No. 153.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 637</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on amendment No. 153. Indeed, I gave assurances a few moments ago, when perhaps he was scribing his words of wisdom. I can confirm that a property commission has no power to own property. Subsection (1)(c), about which he is concerned, refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"carrying out such other functions in relation to the transfer of property".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The commission cannot own property, but it can sell property under the direction of the Secretary of State. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If the commission cannot own property, it cannot sell it. It cannot sell something that it does not own. [HON. MEMBERS: "Remember TSB."] Under the provisions of the Bill, the commission cannot sell property. I confirm that a property commission cannot hold or sell property; it can advise and arbitrate.<br><br>
I thought that the hon. Gentleman made an outstanding speech against amendment No. 154. It is a highly interventionist amendment. It would give a commission appointed by the Secretary of State the right to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Linlithgow knows better than to consult members of the public during the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pointing out that however well intentioned the amendment may be, the hon. Member for Angus, East made an excellent speech against it. The amendment would give the commission appointed by the Secretary of State a power
<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure the proper distribution and use of property for the support of the social and community policies of the new authorities."</p></blockquote>
So this unelected body would have the power to dictate to local authorities how they should use their property. That is not right. Local authorities should have complete flexibility and the power to decide how they want to use the new property.<br><br>
I gather that that was the burden not of the amendment but of the hon. Gentleman's speech. Given the assurance that I have repeated to him that the property commission will not have powers to hold or sell, I hope that he will feel reassured and will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am curious, because the property commission may not have that power—the Secretary of State can direct it in many ways—but residual bodies could act. I am concerned about what will appear in orders and in secondary legislation. The amendments would put specific powers in the Bill to ensure a limitation on such an exercise of power by central Government. I still want those powers included in the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 155, in page 15, line 30, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Provided that such constitution and membership shall comply with the following:
<ol>
<li>That the Commission be appointed and operational no later than the date appointed for the first elections to the new authorities.</li>
<li>That the Commission shall not exist for a period of more than two years.</li>
<li>That the membership shall not exceed eight persons.</li>
<li>That the membership of the Commission shall comprise a majority of persons with appropriate professional and operational experience of the procurement and administration of property in local government".</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the thinking behind the amendments, which deal with the membership of the property commission. It is vital to have the right people with relevant experience to fulfil the important task that will be entrusted to the commission if it is set up. We should not be presciptive at this stage; it is far more important to ensure that the provisions in the Bill allow for maximum flexibility to meet the concerns of the old and new councils in future. But I can give a categorical assurance to the Committee that local government interests will be consulted before a property commission is set up. Indeed, the clause as drafted provides that the Secretary of State must do so.<br><br>
Amendment No. 155 seeks to limit the life of the commission to two years. That is not advisable, because at this distance we cannot accurately gauge what problems may arise with property. That was one of the points made by Opposition Members. We do not want to force councils to make hasty decisions about the rationalisation of their accommodation. Perhaps on reflection Opposition Members will realise that it is not sensible to place an arbitrary time limit on the commission's life. For the

information of hon. Members, the property commission set up in the previous reorganisation was wound up after four years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that agreement of property transfers could be handled by local members and staff who already have detailed local knowledge. I understood that the Minister agreed with that, in general terms, so I shall not press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 175, in page 15, leave out lines 42 to 47.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment refers to the funding of the property commission. I have mentioned that issue in previous debates. It is not the Government's intention that the property commission per se should be a body funded in the same way as any residuary body—by local government. The functions of the property commission are very different from the executive functions of the residuary body, which would parallel those of local authorities. They are much more closely akin to the role of the staff commission.<br><br>
I am prepared to consider the amendments, but I am not prepared to accept them immediately, for reasons that I can give the hon. Member for Linlithgow if he would like. I appreciate the aims of the amendments. I hope that I can reassure the Committee on the general thrust of the Government's thinking. I shall consider the amendments before Report and then be in touch with members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that that offer was made in good faith. It is highly desirable that members of the property commission should have relevant knowledge and experience of the matters that they are dealing with to enable them to carry out their roles effectively. Such experience should relate both to local government and property issues. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on property issues and the property commission. It is clear to most members of the Committee that the debate has highlighted the sheer stupidity of the reorganisation. The Government are supposedly out of the market, yet are now willing to distort the property market in a way that few people have experienced, certainly in recent decades.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow pointed out that we also have a new town wind-up. Huge assets and many properties will be thrown into the chaos that the Bill will create. Indeed, it appears that the Government have arranged for much of the transfer of local government properties and the winding-up of the new towns to coincide, to create maximum confusion in the property market. That is wholly ridiculous from the point of view of the experts who work in local government and who are worried about the value of the fabric in their areas; and from that of estate agents and others in a property market that is still depressed after Scotland's longest depression since the 1930s.<br><br>
People outside the Palace must be wondering what the Government will do next in relation to the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow has exposed in detail the paradoxes, inconsistencies and anomalies of this crazy measure.<br><br>
We are dealing with vital community assets—not with empty buildings that he unused around local authority areas. We are discussing headquarters buildings— valuable properties. Yes, they have a market value, but they are also enormously important for the community. A sense of community is missing on the part of the Conservatives. We do not want the property commission to be involved in a free-for-all in which valuable property is sacrificed to a crazy reorganisation of local government.<br><br>
We are, of course, worried about the effect of the chaos on overall costs. Can we really believe that there will not be attempts to asset-strip Scottish local authorities to pay for the reorganisation? Labour Members do not believe the Government's account. There will be a temptation to allow properties that are valuable both financially and in community terms to be exploited to offset, in some respects, the costs of the exercise. We hear the Government saying that that cannot happen—that a body is being set up simply to look after the transfer of property from one set of authorities to another. However, there is a risk—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Go on, we need a laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is encouraging me to give way, so, being charitable, I shall do so briefly.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman, though I am surprised at his remarks because I thought that we were engaged in a debate.<br><br>
I have a serious question. Cannot the hon. Gentleman envisage any circumstances in which local authorities—or anyone else—would dispose of assets that they did not require, to turn the cash to other use?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are fortunate in Scotland to have efficient, effective local authorities with a sharp eye for value for money. Of course, if there is an opportunity to make use of a property for which a local authority has no use, the process that the hon. Gentleman described will take place. That happens day in, day out and in all Scottish local authorities. However, there is a difference between that and the free-for-all that the Government are deliberately constructing as part of the reorganisation.<br><br>
We believe that the commission is unnecessary. We have heard much in the debate about Central region. It is with immense sadness that we read today in <i>The Herald</i> of Glasgow that the Tories are to ditch a free speaker. Colonel Frank Saunders, who graced this House with his presence last week and who has been in local government for more than 52 years, has now been advised by the Conservative party, because of his attacks on the reorganisation, that he may not be a councillor after May. He was probably speaking up for the Central region headquarters in Stirling, to ensure that sanity would prevail. He has been repaid with a 'phone call from the men in grey suits to say that, after 52 years, his services will be dispensed with. That has more to do with pre-war Germany than with modern Scottish local government. The Minister is a charitable, sane and sensible person. Therefore, will he intervene to ensure that Colonel Saunders is allowed, after me, to carry on the fight for Central region headquarters?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I seek your guidance. I have difficulty understanding how the hon. Gentleman's remarks relate to the amendment. They probably have as much to do with the amendment as the goings on in Monklands district council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes hon. Members are a little guilty of straying from the topic under discussion and the issue of Colonel Saunders does not relate to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall always accept your fine judgments from the Chair, Mr. Martin. Suffice it to say, that I mentioned Colonel Saunders only because of his constant and excellent outpourings from Central region headquarters. Plainly, he is worried about the future of that building—and buildings form the subject of our debate.<br><br>
We shall vote against the clause, as a protest at all the nonsense that we hear about the Bill and especially about the property free-for-all, which will not benefit local authorities or the private sector and will only add to the public perception of the chaos that this measure will inflict on Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the Minister has been unable to give a more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
explicit description of how the provisions in clause 19 will work in practice. The system may be flexible and the details may be worked out in orders that will come before the House under the affirmative or negative procedures, but I am still uncertain about how it will work out in practice.<br><br>
In particular, there has been a change since 1973. Generally the courts more readily admit questions to be considered by them under the process of judicial review. That happens much more now than was so in both Scottish and English courts. I am concerned that questions relating to the property commission and to matters arising under the provisions of the clause will lead to disputes in the courts which people will raise via the route of judicial review. I am surprised that there is no mechanism for disputes that will arise almost inevitably from the role of the property commission and other consequences of clause 19. Almost certainly, some disputes will wind their way to the courts and I wonder why the Government did not anticipate that.<br><br>
This matter does not apply to clause 19; it is dealt with in clause 15. I recall clearly what happened under the old system in relation to common good funds, especially when the public had access to property that was in the ownership of such funds. If it was alienated in any way, there was a right of appeal to the sheriff and permission had to be sought from the courts in exercise of and the discharge of some functions and duties. I am worried that we have still not pinned down the use to which common good funds will be put. I realise that we have already dealt with clause 15, Mr. Martin. However, it does not provide a right of recourse to the courts in such circumstances. Certainly, in relation to common good funds, there is slightly less protection now than before.<br><br>
I return to clause 19 and ask the Government seriously to consider what recourse may be had to the courts of the land—the Outer House and Inner House of the Court of Session—for disputes that may arise from the works of the property commission when local authorities, in the future, are not happy with the decisions taken on their behalf and advice that has been given. The Government must address that serious question. It is better to do so now than be forced to pick up the pieces after an adverse court decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the tributes that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) paid to Colonel Saunders. When I was the Member for Bo'ness, which was part of Central region, he certainly had the respect of Councillor Charles Smith, the convenor of the council and my other Labour colleagues.<br><br>
First, I shall draw attention to concerns that Colin Bradford of Tayside, writing on behalf of Colin Black, the chief executive of Tayside, has raised about asset stripping. First there is the question of property which has been declared or is in practice surplus to the operational needs of the successor authorities. The loss of such land will make it harder for the successor authorities to fund their capital spending plans at a time when capital allocations are so restricted. If the residual body were able to clean out say two years' worth of surplus property, it could amount to a loss of about £6 million or £7 million worth of new capital projects to the three new Tayside councils. My hon. Friend dealt eloquently with the question of Tayside. I merely point out that it is a question that can be repeated throughout every region.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
Secondly, there is the land bank, property which is being held in reserve against the possibility of future operational need but where no capital project has yet been advanced to approval stage. The loss of such land would make it harder for successor authorities to plan or bring about capital projects and to respond quickly and flexibly to changing circumstances. It would also make schemes very expensive. That is a substantial point. I lay down the marker that some of us may like to return to it on Report.<br><br>
For reason of time I shall not go into the commercial matters in depth; I shall simply say that local authorities, particuarly the successors to the old city corporations, have been aquiring miscellaneous property by purchase or gift since the middle ages. Where that property is now developed or use for specific local authority functions such as parks or housing, the transfer arrangements should not cause any difficulties. However, and this is the rub, for those local authorities that have a portfolio of commercial, possibly city centre property, which is set out and retained for its potential for income producing and redevelopment potential or simply for the landlord control it affords, there is the risk that the residuary bodies will try to sell off as much as possible. That is most likely to affect district council property but it could include regional properties such as multi-storey car parks.<br><br>
The loss of such property would result in a reduction in rental income which over time is inflation protected, unlike reductions on loan charges, a reduction in councils' ability to influence the timing, nature, quality and extent of refurbishment or redevelopment of city centres and the use and management of significant properties, and the loss of the opportunity to take capital gains at times when commercial realities give the best prices.<br><br>
Finally, there is the general question of economic development. I owe it to those who have gone into the matter in depth to put all that on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) referred briefly to the common good funds which are provided for under clause 15, I can confirm that we have not changed any rights of recourse to the courts in relation to common good funds. On his more general point, one can never rule out the possibility of people taking bodies to the courts, but the property commission is an advisory body and an arbitrator. I would hazard the view that it is probably fairly unlikely that it would be taken to the courts.<br><br>
To respond to the general points of the hon. Member for Linlithgow, it is worth re-emphasising that any sale of assets in the various circumstances that he posited to the Committee would involve a residuary body only if the local authorities wanted to have such a body. The proceeds of a sale of assets, such as the land banks to which he referred, would revert to the successor authorities, should such a sale take place.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a point about disputes. Disputes can arise, which is an argument for having residuary bodies in an area in which there might be a dispute to avoid recourse to the courts.</span></p>

JOINT COMMITTEES AND JOINT BOARDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 201, in page 16, line 31, after "authorities", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"after having advertised the proposal and having considered any representations as to said proposals made within an eight week period of such advertisement".</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to lead the debate about the proposed amendments to the clause, which deals with the powers of the Secretary of State to establish joint boards. I say that not because of the particular interest that I take in a certain board in the east end of Glasgow, but because of the great dangers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A joint board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says a joint board. It is a disjointed board at the moment and I would be glad to see the back of it.<br><br>
I am delighted to move the amendment because the likely explosion in the number of joint boards and joint committees will present a danger to local government democracy. That must be taken into consideration by the Committee before it allows the clause to stand part of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment provides for the advertisement of the Secretary of State's intention to establish a joint board, giving the public an opportunity to make their views on the matter known before a board is set up. In my estimation, the public have strong views about the establishment of joint boards as a means of replacing services currently provided by directly elected local authorities.<br><br>
The central criticism that many people have about joint boards is that they weaken local democracy and make local government in Scotland less rather than more accountable. That is the opposite of what the Government tell us that they are trying to achieve in the Bill. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local Government plays a unique and vital part in the political, democratic and administrative life of Scotland."</p></blockquote>
He hopes that these reforms will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 645</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"provide Scotland with a source of robust and relevant local democracy."</p></blockquote>
The sentiments expressed by the Secretary of State for Scotland sit uneasily with the powers that he is given under clause 20 to establish joint boards. I suggest that Conservative Members think very carefully about the clause.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
Later in that same debate, the Secretary of State spoke about the principles that underpin local government reform in Scotland. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"it is important to reiterate exactly the three key objectives of the single-tier structure proposed in the Bill.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>First, we want local councils to be strong, and, in local government, strength comes from being accountable. The ability of the public to call their local authority to account—through the ballot box or otherwise—will be improved beyond recognition where all local government responsibilities rest with a single council in an area. More accountable local government means more powerful local government.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Secondly, we want the delivery of local services to be improved. The fact that one organisation will have responsibility for the full range of services will be a major step forward on service delivery."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thirdly, we want a less bureaucratic, more flexible and efficient structure of local government."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 17 January 1994, Vol. 235, <i>c.</i> 533–38.]</p></blockquote>
If those principles underpin the Bill, how on earth can Conservative Members justify giving the Secretary of State the powers to establish joint boards, which take from single-tier authorities in Scotland many of their present powers and responsibilities?<br><br>
If strength comes from accountability, and if accountability is strengthened by a single tier of local government responsible for all services, surely we will undermine that strength, weaken local authorities and make them less accountable by taking those services from them and transferring them to joint boards and committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled. We are talking about the power of the Secretary of State to set up a joint board, but only if the local authorities concerned request it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggests that local authorities are in charge of the process. That is not so, and if the Minister is patient and listens to my speech I will argue the point very coherently. Local authorities will have no choice but to seek to set up joint boards because of the nature of the local government reform proposed in the Bill. If the Minister does not understand that, he should. I hope that he listens carefully to the points that are being made.<br><br>
I believe that the clause undermines all the principles in the Bill that the Secretary of State claims that he is defending. I suspect the explanation for the apparent contradiction between what the right hon. Gentleman says and what is in the Bill lies in the fact that the Government's rhetoric very rarely matches what they do in the real world. This is a very good example.<br><br>
In some instances, the Bill directly removes from local authorities some of the services for which they are responsible. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) will take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 646</span>
over from his hon. Friend and reply to debates when we reach the part of the Bill that provides that water and sewerage services are taken directly away from local authorities. The function of reporter to the children's panel will also be taken directly from them.<br><br>
In other cases, such removal of responsibility will be indirect. The Government will reduce the size of local councils in Scotland so that they will no longer be capable of delivering many of the services that they currently deliver. I am thinking in particular about specialist services. The social work department of Tayside regional council runs out-of-hours services, as, I suspect, do many other social work departments of many other regional councils throughout Scotland. Such a service requires a sufficient number of specialist staff of sufficient quality for it to operate as it does.<br><br>
Tayside regional council has the population, the revenue base and the resources that allow it to pay the salaries that attract specialist staff to its social work department and thus enable it to provide very specialised service to the people in the area. The successor authorities that will replace Tayside regional council will not have the resources, population or revenue base to do that. Dundee will be just over a third of Tayside's size, while Perth and Kinross, like Angus, will be about a third of that size. They will not have the resources to provide the same quality of service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallic <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman earlier referred to his "coherent words". I agree that they are usually coherent, although not always logical. The hon. Gentleman suggested that the establishment of joint boards took away responsibility from local authorities and lost the local voice. The local authority structure in the Bill will cause the reverse to happen. The regional services offered by Strathclyde regional council in many ways have been dominated by the Glasgow voice. Massed ranks of Glasgow councillors vote against my constituents' interests. Local boards will guarantee that my constituents' voice will be heard and will ensure local accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman completely misses the point. The boards will not be local. They will have to cover wide areas to provide the services that I described. The successor authorities in my part of Scotland will not have enough resources to afford the staff needed to provide the specialist services in the social work department. That is not only my contention: the same information comes from the Tayside region's social work department. The hon. Gentleman's own regional council would tell him the same thing.<br><br>
The alternative, if the successor authorities cannot provide the services because they cannot find the resources, is that some kind of joint committee or arrangement will have to be set up to ensure that the services continue. Other services are involved, such as the Pole Park family counselling centre and the McKinnon centre for people with physical disabilities. They provide services for everyone in the current Tayside regional area. They are located in Dundee. After the reorganisation, a joint arrangement will be needed to ensure that people in Angus and in Perth and Kinross will have access to the centres.<br><br>
Other specialist services are involved. I shall go into detail about them, so that Conservative Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 647</span>
understand the consequences of the reforms that they are pushing through. At present, Tayside social work department has a service that helps with adoption, and with residential child care. It offers child protection services. It has social officers specialising in mental health and in problems related to HIV and AIDS.<br><br>
The regional social work department also funds the Tayside and Western Isles Association for the Deaf. It is involved in traumatic brain injuries, in the ability centre and in respite care services. It is involved with projects funded from the mental illness specific grant. They have responsibilities where social work services merge with health services. It is involved with the special care baby unit at Ninewells hospital and the Armistead child development centre in Dundee. It also has social work input into the Tayside alcohol problems service and into the drug problem service.<br><br>
That is not an exhaustive list, but it shows the sort of specialised service that the regional councils, with their large populations and large revenue base can provide. They are able to pay the specialist staff to provide such services. The Minister knows that the three successor authorities will not disaggregate the services of that social work department. Angus will not create it own social work department, and neither will Perth and Kinross or Dundee. Nor will there be separate directors of social work, chief executives and so on. The successor authorities will have to try to retain the Tayside social work department in one form or another. That will make inevitable the establishment of another joint committee.<br><br>
The Minister is wrong to say that joint arrangements will arise only when local authorities want them—in some cases, authorities will have no choice. The joint arrangements for all the services that I have described will be so complex that it will probably be necessary to incorporate the joint committee in some form of joint board.<br><br>
It is not only social work that is at stake. Other members of the Committee have more, and certainly more recent, experience in education. A range of specialist educational services are currently provided by regional councils. It will be too expensive for the successor authorities to provide them. Advisory services, special school provision and the educational psychology service, which is available in many areas, may all be called into question by the reform of local government.<br><br>
One issue about which I am concerned and of which I have direct experience is the provision made for children with visual or hearing impairments. I was on Tayside regional council in the mid-1980s, representing the Gilburn ward in Dundee. A family that lived in that ward had two children who had been born blind. The parents came to me and said that it was a disgrace that their children could not go to school locally. They had to go to the Royal Blind school in Edinburgh. From Monday to Friday, the children were boarding in Edinburgh. At the age of five, they were away from their family. They could come home only at weekends.<br><br>
The family argued that it was ridiculous and asked whether Tayside regional council could do anything about it. I took the case up with the director of education. Work began and, eventually, Tayside regional council was able to make provision in schools in Dundee for children with visual handicaps. Therefore, children do not have to travel to Edinburgh.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 648</span>
It would not be possible, however, to justify such a service for Dundee. There are not enough of those children in Dundee. A service can be justified only by taking kids from all over Tayside—from Montrose, Forfar, Perth and elsewhere. They come to Dundee for school, but they can return home to their parents in the evening. A successor authority will not be able to provide such a service. It can only be provided through joint arrangements with other authorities. If authorities want to maintain a service, they will have to make joint arrangements.<br><br>
It does not stop there. I could go on all day talking about the functions provided by local councils and giving examples of why they will need to set up joint committees. Tayside Contracts works for the Government and for Tayside regional council. It is a direct-service organisation that carries out repairs to the roads. It is an excellent organisation with a large budget. It wins 90 per cent, of the contracts for which it tenders. It also provides a useful role for the Government and the council by acting as a benchmark of what is a reasonable price for the contracts that are put out to tender. If there were not such a direct-service organisation against which we could compare private-sector contracts, the private sector could form a cartel to push up the price. There would be no public-sector provider against which the private sector could be judged. Will Tayside Contracts continue under a form of joint committee between the three successor authorities?<br><br>
A direct result of the reform of local government will be an explosion in the number of joint committees across Scotland as councils struggle to provide the services that are currently provided by regional councils. In the White Paper, the Government said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many people feel distant from their local authorities and do not understand their roles".</p></blockquote>
That was a direct criticism of the two-tier system of local government in Scotland. The Minister has made the same argument. It is said that the two-tier system is too confusing and that people do not understand who is responsible for what. They do not know, for example, whether Tayside regional council, Dundee district council, Strathclyde regional council and so on are responsible.<br><br>
The confusions that exist about the two-tier system will be as nothing compared with the confusions that there will be when the joint committees and joint boards are set up across Scotland. People will not know which council on a joint board will be responsible for the services in their area. If one lives in Dundee, will Dundee council be responsible? It may say, "It is not us, but the joint board". Which joint board will be responsible? Will its members from Perth and Kinross or from Dundee be responsible? That will lead to serious confusion and local democracy will become far less accountable.<br><br>
The Bill does not state that the members of the boards will necessarily be elected councillors. Even if the Minister says that they will be elected councillors, will they be the only members of the boards? Will the Secretary of State be able to appoint his nominees to the boards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may speed matters if I say to the hon. Gentleman that, under the provisions of the 1973 Act, the Secretary of State cannot make appointments to joint boards: local authorities must do that. The Bill makes the same provision.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 649</span>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is useful to have that statement on record. However, it will not speed matters. Local authorities will be delighted that the Minister has conceded that membership of the boards will be under their control and will include elected councillors. However, tensions will exist within the joint boards and committees about the provision of services. I shall use Dundee as an example because it is the only area about which I know. I cannot speak about Strathclyde.<br><br>
Let us imagine that a joint committee is to provide social work services in Dundee. Dundee has the highest proportion of one-parent households and the highest rate of child referrals in the Tayside region. More children are on the child protection register in Dundee than in other areas in Tayside. Two thirds of out-of-hours referrals originate in Dundee, not in Perth and Kinross or Angus. Dundee is a bigger consumer of social services than Angus or Perth and Kinross. If a joint committee or a joint board is to provide social services in our area, what will be the attitude of councillors from Perth and Kinross or from Angus? I suspect that they will be reluctant to ask their council taxpayers to pay for services that are mostly required in Dundee. I do not criticise them for that attitude, which is natural. They will want delivery of services to be switched fairly between the three regions. Dundee may lose out badly.<br><br>
Dundee is an urban area of high unemployment and has a great deal of poverty. It will need greater resources. Tayside regional council can recognise that need, but such recognition by a joint board or a joint committee will not be so easy. I am assuming that the three successor authorities will agree to form joint committees to provide social services and so on, but perhaps they will not agree to do that. When the Secretary of State visited Perth and Kinross councillors, there was a suspicion in Dundee that they discussed the possible twinning of Perth and Kinross with Stirling, rather than with Dundee or Angus. The political leanings in Perth and Kinross and in Stirling are similar. They may wish to leave out Dundee and Angus, but Angus, too, may decide to remain alone. Such problems will arise, and the Minister has not considered them sufficiently.<br><br>
I am not the only critic; many criticisms come from local government circles in Scotland. The convener of social work in Tayside region, Councillor Jim Mudie, issued a statement, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Director's report makes clear that the only way three unitary authorities in Tayside could maintain the same levels and quality of service is by spending substantially more money or by introducing a whole range of joint boards and joint arrangements which in themselves will be wasteful; anti-democratic; and generate huge administrative bureaucracies".</p></blockquote>
That is hardly the Government's objective. Councillor Jim Mudie is a Labour politician, but opposition is not confined to Labour politicians. Academic research supports the view set out in the report, and the view is based on events in England. The University of Birmingham has published a report entitled, "After Abolition: the Operation of the post 1986 Metropolitan Government System in England". That report pointed out that 75 per cent, of expenditure on former metropolitan services did not transfer to the successor district authorities, but went to joint boards. The report described it as,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 650</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"a transition from one form of metropolitan government (a two tier system with a directly elected upper tier) to another—a two tier system with an indirectly elected upper tier".</p></blockquote>
How does moving from a directly elected tier to an indirectly elected tier strengthen democracy in Scotland and make local democracy more accountable? It has quite the opposite effect. It undermines his claims for the single tier structure and it raises major issues about public comprehension, public accountability and resource allocation between the different parts of the same area.<br><br>
The report also points out that while there was little real change in the quality of the service that was available through these joint boards thanks to the work of the professionals who worked for the joint boards, costs increased. Joint boards deliver services more expensively than did the former metropolitan councils. There was an increase of 4 per cent, in real terms after the move from directly to indirectly elected authorities. There was evidence that the joint boards spent much more on staff than did the metropolitan councils.<br><br>
The experience in England suggests that much greater costs are involved in moving away from directly elected authorities to joint boards. It is even suggested that the costs were greater for the services that were transferred directly to the district authorities. Even the services that will be delivered through the single tier authority are now likely to be more expensive than previously. That is because the new authorities have to take on new administrative costs to provide the services that have been transferred to them. That leads to duplication and losses in economies of scale and adds to the bill.<br><br>
Reviewing the report I referred to, Professor Arthur Midwinter, professor of politics at Strathclyde university whose opinion the Committee should listen to, summed up by saying
<br><blockquote><p>"The implications of this for the Government's reform agenda in Scotland are clear enough. The evidence contradicts the key assumptions on cost, duplication and accountability. The Inlogov study shows the inadequacy of a reform agenda based on simplistic assumptions. It shows it is time to think again."</p></blockquote>
It is time for the Minister to think again. In his winding-up speech on Second Reading the Secretary of State for Scotland said that he wanted to get back to basics in local government and wanted to see local authorities that were local. He wanted to give a new impetus to the growth of strong local democracy. But the exact opposite is likely to be the outcome of the Bill. The implication of clause 20 is that services are likely to be taken away from the single tier authorities, and that will lead to less accountability, greater confusion and a far poorer type of democracy in Scotland than at present. If the Minister really was a listening Minister, as he claimed to be earlier, he should think again not just about clause 20, but about the whole Bill and chuck it in the river behind him. Let us get back to dealing with the serious problems in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. As usual, he made a powerful and eloquent case and there is not a great deal left to say. I simply want to underline a few points that he made and add one or two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike his hon. Friend, is the hon. Gentleman willing to tell the Committee how the amendment would work?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 651</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would be happy to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may recall that not long ago there was an attempt to establish a joint board for Hearts and Hibs which did not quite work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately. Mr. Wallace Mercer, who is a supporter of the Conservative party is not the most subtle person when it comes to negotiations with other clubs in the vicinity of Edinburgh.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to place a requirement on the local authority to give public notice of proposed joint arrangements. The Bill's proposals will necessitate the setting up of a number of joint arrangements for the provision and management of services. That will be particularly necessary where smaller authorities find they are unable to provide efficient and effective delivery of a range of services.<br><br>
This is a bit boring—I shall come to the interesting part later.<br><br>
The Government suggested in the White Paper that many people feel distant from their local authorities and do not understand their roles—a view that is not supported by independent research. Clearly, the setting up of numerous joint arrangements for different service areas could lead to increased confusion for the public about the way in which services are provided and who is responsible for service delivery.<br><br>
Joint arrangements prejudice local accountability and the ability to respond quickly to local needs. It is therefore important that, where joint arrangements are necessary to facilitate service provision, the public are fully informed of and consulted about those new arrangements from the outset. That would ensure—I am getting worked up—that they are made aware of the process and any new arrangements that are proposed. It would provide the opportunity for the public to contribute to the process through consultation. I hope that the Minister is now fully aware of the purpose of the amendment and the effect that it would have.<br><br>
I did not speak about staff and property. The subject of property was dealt with brilliantly by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. My reason for not speaking was not that I thought the matter unimportant, but that my hon. Friend dealt with it. However I feel constrained to make several comments on the clauses before the Committee.<br><br>
Two key clauses expose the problems and deficiencies of the Bill. A comparison of the Government's account of the purpose of the Bill with the reality shows an enormous gap. The Government say that they are moving local government towards a one-tier system. Nothing could be further from the truth, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian rightly suggests. We are being given a multi-tiered system. I am not sure whether there are three, four or five tiers. I shall examine them with reference to my area. I know the Ayrshire area as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East knows the Tayside area.<br><br>
Ayrshire will have three local authorities—North, East and South Ayrshire—if that plan goes ahead. I hope that it will not and that an all-Ayrshire authority will be accepted on Report. The health board will operate on an all-Ayrshire basis and so will the enterprise company,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 652</span>
but fire and police will continue to be organised on a Strathclyde basis. Water and sewerage will be administered by one of three boards, covering between them the whole of Scotland—and the west, in Ayrshire's case. Public transport, as I understand matters, will remain with the Strathclyde passenger transport executive, which does not cover the whole of Strathclyde. I reckon that we shall have, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, a four-tier system. That is a dog's breakfast—a recipe for chaos and confusion. Overlaps will make joint working very difficult.<br><br>
I spoke last night to the director of social work for Strathclyde, Mary Hartnoll, for whom I have the greatest respect. I worked with her when I was at Age Concern and she was director of social work for Grampian. She is one of the most respected social workers in the United Kingdom. She is deeply concerned, given the chaos that will be caused, about what will happen when the health board and the new councils work together. That is why there should be consultation and advertising. The public needs to know about the problems.<br><br>
The very fact that joint boards and joint committees are needed—clause 56 provides for joint working committees and clauses 20 and 21 deal with joint boards—is an admission of failure. The Government have failed to devise a workable scheme. Labour Members have been arguing for some contiguity and exactitude between the boundaries of the local authorities and those of the organisations, such as the health board and the enterprise companies, with which they will work.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
Let us briefly examine some of the problems that will arise over the joint boards. Theoretically, they could work reasonably well, although they would still have many problems if there was political homogeneity between three authorities. Let us assume that three authorities in Ayrshire had to work together to provide a decent education service, with specialist services to which my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East referred. I shall not describe the range of services in detail.<br><br>
If all three authorities were Labour controlled, there could be a joint arrangement in understanding their proposed policies. There would still be problems, which I shall describe in a moment, but there would not be so much difficulty. If, heaven forbid, the Kyle and Carrick local authority, which my hon. Member for Falkirk, East said wins the gold medal in the loony Olympics, were to remain Tory controlled when it becomes South Ayrshire, it would be much more difficult for the two remaining Labour-controlled authorities. If North Ayrshire and East Ayrshire were to remain Labour controlled, it would be difficult for them to work in a joint arrangement with South Ayrshire. That is the first difficulty. If they are politically homogeneous, there is a possibility of their working together. If there is not that political homogeneity, it will be very difficult.<br><br>
The second problem is deciding where the buck stops. I had experience in the Lothian and Borders police and fire board. I remember that all the Borders people did not want to pay the money, yet they wanted the services, such as the police.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is far less crime in the Borders than in Lothian, so we need fewer police and, therefore, want to pay less money?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 653</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a strange thought. I thought that the reason for less crime was that the Borders was well policed. My hon. Friend, and he is my hon. Friend, makes a point.<br><br>
I know that conflict arises over joint frontiers. People always want to get more services, but do not want to pay for them. I chose the Borders because I knew that example. There is a constant passing of the buck.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point, and it is shared by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson). Recently on Grampian television he said that the people of West Hill wanted urban services at rural rates. Therefore, he can appreciate the validity of my hon. Friend's argument. People want the services, but they want somebody else to pay for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South can see the validity of the argument, it must be a simple argument.<br><br>
My third point involves another sort of accountability—democratic accountability. I understood that the purpose of elected councils, as opposed to the quangos that hon. Members are discussing in the Chamber, was to achieve democratic accountability. Every three years—or, in this case, four years—the electorate could review the authority's record and say, "Well, we don't like what it did. We'll throw it out and bring in another one." That is the whole purpose of elections. I remember in the old Edinburgh corporation days, we had a debate on whether the rates should be increased. We were worried that if we increased them too much, we might not continue to be re-elected. The council made a conscious decision that if it put the rates up, it had to justify its action to the electorate by telling them what they were getting in return for the increase.<br><br>
If a single council provides all the services, as I was arguing in the case of Ayrshire, it should be responsible for taking the decisions. If it was not liked, it could be voted out of office after four years. Where is the accountability with joint boards? People will pass the buck from one authority to another. There will be no clear arrangements for democratic accountability. That is the third reason for not having joint boards and for public consultation and discussion.<br><br>
The fourth reason concerns premises and staff. I am not sure what will happen about ownership in relation to joint boards. Does one authority have responsibility or will the joint boards be responsible? That is a grey area. If there are joint arrangements, who will own the premises and for whom will the staff work? Will the staff work for the council in whose area they are active, or for the joint board? That is the fourth argument against joint boards.<br><br>
Fifthly, decision making will be slow and expensive. We shall end up with two-phase decision making. Let us take the example of Ayrshire. The three councils will meet to discuss what they want the joint board to do. That is a recipe for delay and for extra expenditure and is the fifth argument against joint boards.<br><br>
The more we examine the Bill clause by clause, the more we see its flaws and fissures. Reason upon reason is piling up for not implementing the provisions in the Bill.<br><br>
I thank Strathclyde regional council for some of the information that I have used in this short speech. Over
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 654</span>
the past few days and weeks, I have met representatives of Strathclyde and Lothian regions. In all our discussions, those councillors have expressed concern about the continuation of service provision. They are worried about the deterioration of education and social work services and have made arguments, which we can use in Committee, for protecting those services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Throughout our sittings, the hon. Gentleman has criticised me for meeting members of other authorities. I now find that he has been skulking round the Corridors, meeting representatives of Lothian region, That is a surprising revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had the opportunity of talking to Strathclyde councillors. I represent a Strathclyde constituency. My discussions with Strathclyde and Lothian councillors concerned not the narrow, parochial interests that the hon. Member for Ayr has always expressed but how to deal with the flaws and fissures in the Bill. That applies throughout Scotland: it applies in Aberdeen, in Edinburgh, in Glasgow and in Cumnock just as much as it does anywhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister sees a wee seam to explore.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A large one. The hon. Gentleman is saying that although he has every right to meet Lothian councillors to discuss important matters, it is wholly wrong for my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr to meet, at their request, councillors from another council. We have had endless points of order about that. The hon. Gentleman must surely concede that he is not on strong ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. What do meetings have to do with the amendment? I hope that we do not start discussing meetings with councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right, Mr. Martin. I want to say one relevant thing. <i>[Laughter.]</i> One further relevant thing. The people to whom I talked last night were officials representing the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland and the Association of Directors of Social Work.<br><br>
I was not going to mention the matter, but now that it has arisen I should say that the discussion took place over dinner in the Churchill Room. Lo and behold, whom did I see there but the hon. Member for Ayr with officials from Scottish Power and the. hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs). It was interesting to see the hon. Member for Ayr pursuing his commercial interests when I was pursuing my political interests. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is okay. I am just giving an account of what happened. I shall return to discussing the point that I was making before I foolishly gave way to the hon. Member for Ayr.<br><br>
The Strathclyde and the Lothian councillors and, to their credit, the Strathclyde and the Lothian officials gave us information about service provision and continue to do so, even though many of them could lose their jobs and be substantially disadvantaged by what is in the Bill. When the councillors from West Lothian, Cunninghame and Inverclyde were here, all that they were interested in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 655</span>
was self-preservation. That is an interesting comparison. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given the hon. Member some leeway, but the discussion is going away from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is, but I am returning to it because I am concluding.<br><br>
The Bill puts services under threat—education, social work and others that I have not mentioned such as highways, roads and regional services. The joint boards, which have been discussed by me and by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, serve to turn the spotlight on the way in which services are under threat. I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for informing me how Scottish Power was entertaining the hon. Member for Ayr last night. I, too, met its representatives last night. I am keen to protect jobs in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have said that we shall not discuss meetings with Scottish Power or with any other organisation. We are going to talk about the amendment. That is the only thing that has not been discussed this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has got away with a great deal. He had a clause stand part debate, but now we shall discuss the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. A comment was made that I was being entertained by Scottish Power last night. It was untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That can be taken up at another time with the hon. Member who made it. We have to get on with discussing the amendment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. Whether something has been put on the record is irrelevant. I have ruled that these matters have nothing to do with the amendment. I do not want an hon. Member rebutting statements that are out of order anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On point of order, Mr. Martin. When a member of the Committee regularly contravenes the rules and strays from the matter that is being debated—the amendment—is it in order? What can other hon. Members do to ensure that he does not continue to transgress?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should give me the credit for conducting proceedings in a proper manner. That is the end of that. I want to hear about the amendment.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking forward to the meal that I shall get some time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 656</span>
The amendment proposes consultations about appointments to joint boards. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) spoke about his experiences in local government and his anxiety about the joint boards' lack of accountability.<br><br>
My experience of local government is not as extensive as my hon. Friend's. The nearest I came to a joint board in my brief spell as a member of Berwickshire district council was my appointment to the Tweed river purification board, a quasi-joint board. A range of district councils and Borders regional council were represented on that board.<br><br>
The body had a life of its own. The presence of elected councillors conferred on it a sort of nominal democratic credibility, but in fact it was just another quango; democratic accountability was pretty thin.<br><br>
The joint boards are fundamentally unaccountable, unsatisfactory and undemocratic bodies. People do not have access to them through their elected local councillors. The boards are not required to report to the parent authorities. The joint board is, in effect, a pseudo quango.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred to the Lothian and Borders police board, but he could have made the same point about the Lothian and Borders fire board. The existing joint boards serving two local authorities levy their respective councils for contributions to the running of services and allocate resources to the two areas on the basis of need. That has been a recipe for difficulties over the years. The little spat between my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire showed that there is ill feeling on both sides about how the existing joint boards function. Each local authority feels that it pays too much and gets too little in return. That is fundamentally unsatisfactory and there has been endless whingeing, especially by the Borders authority councillors.<br><br>
I have the misfortune to have to read the nonsense in the Borders local press. A couple of years ago, it was reported that Borders councillors were undermining the position of the chief constable by threatening to opt out.<br><br>
In future, many smaller councils will have to appoint more joint boards to oversee and administer the delivery of important services. My hon. Friend gave specific examples, but probably the most sensitive and difficult to provide are education services such as further and special education. At present, constituents who have difficulty finding suitable education places for handicapped and deaf children and children with special needs have direct access to a regional councillor, who in turn has direct access to the education department that can do something about the problem. It will be much more difficult to solve such problems second hand, via joint boards, which are not directly accountable to the electorate.<br><br>
Regional councils deliver many other services very efficiently. Trading standards officials, for example, are directly accountable but they will have to deal with problems second hand when the joint boards are established. Planning will be even more complicated and so will the management of highways and other roads. At present, there is a co-ordinated arrangement for clearing snow and salting the roads. Those services are provided
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 657</span>
in the areas where they are most urgently needed. Smaller departments in smaller areas will not be able to call in back-up services from other parts of the region as they do now.<br><br>
The town of Haddington in my constituency is prone to severe flooding because it is in a low-lying area. When that happens, Lothian regional council brings in highway department employees from all over the region to help with pumping, laying sandbags and so on to cope with the temporary crisis. The new local authority for that area will have great difficulty in sustaining that kind of surge requirement for labour. There may have to be a joint authority for highways work, but how will it operate? Will it ensure that the people of Haddington get the back-up that they need, and when they need it? I doubt it.<br><br>
Let us consider cultural services in the Lothian region. How will the Edinburgh festival be affected by the new set-up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's speech but I find it difficult to understand the connection between what he says and the amendment, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"insert 'after having advertised the proposal and having considered any representations … within an eight week period …'".</p></blockquote>
Will the hon. Member please explain the logic of his argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) seems to want your job, Mr. Martin. If he hangs on long enough, he could find his way on to the Chairmen's panel. If I had been out of order, you would have told me, Mr. Martin. The hon. Gentleman is a bit slow on the uptake but he may grasp the point that before establishing joint boards, which will not be directly accountable to the public there should be maximum public consultation. The trouble is that there will be no alternative to these bodies.<br><br>
The Edinburgh international festival is currently funded mainly by local authorities. It receives £850,000 from the Edinburgh City district council; £250,000 a year from Lothian regional council and £650,000 from the Scottish Arts Council. That quarter of a million pounds is absolutely crucial. Does the Minister have in mind a joint board involving all the local authorities in the Lothian area to provide funding for the Edinburgh international festival?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman tell me when the Edinburgh festival started?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not off the cuff. It has been going for many years and has been a tremendous success which is of great value to Edinburgh, to Lothian to Scotland and to the United Kingdom as a whole. The funding package that I described is essential</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but does not he recollect that the Edinburgh festival was set up under the single-tier Edinburgh City council of old?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but had it not been for additional support from Lothian region, the Edinburgh festival would have foundered. If the function is to be sustained, a joint board must be set up to levy the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
neighbouring local authorities. That will be difficult. Council taxpayers in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow may not be too keen on being levied. The Glasgow Citizens' threatre is funded largely by Glasgow district council but it receives £200,000 a year from Strathclyde regional council. Is the Minister confident that the new East Renfrewshire council will chip in its share of that budget?<br><br>
Will there be joint boards for those purposes? What consultation will take place before the joint boards are established? Regional government in Scotland works very well in sustaining vital services that need strategic co-operation over large areas. If the regional government is fragmented, it will be necessary to establish joint boards to sustain the services that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the amendment calls for an eight-week period to allow the proposal to be discussed locally. If councils made up of elected people decide to create a joint board, is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that that decision should be discussed locally?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There should be maximum public awareness. It would be far better to consult locally now. Members of Parliament, both Scottish and English, who are following our proceedings must grasp the fact that the Government's proposals are unworkable. They will give rise to all sorts of difficulties and should be thrown out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Raymond S. Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is tripe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is well known for his profound contributions to the Committee. Does he suggest that the joint boards providing fire services and police services between Lothian and Border regions have been a total success with which everyone is happy? Clearly, the hon. Gentleman has not got a clue. I can tell him that I know, as a Lothian Member of Parliament and a resident of the Borders, that the joint boards are not satisfactory. We are drifting into needing many more joint boards—for further education, for strategic planning, for transport and many other matters. There will be a lack of accountability, and waste.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background noise does not help either, especially in this small Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require the proposal to establish joint boards to be advertised, and proper consultation before such boards are established. It would be far better if the establishment of joint boards did not need to be proposed. Joint boards are an unaccountable and fundamentally unsatisfactory arrangement, and there must be genuine consultation before important services are transferred to them. Without that consultation, it should not be possible to go ahead with establishing joint boards. Joint boards are not the right way to deliver important services in Scotland. The Minister should desist from implementing the Bill altogether.</span></p>

<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER <i>in the Chair]</i> 9 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Joint boards do not sit comfortably with compulsory competitive tendering legislation. Has that been considered? There may be difficulties in splitting the client and contractor functions of joint boards. Will the Minister comment on that? What will happen when there are disagreements about the transfer of property?<br><br>
The regional council in Lothian provides clear and accountable local government. The intention of reorganisation set out in the White Paper indicated the Government's belief that
<br><blockquote><p>"Many people feel distant from their local authorities and do not understand their roles."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister explain how a plethora of joint boards and committees will achieve the aim of clarifying for the public who is responsible and accountable for service delivery? Can the Minister foresee joint committees or joint boards operating on a basis outwith a shared boundary other than non-land boundaries—for example, East and West Lothian; East, Mid and West Lothian; Fife and West Lothian; Fife and Dundee? Can the Minister foresee joint arrangements for different functions, such as social work? West Lothian may join Central for industrial development but may choose to join Edinburgh for other matters. How does that equate with a concept of a single tier with the aim of providing the public with a clear and unambiguous service delivery? Is that principle to be sacrificed for economy of scale? If so, why have boundaries that produce such unviable population bases in some new authorities? It is a matter of cost versus principle.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain how joint boards and committees will be able to respond more quickly than existing authorities to local needs? The curfew has expired on that. These are important questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Chair, Sir James. You missed a quite bizarre debate before dinner.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
The amendment before us is extremely limited. It refers to consultation and advertising. During the long debate before dinner, no hon. Member spoke out of order—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that my co-Chairman allowed that debate to run widely because he perhaps regarded it as a stand part debate and was trying to be helpful to all members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Your co-Chairman, Sir James, is always universally helpful to the Committee. In many years of attending Committees, I do not recall a sitting when a Chairman has so often had to ask hon. Members to relate their remarks more closely to the amendment under discussion. Of course, hon. Members were entirely in order. We were spared, by the excellent rulings of your co-Chairman, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley giving us what he doubtless intended—a speech of about an hour and a half on where we had all dined yesterday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech was exactly the length that I had intended it to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How long will this one be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members raised so many wide-ranging matters in the debate that I shall try to answer some of them.<br><br>
It was interesting that, during the debate on this limited amendment relating to advertising and eight-week periods, the hon. Member for East Lothian gave us extended history of the Edinburgh festival. He rightly referred to the Tweed river purification board on which he had served—presumably representing millionaire landowners, as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I know, I was the only millionaire landowner who lived in that ward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously keeps everyone else in the ward down so that he is the only millionaire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister think that perhaps the hon. Gentleman was just representing public schoolboys?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's suggestion, and I shall refer to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley as representing millionaire landowners and public schoolboys on the river purification board.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East did not attempt to speak to the amendment and when I asked the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley to justify the amendment, he read out impeccably the brief that had been supplied to hon. Members. I do not criticise him for that; it is standard practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Minister is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not. The hon. Gentleman read out the brief, but he did not explain how the amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
would work. My hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside asked the hon. Member for East Lothian to explain how the amendment would work, but he muttered a couple of words about consultation and then went back to referring to the Edinburgh festival. Opposition Members gave an astonishing exhibition and I cannot explain why they took such an enormous length of time—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members should not laugh when the Minister is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an astonishingly lengthy debate on a limited amendment that has not been explained to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill gives the Secretary of State powers to establish joint boards and allows him to make an order dealing with
<br><blockquote><p>"matters relating to the membership of the joint board".</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that the Bill would not allow the Secretary of State to appoint members, but it does allow him to deal with matters affecting membership. Will the Minister explain what that means? Why does the Secretary of State need such a power, and to what use does he expect to put it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to explain that, but the subject comes up under a later amendment. You may rule me out of order, Sir James, if I respond to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I intend to move most of the amendments formally, I should be grateful if the Minister would take this opportunity to explain the point made by the hon. Member for Angus. East.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the point when we reach the amendments. If the hon. Gentleman wants to move them formally, that is a matter for him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are grouped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not with this amendment. I recommend the hon. Gentleman to read the list of selected amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important, Sir James, to reiterate what your co-Chairman said when he made it clear during a broad debate on a narrow amendment that he was being flexible to reflect the fact that it was a broader debate than that represented by the narrow amendment. The Minister should not make too much of a meal of a broad debate on one particular amendment. It had a clear purpose, which Mr. Martin saw even if the Minister missed it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am the last person to comment on the rulings of the Chairman, which are always correct, but I recall that Mr. Martin criticised an Opposition Member for making a clause stand part speech rather than a speech on the specific amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am in no way criticising the Chair, but I think that <i>Hansard</i> will show that the Chairman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
criticised an hon. Member and, quite rightly, told him to return to the amendment. I will stand corrected if I am wrong.<br><br>
The amendment, although attractive in principle, has considerable problems. Opposition Members say that they want local authorities to advertise, but they do not say what the cost of such advertising would be, nor where and how often local authorities would be obliged to advertise. It is astonishing that such very simple questions have not been answered in our lengthy debate.<br><br>
May I strain your patience, Sir James, by answering some general points? We have approached the reoganisation with the belief that the introduction of the new unitary councils will assist the continuing improvement in service standards. We therefore wish to give unitary councils a high degree of flexibility in how they achieve that.<br><br>
Opposition Members seem to believe that the idea of joint arrangements is anathema to local authorities. That is nonsense. We had a consultation exercise on internal management, not necessarily related to the reorganisation of local government. The results of that exercise made it clear that the vast majority of local authorities in Scotland welcome the opportunity to establish joint boards under secondary legislation. Of 115 responses, mostly from local authorities, 89 supported local authorities having that right, of which Opposition Members are so critical. They say that joint boards and joint arrangements will present enormous difficulties. Borders regional council, which has a population of 100,000, manages to operate perfectly successfully under the existing structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the document produced by the Labour party in Scotland on the future of local government is very explicit on joint boards and arrangements? Indeed, it goes so far as to say that under Labour's proposed system of single-tier authorities, joint boards and joint arrangements will be needed to cover certain services in certain parts of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is becoming increasingly clear, as the Bill proceeds through Committee, that Opposition Members not only depart from the views expressed in the document but regard the reasoned representations of many smaller Labour-led district councils with total and utter contempt, which has been displayed openly. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley was proud to put on the record his contempt for the representations that we received from a number of Labour-led district councils. Even councils as small as Clackmannan have argued reasonably that they can deliver services effectively by use of the voluntary sector and joint arrangements. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Is the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) criticising the reasoned representations that we have received from these Labour district councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the joint arrangements for different functions? That is of considerable concern to Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who made a short but relevant contribution to the debate—in marked contrast to those who preceded him—asks a perfectly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
reasonable question. There are already many examples of successful snaring of specialist expertise without the need for joint boards. The islands councils, of course, are already experienced in that espect, and they have much smaller populations than any of the mainland councils proposed in the Bill. Other examples include that of public analyst—four centres provide services for all Scottish authorities. There are various specialist education facilities, and so on. There are examples of joint arrangements working successfully throughout Scotland.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
The Committee is being asked to agree to the amendment's proposal on advertising and consultation. I understand the purpose of the proposal, but Opposition Members have not even begun to explain its mechanics. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
In more general terms, clause 20 gives the Secretary of State the power to establish joint boards in response to representations received from the local authorities concerned. The process cannot be triggered without the local authorities requesting it. In our consultation process, 89 of the 115 responses were in favour, representing three quarters or more of the local authorities in Scotland. This is a perfectly reasonable proposition, which the Committee should accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As ever, I remain completely unconvinced by the pathetic rambling of the Minister and his hon. Friends. However, in order to facilitate progress on the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 202, in page 16, line 38, after "shall", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"be in terms agreed with the relevant authorities and shall".—<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 207, in page 17, line 45, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"unless the Secretary of State has consulted", and insert "except with the agreement of.—<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will need to check with the parliamentary draftsman, but I accept the purpose of amendment No. 202 in principle. I cannot, however, for a number of reasons, agree to amendment No. 207, which I believe would lead to an unsatisfactory outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle of amendment No. 202. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 204, in page 17, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) A Joint Board established under this section shall consist of such numbers of members appointed respectively by the relevant authorities from among their own members as may be specified in an order made under subsection (1) above.".—<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on this point, which he raised earlier. Members of joint boards
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
can only be appointees of local authorities. They cannot be appointees of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is now appropriate, can the Minister answer my earlier question? The Secretary of State can, by order, effectively deal with matters relating to membership of the joint boards. He may not appoint the members, but he deals with them once they are appointed. Why does the Secretary of State need that power, and to what use does the Minister expect him to put it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Secretary of State needs to have powers regarding his relationship with joint boards. I am not entirely clear what problem the hon. Gentleman is referring to. I emphasise that the Secretary of State will play no part in selecting board members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By order, which is secondary legislation, the Secretary of State can deal with matters relating to membership of the joint boards. That gives him carte blanche. What on earth is that power for, and how will the Secretary of State use it? There is clearly some reasoning behind the provision of such a draconian power. The Secretary of State can deal with any matters relating to any member of any joint board, and he can do so under secondary legislation. I seek an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I now have an answer to his question. The Secretary of State has reserve powers by order, for example, to set down the number of representatives of each constituent authority of the joint board. The members of the joint board will be appointed by the local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a large authority and a small authority came together to provide a joint service, could the Secretary of State determine that membership of the board should be 50:50—equal shares—even though one council was much larger than the other and contributed more money to running the services of which it was making greater demands? In those circumstances, that would be unfair. Alternatively, would arrangements be on a pro rata basis? What are the Government's intentions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stress that the Secretary of State's powers can be taken only if the local authorities request the establishment of joint boards. Membership will be decided after consultation with the authorities involved. If the hon. Gentleman wants a general idea of the Government's intentions, which is reasonable, I must say that, broadly, we envisage the numbers on joint boards being on a pro rata basis. For obvious reasons, it may not be possible to commit to an exact arithmetic calculation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his response to the amendment, but I should like further clarification on one point. Is it the Government's intention that only elected members of the constituent authorities can serve on the joint boards or is the Minister suggesting that unelected members can serve?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks a good question. As drafted, the clause allows authorities to appoint non-members to a joint board; it does not specify that they must be councillors. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that there should be such a restriction?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 665</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to withdraw the amendment if the Minister can assure us that only elected, and not unelected, members can serve on the joint boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to consider that. I have a slight reservation: local authorities may, in certain circumstances, want to appoint to the boards senior officials rather than elected members. Local authorities have the discretion. As I have no strong views on that question, I am happy to examine it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the proposals for the membership of education authorities, it would be dangerous in some circumstances to specify elected members only. Some members of the education authorities will not be elected members. I am thinking particularly of Church representatives and of other representatives who are added later. It may be useful for such people to be eligible for membership of joint boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the basis that local authorities will have the discretion to decide the membership of joint boards, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made.</i> No. 56, in page 18, line 6, after "section", insert
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
<br><blockquote><p>", or section 62A or 62B of this Act,".—<i>[Mr. Stewart.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 208, in page 18, line 19, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"62D. Requisitions made by Joint Boards from constituent local authorities will be disregarded for capping purposes when the capping levels of the constituent authorities are being determined by the Secretary of State for Scotland.".—<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to be helpful. I would like to know why the Minister cannot commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been helpful to the Committee if the hon. Gentleman had explained why he had tabled it. The amendment refers to the capping limits of joint boards. I refer him to the relevant primary legislation, which, as he will know from the extensive research that he made for the speech that he has just made, is set out in section 58 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. That section relates to joint boards.<br><br>
Under that section, arrangements on funding are to be decided by the constituent councils, with the Secretary of State being available to arbitrate in the absence of any agreement. It would be open to councils on a joint board to agree on a funding formula that reflects the service priority decisions of the constituent authorities.<br><br>
With these reassuring words, I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having been sufficiently reassured by the Minister's persuasive words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is important. I want to highlight concerns about how the joint boards will deliver community care services. Put simply, there is a real fear that many of the new councils will not be big enough to deliver effective community care services. That is especially true for people whose needs are specialised or unusual. Examples include people who have profound learning disabilities, who are deaf and blind or who have rare physical disorders.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
It is expensive to provide a high-quality service to those groups. The expense can be borne within a reasonably large authority more easily than within a small one, where a few clients with intensive needs may make a significant difference to the budget.<br><br>
However, the question is not just of cost, but of expertise. A larger region is far more likely to be able to run central support services to allow people to receive appropriate care in their area.<br><br>
Presumably it is because of those types of problems that the clause allows the Secretary of State to establish joint boards, but how will they operate? Can they be established in respect of particular community care services, or would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
they have to take overall responsibility for social work? If a board does not take over all social work services, what will happen to a client whose needs do not fit its remit?<br><br>
If a board takes over everything run by a social work department, those services that can be effectively delivered locally will be hived off into a new and less democratic structure. If joint boards are established to run community care, will the Government monitor the delivery of services to people with specialised needs? Will they be prepared to use their powers of direction if people do not receive an adequate service?<br><br>
Even at this time of night, I feel strongly about the matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian knows, the issue for people in the east of Scotland is the bust-up, the unpicking of the excellent Lothian social work department. I look on it with dismay on behalf of my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the worries that have been expressed by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, but do not accept the doom and gloom, of Labour Members. Nor do I think that Edinburgh would be incapable of running the Edinburgh festival.<br><br>
Joint boards are perfectly acceptable and well established in Scottish local government. I have nothing against them in theory or in practice when they are freely entered into by local authorities which, in their judgment, believe them to be appropriate to local circumstances.<br><br>
I supported amendments that provided for extended consultation or local government rights, and am wary of the Government's intentions and of powers conferred by the Bill. However, joint boards should not pose problems for the new system. They might solve problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful for the commonsense speech of the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh).<br><br>
I shall respond briefly to the questions of the hon. Member for Linlithgow. Joint boards will be able to take over either whole or part functions, depending on the wishes of the local authorities. He asked whether the Secretary of State would, if necessary, use his reserve powers. The answer is yes.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 217, in page 18, line 29, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Local authorities shall produce a scheme for consultation on all policy areas to ensure that the views of community councils are sought and reported to the full council meeting or the appropriate council committee which has delegated powers on any policy area before the council policies are agreed.".</p></blockquote>
I have waited quite a while to speak to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has done well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South, says that I have done well. I am pleased because that, in Labour party terminology, is a gold star in the book. I note that senior members of the Labour Bench have arrived, knowing that this important subject was to be discussed. I do not know whether it has been decided that we go home at 10 o'clock. I remember that in a previous Committee I was encouraged to speak at great length as late as this to ensure that members of the Committee did not go home. Anyone in that frame of mind might care to know that the American artist, Ruth Brown, who is singing in London for a fortnight, sang last Thursday and I saw her then, so I have nowhere to go but to my bed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a shame. I am sure that the Whips will indicate a little nearer the time whether hon. Members want to go at 10 o'clock.<br><br>
The amendment would allow us to discover whether the Government are serious about the role of community councils and about local representation. We know that the small kernel of truth in the Government's comments about local government which has caused them to introduce this gargantuan and ill-advised Bill is that local government is not close enough to the people and does not take account of people's representations.<br><br>
In earlier debates we discussed the balance between the scale—or, as the hon. Member for Ayr would say, "scale of size"—of economies made by local authorities in delivering services, and the other reason for their existence—which is representing the people democratically. There was a consensus in the Committee about what we meant, which was that people should know that, when they expressed their views, they were carried, by elected representatives or by those in the communities, to the point at which a rational decision was arrived at and they received services that they vote and pay for. The Government now have an opportunity to prove whether they take the subject seriously.<br><br>
The notes on clause 22 shows that the only firm change from the 1973 Act is that under subsection (3), there is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
no requirement for a community council scheme to be reported to the Secretary of State. I recall that, when community councils were being set up, people moved about local communities trying to focus on the correct scheme for their areas, on whether there should be a community council or amalgamation with another community, as they perceived it, "down the road, or across the stream or river or across the bridge."<br><br>
Taking the matter seriously, as I always do, and ignoring the hubbub from the Public Gallery, I went—as all of us should—to read what the Wheatley commission said on the subject. Wheatley mentioned four levels of community and identified community somewhere about parish level in Scotland. "The parish" will be well known to people in Scotland who are of a certain age because it was the name for what was basically the social security system. People went "on the parish" if they were impoverished. They were given parish boots, I am told, and punched holes in them so that they were seen to be parish boots. If people walked in the snow, it melted inside the boots. So as well as having parish boots for all to see, they got wet feet. My late father told me that used to walk to school in his bare feet rather than wear parish boots. The Government, apart from considering parishes under the Bill, seem determined to put most of the people of Scotland back on "the parish" with what they are doing to the Scottish economy.<br><br>
Wheatley talked about the parish and about identifying 878 parishes in Scotland. Chapter 22, paragraphs 717 to 719, speaks about the necessity of having some form of representative expression of local opinion, and it identified parishes. Wheatley went even further. It recommended that
<br><blockquote><p>"one must go to the lower end of the 'locality' range and even to the 'parish' which was the fourth level of communities identified in Chapter 19."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 718 it said that the community councils would have no functions but
<br><blockquote><p>"would possess…a statutory representative role and power to do certain things in the interests of the local community."</p></blockquote>
Sadly, if one reads the history of what has happened to local community representation through community councils since 1973, I have to agree entirely with the excellent short briefing from the Association of Scottish Community Councils. It says that it identified in researches
<br><blockquote><p>"the failure of local authorities to consult or provide resources which has been the main factor inhibiting the development of community councils in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
That is the reality. The idea that we could create community interest at a local level has not achieved the level of seriousness or importance in local authorities that it should. By accepting our amendment, the Government have a chance to give them the statutory right to be consulted and to have their views reported to the appropriate committee or full council meeting before the council takes its decision. That would not mean that the local representation should hold sway in every discussion of the local council or of the unitary authority. But it would at least be reported. It would at least give them a reason to exist, a reason that on many occasions we have found very worth while.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South suggested that the scheme should ensure the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
representation of all sections of the population. I think that that is important too. Where there is a community in a geographical sense, if it contains an ethnic minority or a group of people with a particular unity of purpose they should also be represented.<br><br>
Amendment No. 218 seeks to delete three fines. I shall not speak at length on it but I hope to move it formally later. The idea that it is possible to do away with a community's right to be represented is extremely damaging. It is pernicious to say, as the clause does, that where a local authority considers that a community council is unnecessary it can remove the community's right to have such a council. It shows the Government's willingness to face both directions here. They say that there will be a scheme that no longer has to have the approval of the Secretary of State, and that it can contain the power to abolish or not set up a community council. The Government should accept the amendment and bring us all into line. Community councils can be important if we give them importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the important roles of community councils is ascertaining the views of local people on such things as the frequency and punctuality of rail services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given what is likely to happen in the passenger transport executive areas—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has his mind on the times of trains to Scotland.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I noted that some people from the midlands are worried that their 11.40 service will be withdrawn. I am sure that members of the Committee would be equally upset if the 11.35 or 11.50 services were withdrawn, as they might use those services to go home.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
To return to the point: community councils do get consulted about local train services in Scotland. Some Conservative Members may not know that ScotRail has been undertaking a programme of extending rail services by returning rail stations to communities. An example of that is the commuter community of Dunblane in Stirling district, where my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) has his residence. My hon. Friend has his finger on the pulse in his area. He has been commended by the local newspaper for describing the madness of what the local district council is up to, now that it has fallen into the hands of the Conservatives after the cut of the cards at the previous election.<br><br>
Community councils in Scotland soldier on regardless of the terrible disdain with which they are treated by local councils. My local community of Bo'ness, a former town with its own proud heritage, has a community council whose long-serving chairman William Rodgers, has just been given the MBE for services to the local community. He has not served on an elected council since the reorganisation but has been a community councillor. The town of Grangemouth, where the largest petrochemical plant in Scotland is to be found, has a community council
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
that speaks for the community with one voice. It is important that community councils be given a statutory right to be consulted. They deserve it. That would give us credibility with the public and show that we are doing something on their behalf.<br><br>
Finally, the Minister has received a copy of the report from the Association of Scottish Community Councils. That organisation has a raft of amendments about financing, and other matters. We have tabled just one symbolic but important amendment, which would ensure that community councils would have the right to be consulted. A later amendment, No. 211, would ensure that all sections of the community are represented in that process. I hope that the Minister will show that he has listened to the association.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Falkirk, East about the importance of community councils. The hon. Gentleman said that he was going to move amendment no. 218 formally—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Minister responds in full, may I say that I have some sympathy with the comments of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. Community councils have played a vital role in Scotland and I hope that my hon. Friend will recognise that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There seems to be a consensus in the Committee about the importance of community councils. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East will understand that, however well meant it is, amendment No. 218, which deals with the representation of all sections of the population, would be technically difficult to enforce. It would place a statutory duty on the new authorities to produce a scheme for consultation on all policy areas to ensure that the views of community councils are sought.<br><br>
That goes too far. It would create a second tier of local government and would not be welcomed by local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
authorities. However, I emphasise the importance of community councils. They will be consulted on decentralisation schemes under the Bill and the Government envisage that community councils will have extra legal rights to consultation on planning matters in the future.<br><br>
I do not disageree with the general comments of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, but the amendment goes too far.</span></p>
