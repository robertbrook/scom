	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have strict instructions from the Whip to finish speaking at 16.32, but no doubt he will extend that to 16.33, given that there was a point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before lunch, I said that the debate should focus on how best to keep down the rising bill. No one in Committee denies that bills for Scotland's water and sewerage services will rise. The debate should be about how best we can contain that increase and how cost effectively we can deliver the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disappointing that the Opposition will not join the debate on those terms. For the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), this debate and the charade last week have little to do with the future of Scotland's water and sewerage industry, but have everything to do with shoring up support, by COSLA and constituency Labour parties throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are reliably informed by BBC Reporting Scotland that those bodies are far from impressed by the Opposition's behaviour and their opposition to the Bill. It was interesting that, last Thursday, the hon. Member for Hamilton directly quoted Reporting Scotland. Plainly, he believed it to be objective and truthful in its reporting. Reporting Scotland has said that the Labour party in Scotland is far from impressed by the Opposition's performance on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that it is a coincidence that since he took over as a vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party, the party's support in opinion polls in Scotland has been reduced to 13 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall gladly have my record as vice-chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland judged on our performance at the next general election because that is what we are working towards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton, in his opposition and in how he has conducted matters, has put his own interests first. He has walked away from the argument. He has used scaremongering and rumourmongering tactics to spread falsehoods and half truths to scare the most vulnerable in society. He has run with stories that he knows are not true. We have not responded with like with like, but if the hon. Gentleman's chosen battleground is the gutter, so be it. We shall take him on, on his terms, and he will regret pursuing such a course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a helpful sequel to the seminar on the economics of water and sewerage from the north Tayside school of economics. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was reinforcing the message by the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) about local authority councillors who are not up to the job of managing water and sewerage services and investing in the future. He repeatedly told us that extra resources had to be invested in those vital services. We all agree with that, but he failed to explain why the well-tried existing structure should not be allowed to continue to do the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One reason that the hon. Gentleman might consider is that we must now embark on a significant programme of capital
	<span class='label label-info column'>1582</span>
expenditure. Units of the present size are likely to be less able to manage such a programme efficiently. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), who is trying to interrupt this intervention, has probably never taken on a capital programme of that size. Anyone who has operated in such an engineering programme will appreciate that a fairly large unit is needed to integrate the services and to get going and carry through a proper capital investment programme. Will the hon. Gentleman consider the need to rationalise the larger authorities to make the programme work effectively in the interests of the consumer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that the interests of the consumer should be the highest priority. There have been interesting discussions about whether the taxpayer or the consumer should pay. I have yet to understand the distinction between the taxpayer and the consumer of water because, as far as I know, absolutely everybody must consume water and make use of the services. Taxes are generally assessed in a progressive manner so that those who can afford to pay more, do pay more. The danger of this type of restructuring is that consumers of water will have to pay in accordance with their consumption, which takes no account of their ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's specific point about the scale of the water and sewerage undertakings, I must tell him that the 12 existing authorities have a wealth of experience in quality work. There is no justification for establishing bigger quangos as the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case made by the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) this morning was less than convincing. I suspect that that might be because he was less than convinced himself. I appreciate that he is constrained in the opinions that he is allowed to express, but I suspect that were he free to express his opinions, he might say something very different and agree with his own local authority, Dumfries and Galloway regional council, which has made clear to members of the Committee about water and sewerage that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this service should remain publicly accountable, consist of Elected Members and be based on natural catchment areas and watersheds."</p></blockquote>
That is the opinion of Dumfries and Galloway regional council, which should know, because its job is to provide the quality service to the Minister's constituents that the Minister is threatening to disrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are well served at present by Lothian regional council's water and sewerage department. The system works well. There is fair pricing, to respond to the point of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. The charges to my constituents for their water and sewerage services are significantly below the Scottish average and a long way below the charges to consumers in the privatised English system. The current system in Lothian is accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me cite an example. An immediate problem is the urgent need to stop discharging untreated or semi-treated sewage into the Firth of Forth, not just because of European regulations, but because that is what people want. Huge investment has gone into intercepting sewage discharges and taking them to sewage treatment works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. May I ask the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home

	<span class='label label-info column'>1583</span>
Robertson) to talk a little more quietly so that the hon Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) can be heard by his colleagues around him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, strangely enough, everything is reasonably quiet. There are occasions when what the hon. Gentleman says has a bearing, especially on 	<i>Hansard.</i> Hon. Members who want to engage in prolonged conversation should go out into the Corridor: they certainly should not engage in loud conversation. However, I can hear the hon. Member for East Lothian at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am talking about untreated sewage, which is what the hon. Member for Ayr talks all the time, he should be able to follow what I am saying. There is an urgent need to take action to get that material treated and to stop discharging it at sea, as is the current practice of Lothian regional council. There was a major public consultation exercise about how to handle the material. A proposal has been made to incinerate most of the sewage from the city of Edinburgh and the surrounding area at Seafield in Edinburgh. The proposal is controversial and expensive. Last year, a major consultation exercise explained what was involved physically and in terms of cost. People now understand the proposal and it is abundantly clear that Lothian regional council is up to the job, which it proposes to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be best if the existing regional councils, which are demonstrably doing a first-class job, were allowed to carry on doing that job. I agree with my hon. Friends that the next best way to approach the task—it is our fall-back position—would be through joint boards. They could maintain the current efficient structure and would, crucially, keep the accountability that is achieved through democratically elected councillors working side by side with professionals who understand the engineering aspect of managing water services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted the case for joint boards for police and fire services, the Strathclyde passenger transport authority and a range of other services. Therefore, it would be within the scope of the Bill for the Government to accept a similar joint approach for the management of water and sewerage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has insisted that the Government will go ahead with the three massive super quangos, which will cover wide areas with only 11 members, all of whom will be appointed. Therefore, we shall lose all vestiges of public accountability. The massive scale of the quangos will make life far more difficult for many of our constituents. In my area, the new East water board will cover a colossal area from the Tweed in the south to the Tay and Loch Lomond. In that area, just 11 people, all nominated by the Government, will manage these vital services. The board will be unaccountable, and that is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals have been universally rejected by the Scottish people. We have gone one stage beyond the blocking minority that was discussed with such enthusiasm in the House today. Scotland now has a ruling minority of just 11 Tory Members of Parliament who represent only 13 per cent. in the opinion polls. On this issue, just 2.8 per cent. is the ruling minority, given the verdict of the people in the referendum held in Strathclyde last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1584</span>
Consultation on the proposals has been nothing short of a farce. The Government held a nominal consultation exercise, in which they received the response that the people did not want privatisation or "quangoisation". At first, the Government were not prepared to heed that, but Strathclyde regional council held its referendum last week and we know the result. It was overwhelming, and the Government cannot simply brush that aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government and Conservative Members are not prepared to listen to the people of Strathclyde, perhaps they will take account of the fact that 97 per cent. of people voted against their proposals and will listen to the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). Such offensive legislation shows total contempt for public opinion in Scotland, and can be interpreted only as a direct challenge to the people of Scotland to opt out of the United Kingdom. That is dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should consider carefully the implications of its decisions on the amendments and the clause. We should make it our business to defend the principle of democractic control over one of Scotland's most vital public services. I wish that Conservative Members would deal with the issue seriously because they could terribly damage not only the Scottish water industry, but the credibility of parliamentary government and the democratic system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We keep coming back to the enormous influence of the five English members of the Committee. We are surrounded by portraits of another five Members of Parliament who in 1642 had to take considerable risks and practically put their heads on the line to defend the rights of Parliament. The five English Members should address the matter with the seriousness that it deserves.

The words of the hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) at our second sitting were quite wise. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am here as an Englishman and as an English Unionist. It is important that we should think of the Union when we consider the issues. Many of the issues that we shall discuss have an impact on the Union as a whole. The Union is as important to my constituents as it is to Scotland. It is a vital dynamic in our economic life and for our common wealth.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The essence of the Union is good government. That is clear in Northern Ireland where there is much concern about the democratic deficit, which has had deleterious effect on the strength of the Union.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I take the words of the hon. Member for Hamilton that English Conservative Members should consider carefully the arguments of the Opposition very much to heart. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall do that. I believe in our common Union and the Bill is important for that. It is about good government. I am concerned to ensure that the Bill provides precisely that."—(	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 3 February 1994; 	<i>c.</i>27–28.)</p></blockquote>
Ever since then, at every division he has done what he has been told to do by his Whip and voted along with the other Tories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached the most controversial stand part debate in relation to the future structure of the water industry in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman knows what people in Strathclyde and the rest of Scotland feel about that. They are desperately anxious to retain democratic control of their water industry. They expressed that clearly in the referendum. At the end of the debate the hon. Member for Blackpool, North will be able to vote on whether we should retain democratically accountable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1585</span>
structures for the water industry or whether it is to be passed to a totally unaccountable super quango.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How often has the hon. Gentleman defied his party Whip in the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never felt remotely inclined to do so. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) feels that Scotland should have accountable government and that this Parliament should be seen to respond to the aspirations of the people in Scotland. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North said in a clearly considered and constructive speech that he wanted to take account of such matters. He was alive to his responsibility as a member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Scotland are looking to the Committee to take the issue seriously and to ensure that this vital industry is kept under accountable, democratic control. We all accept that it will have to be restructured to achieve access to other sources of finance, but that can still be done while maintaining accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision on stand part and the amendments will be the crunch issue for many people in Scotland. Conservative Members should be aware of how their vote on the amendments will be interpreted. If we get it right and provide for democratic accountability, that will reinforce public confidence in the way Parliament operates. If it is another 12:11 vote, I fear that what the hon. Member for Angus, East said will be right and it will be yet another example of Parliament failing in its duty to scrutinise Scottish legislation properly. That will be a disaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning in Committee I was very angry. I was particularly angered by the arrogance of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries who is not normally noted for his arrogance. On previous occasions in this Committee, he has dealt with amendments fairly, by giving way to interventions and by taking points reasonably. I can only assume that he was set on a course by his Secretary of State and his Government, about which he had some reservations. He felt that if he deviated from that course, some of his true feelings might come out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little less angry this afternoon, having sat through the Prime Minister being savaged by his own side—savaged by silence almost as much as by the interventions. I face the Committee with somewhat mixed feelings because I know now that the Government are on a slippery slope towards their end. What worries me is the damage that the Government can do before that end finally comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's perspective which was confirmed for me earlier this afternoon when I saw the President of the Board of Trade in the Tea Room, lobbying support among Back-Bench Tory Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I return to the long list of amendments and the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, when the Minister said that "change is essentiar, several Opposition Members asked why. All that we wanted was a reasoned argument about why the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1586</span>
proposals and change itself were essential. All that we got from the hon. Member for Dumfries were the words, "Because I am telling you." That will go down as this Government's epitaph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quotes me out of context. At the beginning of my speech, I said that change was necessary because a number of the water authorities will disappear. The hon. Member for East Lothian asked me why the island councils could not also be water authorities and I explained why that was not possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary for all the authorities to disappear. None of the changes proposed by the Government are necessary. As we said earlier in the Committee, the proposed changes are boundary driven. They are driven by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). They are driven by the fanaticism and dogma of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is absolutely right. He used the words this morning to which I have referred in reply to a specific question. However, those words epitomise the Government's attitude to the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian has just said, they are pushing through the Bill by 12 votes to 11 day after day, week after week. We know that they do not have to make their arguments because they have their Lobby fodder. There are no Conservative Members who think independently. Nobody has the guts, the independent thinking, the intellectual capacity or the courage to stand up against the Government, like the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) did earlier in the Chamber when he challenged the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are Conservative Members who know that what they are doing is wrong: they know how the Bill will be harmful, yet they go along meekly. The Bill is a testimony to that. They go along because the Minister is telling them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an important point and reinforcing what I said earlier. The hon. Member for Stroud challenged me by asking whether I had ever voted against my party. I should have responded to that question then. I have been here long enough to have been a Government Back Bencher. The first Standing Committee of which I was a member considered a Transport Bill and I voted against the Government on an issue concerning marine pollution. Responsible Back Benchers—including Government Back Benchers—should not vote for rubbish legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I knew that, given time, he would remember his rebellions. There have been other occasions. I remember one, but I shall not remind him of it. I know that he is an independent thinker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Astonishingly, the Minister said that the changes would give consumers direct access to the Secretary of State. At the moment, they have direct access to the people who run the water sewerage services. They can see their councillors in their communities every day of every week.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1587</span>
They are accessible to the consumers, and very often receive strong and eloquently expressed views from consumers. However, what does direct access to the Secretary of State mean? Many hon. Members in this Committee, including some Conservative Members, to whom I am grateful, met the Strathclyde Elderly Forum the other day. The Opposition Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) met the delegation and acknowledged its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the delegation came to London, it sent a letter to the Secretary of State asking to see him. He said, "I am too busy to see you." The Secretary of State was too busy, even though he has all Tuesday and all Thursday free because he no longer serves on this Committee. That is an example of direct access to the Secretary of State. However, I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). He agreed to see the delegation at a moment's notice and without hesitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that nominations will be made by the Secretary of State and that, if we are lucky, one or two councillors will be favoured. Who will they be? My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton says that it certainly will not be Ian Hutchison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You can bank on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that we can bank on that: that should be put on the record. Pool old Ian Hutchison; but I do not think that our old friend Colonel Saunders, of chicken fame, will be chosen either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One cannot possibly fault the hon. Member for Eastwood. At the weekend Ian Hutchison, leader of Eastwood district council, was quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shouldn't say it to the press, but the man's guilty of sheer political incompetence."</p></blockquote>
The Provost of Bearsden was also quoted as saying that the Minister is "stupid" and "insulting". Will there be any Conservative councillors left to be appointed to the quangos?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering. I suppose that there are Brian Meek, and Murray Tosh in Kyle and Carrick. Perhaps there will be even fewer after this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know that that former Conservative leader, the very same Colonel Frank Saunders, has decided to stand as an independent candidate on the basis that he opposes the Government's local government proposals? He is likely to be elected on that ticket, as would anyone after the fiasco of the past seven weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is another one who will not be on the list. A few councillors may be chosen, but only by the grace and favour of the Secretary of State. Our experience of that is unequivocal; people chosen by the Secretary of State as his appointees do his bidding. That is the purpose of quangos. I am not happy about joint boards. The Minister earlier seemed to think that we were enthusiastic about joint boards. We want directly elected authorities but, if we do not get them, the second best option is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1588</span>
have joint boards with members from the directly elected authority. Those members will have their own mandate, and they will be nominated by their authorities and not by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the key: such members would be responsible to their authorities. However, the Secretary of State has a number of people whom he can trust—although that number might be diminished after this afternoon. Those people include Deidre Hutton, who will do anything that the Secretary of State asks, John Corrie, who was mentioned earlier, and Aileen Bates. They are all failed Tory candidates who cannot get elected to positions of power. That is why what is happening in all the quangos in Scotland is disgraceful. Those who are incapable of getting elected by the people are put into positions of power by the Government and paid a great deal more than the elected councillors. That is the disgrace. Committee chairmen such as Alex McLean and other people who do a great job as elected councillors receive a pittance compared with the Tory placemen and women who could never get elected in their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a purely party political viewpoint, we might almost be pleased that the Government are ignoring public opinion, as 86 per cent. of Conservatives said that the organisations dealing with water and sewerage services should be left as they are. The Government are ignoring the 65 per cent. who said that public water authorities should be composed of local councillors; they are ignoring those who are worried about increases in cost and they are ignoring those who are worried about disconnection, which until now, has been illegal in Scotland. Once the boards hold power, however, and are faced with arrears, there will be calls for disconnections from the Tories on those boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might almost be glad that the Government are ignoring public opinion in those ways because, in the real test of public opinion in the regional and European elections and, ultimately, in the general election, people will not forget the proposal and the actions of this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister challenged our contention that the proposal is a staging post to privatisation. Three, four or even five times the Minister has shouted loudly and given us an assurance that the Government will not privatise. How does that compare with the assurances given by previous Ministers that value added tax would not be increased when it went up all the same? There were Government assurances before the election that prescription charges would not rise, but they too, went up. I picked two examples, but there are many more. Time and again, Conservative Ministers make promises in the House—on the record—and go back on them. Heaven forbid that there will be another Conservative Government, and that the Minister will retain his post, but even in that event we cannot place any store on his promises. Ministers always say, "Well, circumstances have changed since I gave that pledge." They always find an excuse to renege on their promises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North and I had a civilised exchange, as we should on this Committee. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said, we should debate issues across the Committee, but the Minister was not prepared to have such a debate. The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that the choice was simple: either borrowing was increased or prices went up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton pointed out, prices have to rise in the privatised companies in England, because they cannot borrow. Rather than increase borrowing, the hon. Gentleman said that he would prefer to increase prices to the consumer. He made no bones about that, which was honest of him. I prefer borrowing because it is recovered through taxation which is progressive, whereas increasing prices is regressive taxation: the more that prices go up, the more that cost falls on the poor—on pensioners, disabled people and single-parent families. Those people find it increasingly difficult to pay the higher prices and have to face the spectre of disconnection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a peculiar understanding of economics if he thinks that pricing at today's prices is cheaper than taxation in the future. The plain truth is that it would be much more expensive because all borrowing is deferred taxation. In the interim, one would also be faced with the cost of that borrowing. The compounded effect would be far more crippling than paying today's costs. The hon. Gentleman has obviously never run a business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1590</span>
so I am sure that they will pick up the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second relates to expenditure in Ayrshire. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) is always attacking Strathclyde—we have experienced that all the way through our proceedings. Strathclyde council is Labour-controlled, so he has to find something wrong with it and it does not matter to the hon. Gentleman whether that involves twisting the truth. He said that Ayrshire was badly done by and challenged me on whether I can speak for Ayr. I represent the Kincaidston part of Ayr, but I was talking about the whole of the Ayr division, which contains 14 per cent. of the regional population and accounts for 25 per cent. of the regional council's total capital expenditure on water and sewerage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr wanted to know the starting date for those statistics. The starting date was the reorganisation of local government in 1975. The schemes to clean up the beaches in Ayr division have been completed at Prestwick, Irvine, Troon and Stevenston. Schemes are under way at Ardrossan, Saltcoats, West Kilbride and Girvan, and are at the design stage in Maidens and Ayr, where an application for planning permission has been made for a development at Greenock. The total cost of those schemes has been more than £80 million since 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work is being done by Strathclyde. The director of sewerage for Strathclyde said to me that he could do even more if the Secretary of State were to give capital consent. To say that Ayr division is doing badly is a load of nonsense. That is the sort of nonsense that we hear regularly from Conservative Members, especially the hon. Member for Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the work in Strathclyde region, particularly in Irvine, has been carried out only in the past three or four years? He acknowledged that the work is only now going on in Ardrossan. Does he also acknowledge that the work in Ayr was planned a good 10 years ago and has been put off year after year by Strathclyde regional council? It is essential to meet European standards, but once again the council has produced a scheme in the wrong place and at an additional cost of £6 million. That goes beyond the credibility of many of my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were many arguments there, and the hon. Gentleman was moving from one to the other. The place of the scheme is a matter for discussion. Of the two options—Greenan and Newton—Greenan is the regional council's preferred site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the other scheme, the hon. Gentleman says first that some have been done only recently and that others were planned a long time ago. He cannot have it both ways: that is ludicrous. Some time ago, when this was a major issue, I spoke to the director of sewerage for Strathclyde. These guys like to build big sewerage works—they like being up to their oxters in shit, if you will excuse that phrase, Sir James. That is what those guys are in local government for, although I cannot understand it myself. They would love to build more sewerage works, but they must have regard to the ceiling of the Secretary of State's capital consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1591</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has said enough. A great deal has been undertaken and Ayr division has done very well out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the overwhelming result of the Strathclyde referendum, I should have thought that there would be some movement by the Government. Surely a Government with any sense, or any instinct for survival, would have realised that it was time to take account of public opinion. Things will be dreadful over the next few months—perhaps the next one or two years—while the Government continue in power. Their continued intransigence over the referendum will ensure that when the time comes, support for them will not simply go down, it will go down by a huge amount, and rightly so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened closely to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). I said earlier today—after all, I believe that a Member is entitled to speak twice in a Committee—that Opposition Members say repeatedly that all the problems associated with water and sewerage arise from lack of investment, which is not the fault of the local authorities. Opposition Members claim that responsibility should lie with the authorities, but that instead it lies with the Secretary of State who is always clamping down on the amount of money that they can spend. That is about to change, and I welcome it. The hon. Gentleman made part of our case for us in his most recent contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to the question that I asked before lunch. The Minister has criticised COSLA's estimate of £2 per annum as the increase in domestic water charges. I ask him yet again to give an indication of how much the charges will increase under his proposed new authorities to fund the extra £5 billion of capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his consultation paper on the review of the water and sewerage services in Scotland, the Secretary of State originally invited views for the future arrangements of the service. He linked that review to the consultation excercise taking place on the local government structure in Scotland. A major consideration set out in the consultation document is that there will be a requirement for capital investment in the water and sewerage services of about £5 billion over a 15-year period for new works to improve the quality of both water and sewerage services, maintain the existing infrastructure and to provide services for new developments. Under the current funding arrangements, this will have to be met from the Secretary of State's block allocation for Scotland, and will count against the public sector borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper devoted a significant proportion of its limited consideration to possible options for change among privatisation options. However, no doubt because of overwhelming opposition to the options, the Government have taken the fallback option of creating independent water authorities. The difficulty facing the Government because of that decision is that those boards will still be within the public sector, as currently defined, and the problem posed by the capital investment of £5 billion because of its impact on the Secretary of State's budget, and the PSBR, remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1592</span>
There is a mammoth problem for the PSBR. The Government's solution appears to be the private finance initiative. That would involve the private sector building, owning, and operating capital assets, with water authorities paying continuing charges on the basis of services provided. The great benefit, from the Government's view, is that as the assets are owned by the private sector, the capital expenditure does not count as public expenditure, and has no impact on the PSBR.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the private finance initiative does not, however, depend on the creation of independent water authorities. The facility is equally available to local authorities. The Scottish Office has already issued a circular to local authorities encouraging them to consider using it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may consider that he will be in a much stronger position with independent authorities to encourage them to make use of the private finance initiative. But some regional authorities are examining in detail the potential use of the facility to enable them to initiate essential projects that cannot be met from current capital consent levels, on account of which the Government face genuine difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's financial memorandum suggests that the introduction of private finance for the new infrastructure will provide efficiency savings, but this has yet to be proved. It remains to be seen whether the private sector will be willing to invest in water and sewerage services at the level required, and what price they may demand to encourage that investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the private finance initiative does not meet required investment levels, the fallback position could be to fund capital expenditure directly from current revenue. Limited funding now takes place, but a significant increase would quickly lead to substantially increased charges for consumers. The facility has been available to local authorities only since 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That's it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus, East says "That's it." These are difficult and serious problems for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new water authorities in England, which are free from public expenditure constraints, appear to have generally ignored the use of new equity or debt to finance capital investment, but have financed largely directly from revenue. That has resulted in excessive increases in water and sewerage charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another solution to the funding problem lies in the Government's hands. They could consider changing the Treasury rules which define public expenditure and the forms of borrowing that count against the public sector borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A water company in England and a water authority in Scotland can both borrow to fund capital expenditure. The borrowing can be from the same source in each case, and in each case the service is almost totally paid for by the consumers of the services. However, under the Treasury rules the borrowing by an English company is ignored but a Scottish authority's expenditure is counted as public expenditure and is subject to strict control by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent consultative paper prepared for my party's finance and industry group symposium on public and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1593</span>
private finance considered the definition of the PSBR. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK national accounts treat the public sector as an integrated whole. Money raised on the capital markets by state owned industries is consolidated with borrowing by central and local government to produce the public sector borrowing requirement. The PSBR is a creation of the Treasury's—the concept is not used at all in France or in the United States, for instance—and it is what the Treasury say it is."</p></blockquote>
That was the view of this serious symposium. It found that the convention among our European partners is to distinguish the public sector's market-related activities from core Government functions. It was also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main exclusion from public expenditure is the expenditure of those government owned enterprises or public corporations which primarily sell the goods and services that they produce in the market. In UK terms, that means distinguishing between, on the one hand, the activities of public corporations plus government trading bodies and, on the other hand, the principal activities of government, which involve taxing to finance public services."</p></blockquote>
It is worth asking why Britain continues with its rules as currently defined. It would seem that by bringing our rules into line with those in Europe and removing trading services, including Scotland's water and sewerage services, the PSBR could be reduced at a stroke. It is not that the Treasury rules cannot be changed; the Government have made much of the fact that they changed the rules recently to facilitate the private finance initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggested change in the rules would provide the solution to the funding problem facing the water and sewerage services in Scotland and avoid the need to remove them from local authority control. Many of us, of all parties, are passionately against removing them from such control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent COSLA paper showed that if local authorities were allowed to borrow up to the level required to meet the £5 billion investment that will be needed over the next 15 years, it could be financed by an annual increase in charges of about 2 per cent. However, questions have been asked about local authorities' past performance in dealing with water and sewerage services. They are clearly answered by the Secretary of State in his consultation paper, which stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"over the years local authorities, of various sizes and configurations, have shown that they can effectively deliver water and sewerage services."</p></blockquote>
It also stated that by retaining the services in local authority control,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consumer interests would have a voice through ultimate responsibility for the services being vested in elected representatives."</p></blockquote>
Expenditure on infrastructure in Scotland has consistently exceeded the basic consent levels issued by the Secretary of State. Lothian region tells me that by the use of capital receipts it has spent almost £6 million more than its consent levels in the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite Lothian region's record of consistently achieving the basic consent level of expenditure, the total investment since the formation of the region has been inadequate, entirely owing to the Government's restrictions on borrowing. An illustration of the inadequate investment lies in the fact that on Lothian region's formation in 1975 it inherited two major projects—the Megget reservoir scheme and the city of Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme. Both schemes were
	<span class='label label-info column'>1594</span>
enormously important to our region. Following the drought and water shortages of 1974 the Megget scheme was urgently required to augment the region's water supply and to provide for requirements into the next century. At the time, Edinburgh sewage was discharged after only simple screening treatment directly into the Forth estuary. The Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme was introduced to remove the pollution from that major population site. The substantial cost of those schemes—Megget cost £47 million and the Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme £63 million—became an immediate burden on the Lothian region capital expenditure programme and dominated it for the next 10 years, until the Megget scheme was completed in 1985. In effect, that scheme accounted for a considerable proportion of the capital budget over 1984–85; it delayed the progress of the Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme and prevented progress on the infrastructure necessary to meet the region's needs. Work on the Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme is still in progress and the programme is due for completion in 1996–97. Under the new arrangements is there a guarantee that work on the scheme will stick to that timetable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 10 years, as progress on the Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme has continued, the backlog of other projects and schemes has been substantially increased by the requirements of legislation such as the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990, the bathing water directive and the urban waste water treatment directive. Lothian region has, consequently, a statutory duty to complete a considerable number of projects in a time scale dictated by statute. How can the Minister guarantee that what is, after all, a statutory obligation, will be implemented under the new arrangements? Capital plans have been prepared to meet the requirements, but progress on them is severely limited by the expenditure limitations imposed by the Scottish Office through control of the section 94 borrowing consent. Lothian region has, historically, successfully brought about progress in the required water and drainage work to the full limits on capital expenditure imposed by the Scottish Office. Records for the past 10 years show that the Lothian region has consistently spent, or overspent, the capital expenditure consent. The main reason for its not yet having completed the Edinburgh sewage disposal scheme, SDS, and for its current struggle to comply with current legislative requirements is not lack of commitment, effort or ability but the financial constraints imposed by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Edinburgh SDS started in 1970 and it was to be complete by 1975. An additional year, taking the date to May 1976, was approved. By May 1978 some sections of the interceptor were in place and the treatment works was commissioned, but since that year the average expenditure on Edinburgh SDS has continued at approximately £1.7 million a year. It is not scheduled for completion until 1996–97. Therefore, it will be 10 years overdue.

Schemes for treating the crude sewage discharge from South Queensferry, Tranent, Musselburgh, Dunbar and North Berwick have all been deferred. I five near Queensferry and I know how urgent such a scheme is. I suggest that that Minister, the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1595</span>
Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who lives in the North Berwick and Dunbar area becomes aware of its problems. Similarly, inland works were starved of the necessary infrastructure and, as a result, development problems now exist in West Lothian and Midlothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: East Lothian, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and in East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Treatment works for Bathgate, Seafield, Blackburn, Whitburn, East Calder and Ormiston were scheduled for commencement in 1988–89, but they were all delayed. Because of the spend on Megget reservoir, refurbishment of works to the value of £9 million at Alnwickhill, Pateshill, Fairmilehead, Castle Moffat, Rosebery and Rosebery phase II were also deferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth quoting a letter from the Prime Minister to the president of COSLA. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The local authorities in Scotland for many years provided highly effective water and sewerage services which the public rightly appreciate. The case for change is not that the local authorities have fallen down on the job but that a different structure is now needed if a very large investment programme is to be achieved over the next 10–15 years without further increasing public expenditure and putting pressure on the public sector borrowing requirement".</p></blockquote>
If the Treasury rules could be changed as suggested, there would be no need for a different structure and the service could be left in the capable hands of the local authorities to continue to provide a highly effective service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be obvious to the Committee that I have gone into the issues in great detail with Lothian regional council. I have talked to the council and, over the years, I have been taken round some of the works and, chiefly, those in West Lothian. I am not a professional water engineer, but I am greatly impressed by what the council has done. I hope that I am not being too carping because it is easy to take advantage of people if they have not made certain visits and I have not visited many important areas. However, as when I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central, I have a question for Ministers. Have they been round Strathclyde or Lothian and seen their sophisticated operations? The answer may be yes. I hope to God that it is yes, because politicians and Ministers should not tamper with highly sophisticated operations unless they know exactly what they are doing. To know that, Ministers should, at least, have paid those operations the courtesy of a sustained visit. Has that taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the heart of the debate is the question of trust and whether the Committee and the people of Scotland can believe the Government. I have listened to the debate for most of the day and the spectacle of the hon. Members for Tayside, North, for Ayr and for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) saying, "Cross our hearts and hope to die. Honest to God, we believe in public ownership" has been anything but convincing. It has not been credible. It has been just as incredible as my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) applying to join the Scottish National party. Nobody would believe that and no one thinks that Conservative members of the Committee believe in public ownership and are serious about keeping water and severage services under public ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish the hon. Gentleman to be under any illusion about me. I want to get as much
	<span class='label label-info column'>1596</span>
out of public ownership and into private ownership as possible. My views have never changed on that. If the hon. Gentleman wants to quote me, he should do so accurately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not only quote the hon. Gentleman, but I shall be watching to see how he votes at the end of the debate. If he votes in favour of public ownership I shall point that out to his constituents back in Tayside, North. It may even impress some Labour voters in that area. It will impress his own supporters: even Tory voters believe in keeping the water and sewerage industry under public control. It is only hon. Members like the hon. Member for Tayside, North who do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate are trying to convince the Scottish people that they seriously want to keep water and sewerage in public ownership, even after they have privatised it in England and Wales. That is just not credible. They are like little boys who are caught with their hands in the till and who claim that they are only counting the money to make sure that it is all there. Would they, they ask, privatise the water industry in Scotland? It has, we are to believe, never entered their head to do so even after they all voted for it in England and Wales. Some members of the Committee represent English constituencies where the water and sewerage industries are under private control. They supported that. In Committee, however, they appear to say that they will do something entirely different in Scotland. The arguments that we have heard from Tory Members today are just not credible. If the Minister wants people to believe what he is saying he must come up with some good arguments. He cannot simply tell people that something is so because he tells them that it is so. That was the only argument he used this morning to defend his position. It is a disgraceful, undemocratic argument which should not be heard from the lips of any Minister who claims to be part of a democratic Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to argue that privatisation was a myth and was not on the agenda in Scotland. I have a research paper produced by the House of Commons Library. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will accept that the Library staff take an objective view of such matters. They look at matters dispassionately and tell the truth as they see it. Referring to the reorganisation of water and sewerage, that paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In several respects the reorganisation provided for in this Bill parallels changes in England and Wales following local government reorganisation in 1973.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Orders made under the Local Government Act 1972 and the Water Act 1973 transferred the water and sewerage assets from local authorities to ten new water authorities."</p></blockquote>
It sounds familiar does it not. It is exactly what is happening here today. The Government are transferring the assets of the water and sewerage assets from locally elected councils in Scotland to three new water authorities, just like they did in England and Wales. The paper continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, unlike the proposals contained in this Bill, a majority of the members of a water authority were appointed by the local authorities in its area, with the remainder (including the chairman) being appointed by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
We have not reached that stage yet but it may be the kind of compromise that we will hear about over the Easter recess when the Minister comes forward and tries to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1597</span>
retrieve something from the shambles of the Government's present position. A compromise along the lines the Government tried in England many years ago may be proposed in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The boards of these water authorities were restructured in 1983 by the Water Act 1983 which removed local authority representation from the water boards, reducing them to having 9–15 members all of which were nominated by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is what they are proposing to do to us now. There will be water authorities separated from the local authorities with appointees of the Secretary of State. Shortly after doing that in 1989 in England and Wales, the Government took the next step to privatise the water authorities and take them completely out of the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not do it in one bite in England and Wales and they will not do it in one bite here in Scotland either. They will take it in stages. This is the first stage of a long march towards privatisation. It is not only Opposition Members who understand that. The Scottish people understand that too. The people who live in Eastwood and Ayr who send petitions know what the Tories are up to. They know about the proposals in the Bill. They know that the Bill may not mean privatisation today but it will certainly mean privatisation tomorrow—if the Government ever got back into power in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments that have been used by the Minister and other Tory Members to show that they have no plans to privatise are totally unconvincing The Minister can give all the commitments he wants. He will not be the Minister five years from now. If there is a Tory Government then, someone else will be in charge of Scottish water and that other Minister will be responsible for the steps leading to privatisation. The assurances that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow gets from the Under-Secretary about his intention to not privatise water are worthless. The Under-Secretary will not be here when privatisation happens. Some other Minister, in a future Tory Government, will put in the boot and deliver privatisation. I see that the hon. Members representing English constituencies are nodding in agreement. That is why the Minister says that he can assure us that the Government will never privatise water. I want his fellow Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, to assure us that he will never support the privatisation of water in Scotland because he may be around in a future Tory Government—although, following the results of the Strathclyde referendum, he probably will not be. The assurances given are worth nothing because everybody knows exactly what the Government are up to and what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we should not worry because the boards will be democratically accountable to Parliament through the Secretary of State. Will he reflect on that statement? Let us consider what is happening in this Room today. Is it democratic? Do Conservative members genuinely believe that what we are doing is democratic? Is it democratic for the Minister to ignore 97 per cent. of the people who rejected the Government's proposals in a referendum? Is it democratic for the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, to ignore 95 per cent. of his constituents, who tell him that they do not want the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1598</span>
proposals? The same applies to the hon. Member for Ayr. What is democratic about hon. Members ignoring the views of their constituents, who would be affected by the proposals, and then ramming those proposals down their throats?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is democratic about five hon. Members representing English constituencies on the Committee? They do not speak or contribute to the debate but, by their votes, they decide what will happen to people in another country when their constituents are not affected by the proposals. Keir Hardie had a marvellous expression about dumb dogs which sit but dare not bark. He was referring to Lib-Lab Members of Parliament who would not stand up for working class issues in the early 1900s, but he might have been referring to the five English Members in this Committee had he been around to see them here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I attend the Committee and Parliament week in and week out because I was elected in Dundee, East. I was elected, however, on a mandate to get rid of this system, to reform it out of existence and to ensure that I could not vote on issues that affect people living in England only. That is my position. The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) defends a system in which hon. Members can interfere in the affairs of another country, without having democratic representative rights in that country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a united country in the way that Conservative Members think that it is. Scotland is a distinct nation. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a multi-national entity. Scotland has its own distinct traditions, its own system of local government and its own way of operating. Hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies should decide what happens in those circumstances, not hon. Members representing other parts of the United Kingdom. If there were a proper federal system, there would be a more democratic, more accountable and more realistic Government for the people who live in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that people in Scotland will be allowed to put forward names for consideration by the Secretary of State for inclusion in the new water authorities. Has he any idea how insulting that sounds to people living in Scotland? The water and sewerage industry is under democratic control at the moment. The people decide who runs the services in Scotland, yet the Minister is now saying that they can go on their knees before the Secretary of State and ask, "Can we get this person on the authority to control the water and sewerage industry?" I prefer the system in which the people elect who runs the industry to that put forward by the Minister.

It is maintained that there would be direct access to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The "Speaking Out" programme on radio, which goes out tomorrow morning, has pulled off a great feat: it has managed to persuade the

Secretary of State to take part. The people of Scotland will have a chance, for an hour, to speak to him directly on the telephone and ask him questions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Last year, before I took on this job, the Secretary of State published a document called "Scotland and the Union". The centre-piece behind the Government's claim that they would become more accessible to the people of Scotland was a revamped Scottish Grand Committee. After much discussion behind the scenes, agreement was reached, quite remarkably, between all parties about the technical reform and improvement of the House's performance. Since then we have heard nothing. The Secretary of State has said in a newspaper interview that the Government would wait until the Labour party started behaving in the House of Commons. That reform was to be the centre-piece of the Government's way of locking Scotland into the Union. As Lesley Riddich discovered, trying to get the Secretary of State or any Minister to appear on a radio programme causes them to run away. Ministers avoid any cross-examination by the people about the affairs of state. The real reason for the Government's delay in reorganising the Scottish Grand Committee is their cowardice. It is nothing to do with Labour's handling of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as always, makes a valid point and one that was totally in order, Sir James, as I could tell from the way in which you were gesticulating at me.

The arrogance displayed by the Secretary of State when he said that he would reform the Scottish Grand Committee when Labour behaves is the same as that which he displayed to the voters in Strathclyde. They made it clear that they did not want the proposals to go ahead, but the Secretary of State said that the voters must be stupid.

I did not have the privilege of being present in Eastwood on Saturday morning, when some of my hon. Friends spoke to the Minister's constituents at the Newton Mearns shopping centre. One of my hon.

She wanted to know how anyone could call her stupid. She admitted to acting in a stupid manner once—when she voted for the hon. Member for Eastwood at the previous election. That is a mistake that she will not repeat, and neither will thousands of other erstwhile Tory supporters. The reason is the arrogance of Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the arguments of Conservative Members were consistent. The Minister said that it was necessary to have three water boards, with appointments made by the Secretary of State for Scotland, because that would ensure that increases in water charges would be smaller. He said that charges for water in Scotland had increased by more than 100 per cent. in the past five years, and that charges for sewerage services had increased by more than 50 per cent. He said that those costs compared poorly with England and Wales, where increases under the privatised companies had been far less steep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South argued for what he quaintly described as the "most cheapest" costs. I am not sure what that means, but at least his argument was consistent with the Minister's. Then the hon. Member for Tayside, North chimed in, arguing the opposite. In his view, the Secretary of State for Scotland had to appoint members to the boards because they would have to make unpopular decisions about charges. He argued that as they were likely to rise steeply, elected councillors could not be trusted to make such a decision because they had to listen to the electorate. If the electorate do not want high charges, councillors will not vote for high charges. That was the gist of the hon. Gentleman's argument, and that is the reality behind the amendments. The Government are not prepared to leave the decision to elected councillors. The people appointed by the Secretary of State to sit on the water boards created by the Government are prepared to make the unpopular decision of greatly increasing water charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On last Thursday's Order Paper, early-day motion 911, which was tabled by hon. Members who represent Wales and who know what has happened in England and Wales, shows that the average cost of water and sewerage services in Wales is £233 per household. That compares very unfavourably with the average cost in Scotland which, under the public sector, is £116 per household. That is what upsets Conservative Members. They think that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1601</span>
people in Scotland do not pay enough for their water and sewerage services. They want to increase that amount hugely, but that cannot be done as long as water and sewerage services in Scotland remain under democratic control. The Government do not have the support in Scotland to ensure that their people are elected to run the water and sewerage industry. Taking responsibility for water and sewerage services away from the elected authorities and giving it to the new quango structure will enable them to increase the charges very substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North, who has, as usual, not shown any respect to the Committee by not being present after making a contribution, argued at one point that the structure proposed by the Minister was necessary because it would mean that spending on water and sewerage would be brought directly under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The hon. Gentleman implied that at present, it was under the control not of the right hon. Gentleman, but of the elected local authorities. However, that is not the case. The document entitled "Serving Scotland's Needs", about the Scottish Office's spending plans, points out that there is a statutory allocation of capital consent, that the Secretary of State has a statutory right to decide how much local authorities can borrow and, in respect of water and sewerage services, that there is no freedom for local authorities to vire that spending between different budget heads; they must spend all the money that they are allowed to borrow on water and sewerage services. The Secretary of State for Scotland already controls how much money is spent on water and sewerage services in Scotland. To argue that the boards are needed to allow him to control it is totally unconvincing; he already controls it. That is not the issue at stake here, so I doubt whether anyone will be persuaded by that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister agreed with one COSLA argument about what the likely additional spending would have to be in the next 10 to 15 years; he confirmed that in his view, it would be about £100 million a year, in addition to what is already planned to be spent on water and sewerage services in Scotland. He even agreed that in the first year, it would cost only about £2 per head in Strathclyde, for example, or in any local authority area to raise that additional £100 million, as COSLA argued. But he said that that was as far as he was prepared to go along with the COSLA argument. Thereafter, the costs would increase year on year, the costs of borrowing would become more and more expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a certain extent, I am prepared to accept that. But to change how water boards are controlled does not change matters. If those circumstances apply to locally elected authorities, they will apply equally to the new water boards that will be controlled by the appointees of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Quangos might run the water industry, but that will not change the reality of what must be done about borrowing money to invest in the water and sewerage industry. Whether it is run by locally elected councils or by a quango, money could be raised through the public works loan board. The Minister helpfully made it clear that the new water authorities could raise some money through that board. Locally elected authorities and the new quangos could also raise money in the private markets. There is no difference between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1602</span>
Therefore, what is the difference? Why are quangos, rather than locally elected councils, necessary to fund the investment that will be required? Both will have exactly the same powers to raise money. The hon. Member for Tayside, North again came close to describing why that is necessary. Locally elected councils would borrow the money that is required for investment in water and sewerage services; they would pay it back over a number of years and would try to keep the borrowing costs at a minimum. However, the new quangos would fund a significant part of the capital spending directly out of revenue. They could do so by raising water charges in Scotland by an enormous amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the essence of the argument. The Government want to make the people pay for the investment in water and sewerage—and to pay now—by doubling and perhaps even trebling the charges for water. The Government know that they cannot achieve that while water and sewerage services remain under democratic control. Therefore, they are taking those services out of democratic control so that they have the power to impose massive hikes in water charges on the people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether the process stops there; it would give assistance only in the short term. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been trying to grapple with the huge public sector borrowing requirement of nearly £50 billion. He has argued that he aims, by 1996–97, I believe, to wipe out completely the PSBR in the United Kingdom, so that the Government will not owe anyone anything in three to four years' time. How can the Government do that when the public sector continually borrows and adds to the PSBR? I believe that the Government's view is that in the longer term, the water and sewerage industry will be privatised; they will sell it off. Do Conservative Members believe that that will in any way contribute to solving the problems of funding investment in the water and sewerage industry, which will be required in the next 10 to 15 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the Government's spending plans. I believe that taking this year and the next three years together—up to the year 1996–97—the Government intend to spend just over £1 billion on the water and sewerage industry in Scotland. Let us examine the statistics for the privatised system in England and Wales. In the past three years, the private water companies in England and Wales have taken out in profits from the water and sewerage industry £3.686 billion—that is, taken out in profits before taxation. How can a privatised water company that takes money out of the industry contribute to the costs required to fund the industry over the next 10 to 15 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Government's long-term solution, which is privatisation of the water industry, will make it more difficult to secure the investment that will be required for the water and sewerage industry over that period. The privatised water companies have one priority only—to secure profits for themselves and for their shareholders. They can get those profits only by taking money out of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So long as the water and sewerage companies are in the public sector, we can ensure that the money gets ploughed back into the industry and that nobody gets rich pickings from the water and sewerage industry in Scotland. People get emotive about water and sewerage. At the weekend, a newspaper reporter tried to play the issue down. It was Brian Meek, who has experience of local government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1603</span>
in Scotland. He wrote that he remembered that nobody wanted to serve on the water and sewerage committees because they were dull, with no big, political debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long as the water and sewerage committees in regional councils remain in the public sector and under local, democratic control, the meetings will never be very exciting. I have served on them myself and they are fairly mundane, technical and detailed. Nobody gets upset, there are never any divisions and there are no political arguments backwards and forwards. The political arguments emerge when the Government try to take the water and sewerage industries out of democratic control. That is when people start to get passionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an extract from the Government's consultation document. In chapter 1, on the first page, its states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"General legislation on public water supplies first appeared on the statute book in 1833".</p></blockquote>
I happen to have an extract from the Dundee source book of history from 1833, which gives the causes of death occurring in Dundee in 1833. Some 137 people died from cholera, 15 died from dysentry and 132 died from typhoid and fever. People were dying in their hundreds and thousands across Scotland because we did not have a publicly controlled water and sewerage industry. Those deaths are now unheard of; nobody dies of typhoid, diarrhoea or cholera in Scotland any longer because the water industry is under public control and there has been legislation about public control in Scotland for the past 100 or more years. People get emotive when Conservative Members suggest that we should move away from the system that has done so much good in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman would listen to the situation in Scotland. It is the Scottish people's right to decide for themselves how and by whom they are governed. If they want the water and sewerage industry under public control, that should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter what smart remarks the hon. Member for Stroud may make about the situation in France or other European countries, the reality is that if one fives in a democracy, one listens to what the people say. The people are speaking loud and clear about what they want to happen in the water and sewerage industry. They want it under locally elected, democratic control. Conservative Members are determined not to listen, but to force it out of democratic control into the control of people whom the Scottish voters did not elect. That is the reality. Things will be done to the water and sewerage industry that would not receive popular support in Scotland if they had been tried by anyone who had been elected in Scotland at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian has commented on the threat that the proposal poses to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1604</span>
existing union between Scotland and England. If Conservative Members are unionists and genuinely believe that it is in the interests of both countries to remain inside the Union, they had better start believing that the arrogant way in which they are dealing with the people of Scotland is turning people against any dealings with this particular Union. If being part of the Union means that one cannot even make a decision on how a sewerage system is installed in a particular area or how water is delivered through the tap, people will conclude that they do not want to be part of the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer Conservative Members to the foreword of the White Paper, "Scotland and the Union: A Partnership for Good." It boasts about how good the Union has been for Scotland. However, page 8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With a single act of carelessness, all of that could be lost."</p></blockquote>
I suggest to Conservative Members that a single act of carelessness might lose everything in which they genuinely believe in this Bill. If they believe that they can ignore the democratic voice of the Scottish people on this very important issue and just force through something against the will of the Scottish people, they will pay in the long term for that arrogance. Many people who might agree with them on this side of the border will have to pay the same price. If the price of this Union is that there is no democracy in Scotland, the Union is not worth having.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), whose comments are always accurate and thought-provoking. My children bought me a book for Christmas called "Democracy—The unfinished journey." They will have to write a new chapter for this Government called "The Backward Journey" because of the events that we are witnessing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's contribution was a travesty of the consultation when the document went out. Of those who took the trouble to reply in written submissions, 64 per cent. said that they wanted local authority control, not just no privatisation. That is not what the Government responded to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the principle of joint boards diminishes democracy for Scotland. The Government tell us that democracy must be diminished so that there is a greater ability to finance the capital investment. There have been many good speeches pointing out the lack of democracy in the Government's response, particularly underlining the response of the people of Eastwood. I went to Eastwood at the weekend and people who were lifelong Conservatives told me that they would not vote Conservative again. There may be a democractic response to the issue after all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee agrees that the Scottish water and sewerage system requires £5 billion to be spent on it in the next 15 years. If the Government keep their funding levels of section 94 permissions for water and sewerage at £340 million a year, £3 billion will be available to whichever body or authority is responsible for the task of upgrading water and sewerage as needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In everything that I have read—no one has risen to give me any evidence to the contrary and it was the same when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1605</span>
I studied local government and local government finance at university as part of an economics degree—local authorities are seen as the most reliable funding organisations and the most reliable to which to loan money. They have demonstrably more competitive rates than are available to the private sector in the water industry or anywhere else. They are practically risk free, unlike companies such as Welsh Water, which lost £49 million in one foolish investment in the leisure industry. It wrote off another £50 million in further investments that went bad. That is hardly risk free; therefore, the rates available to such companies are not as good as those available to the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why 40 per cent. of investment in England and Wales at the moment is carried out by borrowing, and 60 per cent. by charging the consumer. That may be honest; the hon. Member for Tayside, North may say that he would commend that because it is telling the brutal truth that the money cannot be borrowed on the terms required and therefore investment must be financed from present revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has explained that in Scotland, a further £2 billion maximum is required to carry out the programme of water and sewerage upgrading. That is £100 million per annum which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, is the equivalent of £2 per year to the consumer. Given the exceedingly low charges in Scotland, no one would object to an extra £2 to guarantee that investment. The Minister said that that sum is only for the first year. If there is a further £2 the next year, and £2 in the year after that, I still do not think that people would be particularly frightened by the prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality in Scotland is that the balance for a local authority at present is 75 per cent. of its investment carried out from capital and 25 per cent. from revenue sources. Those are the Government's own figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the water industry was privatised in England and Wales, it was talked about as a matter of good finance. We heard the word "cheap". The Government even proposed "cheapest". The sum of £5.26 billion was written off in a green dowry, as it was called rather than a blue dowry to the water companies in England and Wales. Taxpayers are still paying for it although it was not carried forward as debt. A further hidden favourable tax treatment is costing taxpayers £7.7 billion, this is to subsidise English and Welsh water companies' investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water and sewerage investment debt of Scottish local authorities is now £1.3 billion. If that were designated a green, blue or red dowry and written off on the basis that it would allow local authorities to finance investment more easily, they could either halve their charges, or make half of what they now charge consumers available for new investment. I do not suggest that the Government are likely to do that. It is merely a good comparator to show that although the Government claim to be about good financing and saving the country money, they appear to be squandering £12 billion in a privatisation venture in England and Wales, while £1.3 billion would bring great benefits in water and sewerage for the Scottish people. I do not advocate writing off debts. I believe that people who enjoy facilities should be willing to pay for them. There is no evidence that people are unwilling to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pertinent question is whether local authorities can finance essential investments without a blue or green
	<span class='label label-info column'>1606</span>
dowry of any kind. Evidence from individual authorities, and from COSLA, shows that they not only can, they do. Their submissions to the Government, which I hope the Minister's officials have read, prove this. They do not require three boards to be better able to finance expenditure. Indeed, three boards would make them less able to do that because only one part of local authority borrowing goes for water and sewerage; the greatest amount is for investment in education, some forms of building, and roads. The £5 billion is therefore part of a very much larger programme. There would be three water boards, investing only in water and sewerage which would mean their borrowing much lower investment funds. They would have less of a chance to invest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point relates to the £2 billion revenue. Local authorities already obtain capital financing from current revenue, in precisely the same way as English water authorities, but they do not have to get 60 per cent. of their financing from that source; they get 25 per cent. to 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet another point relates to operating leases, which are used widely throughout the industry. Local authorities realise that even under the Government's rules, removable plant can be leased rather than bought with capital, although it could be argued that there is much sense in allowing them to buy on favourable investment terms, and charge consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence from Central region, which I hope the Government have studied, shows that capital expenditure from present revenue, or from leasing, does not at this time count against the public sector borrowing requirement. I hope that the Government do not intend to change that because it is financing from revenue and should not be counted against the borrowing requirement. The £2 billion is already being catered for by local authorities, which know of the Government's meanness and unwillingness to extend the PSBR, and have shown that it can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central region offers a specific case. I have read the submission from Strathclyde and my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow outlined Lothian's case with great clarity. The example is being repeated around the country, showing that local authorities are already facing up to the Government's problem of being strapped for cash because they have made a mess of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central region needs to invest about £15 million next year. It will be allowed to borrow £11 million. It now has in place financing from either CFPR—capital from present revenue—or from leases. It has the additional £4 million, and does not need to come back for extra capital borrowing permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest dam in Central region is the Carron dam reservoir. It will cost £18 million to upgrade the reservoir to the standard required for the next 50 or 60 years for the people of central Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commitment of Central region—the financing is in the capital programme—is that, with the use of CFPR and operating leases, this will be developed within the present PSBR within the indicated section 94 capital borrowing permission for that council. That is going on throughout the country.

The projects for Central region could be carried out over the next 15 years and would cause an increase in cost to the consumer of between 40 and 50 per cent., according
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0889">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1607</span>
to the estimate of Central region's stringent finance department. That is 50 per cent. from a base of £49 for a band D house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay £ 120-odd to Thames Water for a flat in the lowest council tax band in a tenement in Southwark—the average charge in Scotland is £49. I pay about £70 in water charges for a seven-apartment, four-bedroomed villa in central Scotland, but twice as much in the Thames Water area of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should realise that people will be willing to pay that 50 per cent. for two reasons. First, they know that the capital programme is laid out in their area for their benefit and, secondly, they can choose or sack a councillor at an election if they think that charges are excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard about the revenue impact this morning. I can show that, capital-wise, it is not a problem for Scottish local authorities; there is no need for three water boards. The Minister said this morning that the charges had increased by 58 per cent. in England and Wales. The English and Welsh figures rated average in the table produced by Strathclyde from the statistics available. The figures for 1992–93 are the latest available and they show that £125 was the average household sewerage bill and £80 was the average sewerage bill for South West Water. The average water bill in England was £80; but just £49 in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the same period, the average water supply bill of Welsh Water was £120; for the English and Welsh companies combined it was £75; for Strathclyde and Scotland it was £55. I do not know where the Minister obtained his figures from. It is much more expensive to obtain water in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that may be that English and Welsh water authorities were starved of capital permission by the Government and had to put more and more charges on to consumers. They were unable to meet their capital commitments, but charged consumers more. They were set up for privatisation; they were financially set up in the way that we are being set up now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the interest of the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, I should add that Grampian water and sewerage department has allocated £2.5 million for new projects from current revenue in its 1993–94 budget. In 1994–95, it will have £4.5 million from that source. It is already financing projects without affecting the PSBR and does not need to be taken over by anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a couple of points that I hope will stick with the Minister and his officials. I do not know why the present arrangement for leases should run. The Carron dam is an example of moveable and removeable equipment being leased from a company, but fixed equipment, perhaps buildings, cannot be leased because that cannot be taken away by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was the treasurer and leader of Stirling district council, we financed a new management centre for Stirling university. It could not obtain university grants permission for it, so the council borrowed £2 million and leased the building to the university over 21 years. The day before the university's lease on the building ran out, the lease of the land on which it stood ran out for the council and the building became the property of the university. That happened because over 21 years all the capital and all the revenue charges were paid by the university. Public sector borrowing, the council accounts
	<span class='label label-info column'>1608</span>
and the university accounts were not affected. At the end of the day the user of the facility paid. Why cannot the Government enter into a similar agreement with local authorities? If, on the Carron site, for example, the council is willing, over 20 years, to build the facilities that are required to improve it, and to charge the people who use it, over those years, why cannot the same leasing arrangement be made? The builder would leave behind a building and land would become the council's property, paid for over that shorter period by the people who use the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the revenue system, I do not understand why the Government do not consider a more accountable system. At the moment water entirely clears its own feet. The council tax water charge is clearly shown to cover all the expense of the water service. I do not understand why the Government did not seriously consider disaggregating the cost of the sewerage service and including a similar sewerage charge with the council tax so that the charge out would clearly be to the user of the sewerage service. That charge would cover non-domestic service in many areas of my constituency where there is heavy industry, but it would also fall on the domestic user. All on-going costs of the service could then be financed from revenue. There is no reason not to have done that. It would have allowed the 12 joint boards that now exist, under local authority rules, to enter into a new relationship with the service and the Government. It would work and it would make the people happy that they were receiving the service that they wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is why the Government have not taken that course, which is sensible and logical and which was put forward by several authorities and by service employees and those working in finance, who know more about the subject than the Minister or most of his civil servants. I suggest that the real reason is that the Government wish to withdraw the £3 billion that is now committed, under the public sector borrowing requirement, over the next 15 years. That is the real target—to get that sum down so that when the massive quangos find it difficult to fund the capital, they can be told, "It's not working". It will be just as it was in England and Wales under the water authorities. They will not be able to fund the system, to keep it up to date, or to improve it. There will be only one way to obtain finance, as the Member for Tayside, North suggested—privatisation. That is the Government's real agenda. They do not know how to finance the £3 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Government that the revenue increases that will come from the process of withdrawing some of the capital borrowing permission, and the withdrawal of the sewerage service from its present grant-assessed expenditure status, will increase consumers' charges year by year. There will be less investment than required, and more charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that can stand between the people and the scenario that I have described is accountability. Our amendment suggests 12 water boards with elected members from the local authorities. They would be accountable to the people and would not be able to allow the service to fall into that state. They would have to face the reality of increasing charges to the consumer to ensure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0890">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1609</span>
the service that is required. Such joint boards would face that fact, because they would know that people would prefer a publicly-accountable, well financed local service to paying for something that will stagger to a halt and end up in the private sector. In that case they would have to pay for both the service and the profits and dividends of the people who run it. That is why the Government must attend to the amendments and seriously try to produce better proposals on Report. It is not possible for them to blunder on without paying the price at the next election. They will pay the price. The people will sweep them away and put in power a Labour Government which, sadly, will have to deconstruct the monoliths that will have been built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate since last Thursday night when the hon. Member for Hamilton moved the amendments, which we have debated with interest. I wish to reply to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who have raised important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never once criticised Strathclyde council or its officials who are responsible for delivering water and sewerage services. I want that to be on record because Opposition Members suggest that all Conservative Members criticise Strathclyde. We want to look much further forward than do Opposition Members. While the delivery of water and sewerage services in Scotland is basically sound, there is no reason why it cannot be even better in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr raised many points, but concentrated particularly on local authority representation on the water authorities and on the customer councils. It is important that he accepts that the Secretary of State intends to appoint local authority members to those new authorities. No doubt they will be nominated by local authorities, by COSLA or by other organisations. I am sure that local authority representatives on the water authorities and on the customer councils will make valuable contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that there will be local authority councillors on the new water boards. Will he explain whether they will form a majority on the boards, or will they be in the minority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot forecast the position, so it would be wrong of me to state whether they will form the majority or the minority. I am sure that it will depend on the entire board. I suggested this morning that the members might be involved in business, in water engineering or in other aspects that would be an asset to a water authority. Therefore, we must wait to see who will be the members of the boards. It is my view that people from all walks of professional and business life and from local authorities will be considered for positions on the boards.

My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not here, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is rushing in right now. He has stated clearly where his thoughts he, but accepts that our proposals are a good way forward for water delivery in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1610</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify that? The hon. Member for Tayside, North has been perfectly honest and straightforward in spelling out his belief that the best way forward is privatisation. What does the Minister mean by suggesting that the hon. Gentleman should be reassured by the Government's proposals? That seems to contradict completely the Minister's denial of our argument that the proposals are a step on the road to privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's logic is not clear. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North knows the position and supports the best proposals discussed by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a straightforward question. Why is it automatically an improvement to have 11 supposed experts who are not chosen by the people, but are hand-picked by the Secretary of State? Why does the Minister impose that on a population who simply do not want it? Why does he disregard the wishes of the people who have stated clearly that they do not want such an imposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disagree with the hon. Gentleman. We have had a consultation period during which the vast majority of people made clear that they did not want privatisation, but that they did want water to remain in public control. That is exactly what we are doing in creating public water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South rumbled the Opposition over the issue of joint boards. The hon. Member for Dundee, East is now a great protagonist of such boards, having opposed them throughout our debates in part I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, who spent a lot of his speech going over the objections to joint boards, has told us to listen to the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. It was the Government who supported joint boards, and defended them against the attacks of Opposition Members. We have now passed that part of the Bill, and the Government have got their way—joint boards will exist for a range of services, including police and fire services. The Minister cannot get away with slagging us off and repeating our own criticisms to us. He defended joint boards earlier, so why are they wrong for water services when they were right for the sort of services that we debated earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fought the imposition of joint boards throughout our debates on part I, but now he has made a U-turn. I do not follow his logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Gentleman who has made a U-turn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have had more experience of joint boards than the hon. Gentleman. I was a member and chairman of a joint board that covered five different authorities for 15 years. It worked very well in the right circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was it on water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not on water; it was on the police. As we explained this morning, there are new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1611</span>
attitudes to this issue. We must introduce a commercial approach to the delivery of water and sewerage services. That is achieved much more effectively by those who have professional experience in water and sewerage services, and they are the sort of people who will be on the water authority boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that the new arrangement will be more effective and efficient than the current set-up. Will he explain what is wrong with the extremely professional way in which these important services are being provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen. I said that I had no complaint about the delivery of water and sewerage services. [Hon. Members: "Why change it?"] I want to see it made better. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear".] The hon. Gentleman has no vision: he cannot understand that local authority provision can be improved. But I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he wants to see it better. Has he seen it at all? The answer may be yes, but I have not yet had a reply to my question about whether Ministers, who are taking on enormous responsibility in terms of services that already work well, have been to see the operation on which they are inflicting this upheaval. Have they spent a day at Strathclyde or Lothian to see the sophisticated structure that is in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is rather impatient. He must not think that I had forgotten his question. The answer is yes. Scottish Office engineers in the engineering, water and waste directorates are in daily contact with regional water authorities throughout Scotland. The Scottish Office engineers who have territorial responsibility are constantly working in the regions. There is no question of any failure to contact local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend the Minister would like to see water and sewerage facilities being handled, he can come to Alloway and Doonfoot in my constituency to see where a sewerage plant will be put. Such a plant, according to the convener of Strathclyde regional council, must not be located against domestic residence, yet domestic residences will border the new plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend look at the water supply for Ayr, which is dependent on a single leg from Braddon reservoir? It meant that just over a year ago, people in my constituency had no water for three days. If he came and saw for himself, perhaps he would realise that some of the criticism was justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The next time that I am in my hon. Friend's constituency I shall be glad to look at the operation. I understand a great deal of what is going on in Ayr. I have a paper giving the pros and cons of the Greenan and Newton proposals. I hope that that matter will be resolved soon because a great deal of expenditure is required to bring the situation in Ayr to a satisfactory conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will forgive his old parliamentary friend his anger. His answer was disingenuous. He was asked whether he, the Minister,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1612</span>
not the Scottish Office engineer, had been to see those authorities. I have a strong suspicion that the Scottish Office engineers, who are extremely intelligent and well-qualified people, are as horrified as many of us but they cannot give their personal opinions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister or any of his ministerial colleagues been to see this operation? Strathclyde, Lothian and Central say that they do not know of it. He might have been somewhere else. I do not believe that Ministers know at first hand that which they are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether the Scottish Office has been in touch with the authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, had Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully and I answered the question. No, I have not personnally been to see any of the three authorities that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I move about Scotland a great deal and see reservoirs and other facilities. I will not take it from him that the Scottish Office does not know what it is talking about, because it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow clarified the position on finance: his comments were in accordance with the facts. But what he did not say was that public expenditure and inflation are an important part of running a nation's economy. We cannot have an unlimited PSBR, as he would like, without running into high inflation, with the high unemployment that inevitably follows. The hon. Gentleman put only one biased if factually correct side of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley highlighted the issue of joint boards. He and the hon. Member for Dundee, East refused to accept my word on privatisation. I find that hard to take. When I give my word I mean it. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect to the longevity of Members of Parliament, I doubt whether the Minister will be here long enough to see that happen. That is the problem. The Minister may give assurances, but his fellow Ministers have not given the same assurances; neither has the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State gave assurances in Stranraer on Saturday. The hon. Gentleman does not read the newspapers. Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Dundee, East, have obviously conceded that the Conservatives will win the next election. That shows that they have no faith in their own policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to the transfer of sewerage and the loss of the revenue support grant. That has been considered. If the hon. Gentleman examines clause 77, he will see that there is provision for transitional relief to deal with that point. On future charging—I see that the hon. Gentleman has gone, so he has had it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Labour Members raised the important issue of disconnections and whether reference to them could be placed in the Bill. It is clear that, under the Water
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1613</span>
(Scotland) Act 1980, disconnection is not possible. That is the law at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is, because that is the position today. There is no reason why that should be changed in future. It is the law of the day. There is no reason to reinforce it in other legislation when we have no intention of changing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of disconnections, the 1980 Act sets out the legal position as a general duty. The duty covers every water authority. However, in this Bill, I see no reference to the three quangos to be created being defined as water authorities as under the 1980 Act. That is the issue and that is why we want a provision in the Bill so that we are in no doubt that the Government are true to the concept of no disconnections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information from officials makes it clear that there is no possibility of the disconnection of domestic supplies. I shall consider the matter and see whether it is necessary to include a provision in the Bill. At the moment, I see no reason why that should be done even though I have considered that point since lunchtime. I had wanted to mention the islands, but the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had full consultation. We are taking forward proposals for the best delivery of water and sewerage services in Scotland through the water authorities, the customer councils and the regional committees, which will give a clear chain of command so that everyone will have the chance to put their case democratically to the water authorities and, if necessary, to the Secretary of State. We are right to proceed with the Bill. Therefore, I do not recommend acceptance of any of the amendments to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not an adequate response. I regret that because we expected better of the Minister, who sat patiently through the 130 or more hours of our proceedings before we reached consideration of water. However, his response was characteristic of the way in which the Government have treated the Committee and the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anything will be remembered from the debate, it will be the dismissal of public opinion and the contempt for the attituded expressed by people in Scotland. That was encapsulated by the Minister's intemperate response to an intervention this morning. His answer to a question was, "Because I am telling you". That seems to sum up what the Government are saying to the electors of Eastwood and Ayr. However much the electors complain and proclaim that they understand what the Government are doing and that they will send them a message, the answer is, "We told you this is the best way of doing it; this is the best way; this will be what you get irrespective of what you want".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When future generations read the debate, they will be dismayed at a Government who have sown, in this Bill, the seeds of their destruction. They will see the seeds of the destruction of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
	<span class='label label-info column'>1614</span>
party in Committee Room 14, just as they will trace the seeds of the destruction of the Prime Minister to the Chamber of the House of Commons this afternoon, when one brave Back-Bench Member dared to express an opinion that we all know ran like a ripple through the Back Benches of the House of Commons. That ripple penetrated right down to the Front Bench. The arrogance displayed over water in Scotland and the amendments that have been tabled is displayed also on a much wider stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We and other people outside the House will examine the Government's arguments, which are based on the philosophy of "Because I said so." The hon. Member for Tayside, North articulated the argument that elected councillors could not be trusted on the committees because they might take decisions that reflected the views of the people whom they represent. Those councillors might listen to people about water charges, and the hon. Member for Tayside, North gave the impression that that would be bad. So why do we not disband the Committee? After all, the three Ministers could pick a group of people as acquiescent as the Conservative Members whom they have chosen. Why bother having a Parliament? What an inconvenience, what a bother for Ministers to have to turn up and listen to Opposition Members, who for example went to the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastwood on Saturday and brought him the views of his constituents. It is very inconvenient to be told the views of your electorate in a Committee of the House of Commons. Everything is inconvenient for the Government. Their rationale, blurted out by the hon. Member for Tayside, North is now on the record—you cannot trust the people, with their views about legislation. They certainly cannot be left to run the water authorities, because they might listen to public opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just so that there is no misunderstanding, I made it clear that the proposed structures will put in place the disciplines that will require that the funding is found properly. I have no confidence in councillors who would not or could not find the funding for housing in Scotland. They created a massive problem. Through housing benefit, they could have channelled massive funds into council coffers. They did not do so because they were buying cheap votes. I have always said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Sir James, are a politician from a pretty hard school. The Conservative party put up a candidate against you at the previous election, so no one can tell you much about the workings of democratic politics. No one who does not listen to the electors remains in the House or in the Government. Perhaps we have been in opposition too long, but we are seeing, in the dying days of the Government, an arrogance that will guarantee that they will be out for a long time. People will listen to the words of the hon. Member for Tayside, North and his ilk. They say that because people listen to electors and go looking for votes they cannot be trusted to run water services. Those elected councillors have run water services for 150 years, since only a tiny number of electors were represented right up to today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how strongly the hon. Member for Tayside, North supports the Government now, because I heard some of what he said on television today. However, his Government's consultative document stated:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0893">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1615</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the years local authorities of various sizes and configurations have shown that they can effectively deliver water and sewerage services."</p></blockquote>
Of course they have. They have not been swayed by electors. They have produced water that people can drink safely from the tap. The same cannot be claimed by most of the countries in the European Union. Elected councillors have made that possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps people should listen to the hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs). He has remained silent today, and for all the 138 hours of our proceedings. I do not think that he has uttered a single word, apart from aye and no, according to what the Conservative Whip tells him. However, the hon. Gentleman recently made a speech in the House during a debate on the Child Support Act 1991. The hon. Gentleman is a critic of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1616</span>
