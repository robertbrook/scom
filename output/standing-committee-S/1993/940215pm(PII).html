<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>[continuation from column 350]</p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was asked earlier why I have tabled so many amendments. I have tabled amendments where others have not because I believe that cases such as that of Dunfermline need a hearing. There is a good case for giving the matter careful consideration. I recognise that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has tabled another amendment on the Fife area in which he suggests a district council for north-east Fife. It is a pity that Dunfermline, west Fife, north-east Fife and Kirkcaldy could not have put together a mutually acceptable amendment. If they had, we would have been a lot more confident of persuading the Government of the merits of such a proposal.<br><br>
Dunfermline and west Fife are an identifiable unit. Community councils have backed that option to the hilt, and it has strong business support. I recognise that there are discussions on whether Kincardine should be part of Dunfermline and west Fife council. I stand apart from that argument, principally because I have a link with Scottish Power, which is very keen that Kincardine should move into Fifeshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. I am going through the arguments quickly.<br><br>
When examining the relationship between Dunfermline and the rest of Fife, it is important to consider how Dunfermline sits with Kirkcaldy, how Kirkcaldy sits with north-east Fife and how north-east Fife sits with the rest of Fife. I believe that there has always been some antipathy between Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy and that the two communities do not merge well. Dumfermline sits well as the centre of a west Fife district extending to Lockgelly, Lochore, Ballingry and westwards to Valleyfield, taking in the areas around Oakley and Saline. Kirkcaldy perhaps identifies with the East Neuk and the fishing villages as far as St. Andrews. North-east Fife, perhaps with Newtown and Newburgh, has a stronger link with Dundee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
There is a great question mark over the idea of Fife as a unitary authority. Dunfermline district, which, with a population of 129,000, is a good size for a unitary authority, could provide the necessary services, identify local needs in planning and provide leisure and environmental policies to suit the local populace. It would be able to combine housing and social services in a way that would serve the community well. Glenrothes almost certainly could not reflect local identity on the real issues of local government, and it is crucial to be seen to be at the heart of the community.<br><br>
I accept that Glenrothes could perhaps manage issues such as education for a unitary authority of Fife, but local issues such as planning, housing and leisure need a smaller unit of local government. There are good public transport links in the west Fife area which would allow people to centre around Dunfermline. I do not believe that there are such good links in the rest of Fife, which is a disadvantage to people in the Dunfermline district.<br><br>
The Touche Ross report shows that savings could be made with a unitary authority based on Dunfermline and west Fife but, to be fair, it says that the Fife option might offer greater savings. The important point is that quality of service and individual identity—which, as the Secretary of State requests, should reflect and represent local loyalties and allegiances—would be best achieved by a single authority based on Dunfermline and west Fife district.<br><br>
I believe that Dunfermline and west Fife offer a good and strong local authority unit that would serve the people of that part of Fife well into the future. We are aiming for long-term local government units that people can feel comfortable with. I am pleased to commend amendment No. 82, which would create a single-tier Dunfermline and west Fife authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendment No. 40, explain the background to it and, in passing, refer to the starred amendments that are in my name—Nos. 140 to 142. I know that I cannot expound the virtues of those starred amendments in any way.<br><br>
The starting point of the case for creating a council for north east Fife is that, because of the Government's policy decisions about local authorities in other parts of Scotland that have populations of about 60,000 size is not and cannot be the sole determinant of effectiveness. The Minister probably agrees that special circumstances deserve special consideration in the consultation process and in his explanation of the Government's policy of creating the new authority areas. I shall argue that there are special circumstances in Fife which could lead one to the conclusion that north-east Fife requires special consideration.<br><br>
If the Minister is to set his face against the amendment, I think that he has a duty to say precisely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
why he is opposed to it. I warn him—if the Whip has finished with him—that the Committee will take careful note of the arguments that he adduces against a free-standing unitary authority in north-east Fife, so that we can remind him of those arguments when we come to later stages of the Bill that deal with proposals for local authority areas closer to the Minister's home.<br><br>
The Committee is in a good position to determine whether it believes that north-east Fife differs from the rest of Fife. Members of the Committee have the advantage of having received the document called "The case for a north-east Fife Council", which was sent by North East Fife district council. I commend that document to members of the Committee who have not yet read it. In the conclusion to the document, the facts shine through: north-east Fife is a predominantly rural area, with a distinctive economy and economic needs and problems different from those of conurbations in the other Fife districts. The area has a different social and political culture which must be recognised. I hope the Minister agrees that the case has been made.<br><br>
The Committee should pay careful attention to the results of the independent survey of public opinion carried out in north-east Fife, which show little support for the establishment of an all-Fife authority. Only 13.4 per cent. of those surveyed expressed support for such an authority, while 45 per cent. were in favour of keeping the status quo—more than half of whom said that they felt that way because they liked a small local council. That is significant. Also, 32 per cent. were in favour of a unitary, smaller, more locally-based authority, so there is evidence that local opinion runs with the grain of the case that has been made by North-East Fife council.<br><br>
There is anecdotal social evidence that shows that the residents of Kirkcaldy and Dunfermline also have a strong preference for locally-based councils, which is why I have tabled amendments Nos. 140, 141 and 142.<br><br>
If North-East Fife were to be part of an all-Fife authority, it could, as the Minister would have to concede, be eclipsed by the all-Fife authority, because—the estimates vary—it might be able to send to the larger authority about 18 of the total 91 councillors. That would be serious, because its representation, in terms of services, and its accountability to its own local community would risk being seriously diluted. Travel-to-work areas, shopping patterns and other, anecdotal, evidence show a clear pattern that suggests that the people of north-east Fife make much greater reference to Dundee and Perth than they do to Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes.<br><br>
The community councils in north-east Fife have made their positions clear. They are concerned, for example, that the trusts, that have become well-established, that provide leisure and recreational services could be at risk if North-East Fife loses its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
independent status and does not become a unitary authority.<br><br>
Accountability is an important matter for the Committee to consider. There is at least a suspicion that an all-Fife authority would be considered remote and inaccessible by the people of north-east Fife who believe—I think rightly—that spending priorities in particular should be determined locally. In their view, that would not be possible with an all-Fife authority.<br><br>
If, in spite of all that, the Minister is still considering a bigger, all-Fife solution, he has a duty to make clear the kind of decentralisation that he believes would be necessary to deal with some of the points that North-East Fife council raised when arguing for its own free-standing authority. He has not done that in any of the debates so far, but it is important that local people have a flavour of what the Minister has in store for them.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister accepts that there is a recognition that a smaller authority such as North-East Fife—he may have others in mind that we will consider later—can provide quality services quite cost-effectively by expanding their enabling role and by using a flexible and value-for-money approach to service provision. Local people in north-east Fife would not shy away from adopting such methods, and they are confident that they could introduce them in a way that would be sensitive, cost-effective and efficient. They understand that by providing some services directly, buying in some specialist services from other authorities, and working in effective partnership with agencies in the private sector, the new councils that the Bill will create could easily perform the functions that we require of them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr referred to the financial provisions and transitional costs and savings. An all-Fife solution would probably be cheaper in the longer term, but not by a significant factor.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
The financial estimates that I have seen do not seem to show that the savings would be so clinching as to rule out all other options. North-East Fife council could make a case that it would still yield savings of nearly £500,000 per annum over a payback period of 3.1 years, according to its own calculations. That is a significant saving, and the Committee should give it equal consideration with the other options.<br><br>
The Government's proposals have little support either in north-east Fife or in Fife as a whole. The submissions that the Committee has seen show a strong preference for a smaller, more locally-based council that would better understand the needs of local communities, would be more directly accountable to its electorate and would provide services that are easily accessible to residents throughout the district. I hope that the Minister will consider the case for North-East Fife council with the same care that he has shown in dealing with other areas.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
Other options may be viable for Fife. There are close parallels with the Government's conclusion—inspired, if that is the right verb, by the hon. Member for Ayr—about the solution for Ayrshire. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not want to become involved in that—the Government accepted the initiative taken by the hon. Member for Ayr. There are parallels between Ayr and Fife. The local authorities are of a similar size. I was taken aback when the Government made their concession on Ayr.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Gentleman is not the only one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is not the last word on the subject. I look forward to taking part in further debate. Whether the Government were right or wrong on Ayr, the parallels are there. If the Minister intends to give the Ayr treatment to Fife, he should consider free-standing unitary authorities for the three districts. That would be consistent with the decision on Ayr.<br><br>
I had expected the Government to come up with a much clearer, more coherent and up-front defence of their descriptions of the new councils in the Bill. If I had been expecting so much flexibility—or perhaps it is confusion—from the Government I should have given much more encouragement to those who have been making the case for Dunfermline being a freestanding authority. I am driven to conclude that, if what was good enough for Ayr last week is good enough for Fife this week, the Government cannot deny the right of Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy authorities to be free-standing.<br><br>
I cannot agree with the prescription for the rest of Fife suggested by the hon. Member for Ayr in his amendment on Dunfermline, but given what has happened in the Committee I give unqualified support to the case for Dunfermline standing in its own right, without getting involved in what effect that would have on the other two elements in the Fife options. A three-Fife option is a runner, certainly if the logic of the Ayr decision is carried through, and Fife deserves the same treatment. I hope that the Minister will give that active consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments brings into sharp focus the division of opinion—I am constantly saying that—on the new structure for Fife. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire suggested a new proposition in the latter half of his speech. He will recognise that the three-district option is not before the Committee, nor has it been suggested, to my knowledge.<br><br>
The hon. Member suggested that a north-east Fife authority, with a population of about 69,000, and a south Fife authority, with a population of nearly a quarter of a million, should be established. That proposition was put to me by an all-party delegation, led by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell), from North-East Fife district council.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
I must declare a personal interest—in the best sense—in north-east Fife. I was born, brought up and educated there, and—my hon. Friends should wait for this—I was a vice-chairman of the Liberal association; I have moved to the right since then. I admitted that because I was sure that the political historians from the Opposition would have reminded me of it if I had not done so.<br><br>
The proposition of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire broadly follows the lines of the Wheatley proposal at the time of the previous reorganisation. Wheatley also made the point that north-east Fife looks towards Dundee and Perth. Circumstances have changed, but the Wheatley proposals led to widespread disagreement across all parties in Fife. There was a massive campaign for a Fife authority, and the Government have had to bear that in mind.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr advanced the case for an alternative two-way split, which would link Kirkcaldy with north-east Fife to from an east Fife authority, so that Dunfermline would form a west Fife authority—the west Fife case. My hon. Friend attracted extraordinary criticism from Opposition Members for advancing that case, despite the fact that the case was proposed by a delegation that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West introduced to the Scottish Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just in case these proceedings penetrate beyond the four walls of the Committee Room, and before the mythology that the Minister is encouraging grows, I make it clear that hon. Members have facilitated visits by local, authorities to the Minister not necessarily because they agree with every dot and comma of the submissions, but because their role, as Members of Parliament, is to act as an intermediary. The fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West introduced the delegation to the Minister should not be taken to mean that she endorsed the case for a unitary authority for Dunfermline, which I fear is the Minister's implication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the implication of what I said. My hon. Friends will confirm that I used the term "introduced". That is part of the hon. Lady's job. I have said that before, and I am glad to see that on this occasion, when I repeat it, hon. Members are hanging on my every syllable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may not recall the terms he used in the past and it is not a question of anyone being more sensitive than anyone else. Unfortunately he is on record in <i>Hansard</i> as repeatedly using the phrase "led a delegation" when referring to matters in my region. I thought it was a figure of speech that could be explained away, but the Minister uses other terms in this case. It is important that the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton is put on the record. People get the impression that no one is taken to meet a Minister unless their case is endorsed or supported by the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
Member who takes them. Our job is surely to allow anyone the facility to meet a Minister when they feel that they have a case to put. We are not there to screen who should have access.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the point has been put on the record by the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Hamilton and me the Committee can agree on it.<br><br>
It is clear that there is no unanimity over what the new structure for Five should be. There are strong and compelling arguments for a single Fife authority. There are unquestionably strong feelings of identity with Fife rooted in the integrity that Fife has enjoyed since the sixth century. There is also a geographical identity. There is little doubt that many people, myself included, identify themselves as Fifers, at least in origin. The arguments about Fife were extensively debated at the time of the last reorganisation. The then Government were correct to reflect public opinion as clearly expressed across all parties and to decide in favour of the Fife authority.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire quite reasonably asked me about decentralisation and the importance of taking full account of the interests of the people of north-east Fife in the context of a single Fife authority. I entirely agree with that. Fife regional council has established four area offices in conjunction with Dunfermline district. It is seeking to develop that programme in conjunction with other districts, but that of course depends on the districts' co-operation.<br><br>
Hon. Members have referred to public opinion. I agree with the comments made about the record of north-east Fife and Dunfermline district in terms of economy and efficiency. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr is right about that. There has been considerable support for a Fife authority from community councils, voluntary organisations and the Fife chamber of commerce and industry which represents over 450 companies. All hon. Members will be aware of the representations that have been put forward by Fife regional council on cost terms.<br><br>
I do not dispute that both hon. Members who have spoken have a case, but on balance I believe—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate the Minister on making an excellent case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I am beginning to get rather worried, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The balance of the argument is in favour of a single-tier Fife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that 20 years ago to the day on 15 February 1973—that is 21 years in fact—<i>[Laughter.]</i> Arithmetic never was my strong point. Twenty-one years ago to the day, Fife was discussed by the Committee considering the then Local Government Bill. Mr. Alex Eadie, who represented one of the Fife constituencies said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is natural that in advancing the case for Fife, there will be a certain amount of emotion, compassion and sentiment … This is not based on sentiment or passion, but is based on the fact that Fife is an administrative local government unit."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 15 February 1973; c.454.]</p></blockquote>
Twenty-one years later, the Minister reinforces his commitment to a common-sense solution for an important part of Scotland. We shall raise points about quality services; value for money—in the widest sense of that phrase—commitment to good local government and good housekeeping.<br><br>
The Minister alluded to his strong links with Fife. We are not embarrassed by the fact that he used to be a Liberal. I shudder to think that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire might become like the Minister.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire—I will not tell too much, Archy—was an active member of the Labour party for many years. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan), the late Bailie James McInally and I were members of the St. Giles ward of the Labour party. We spent many hours together. We all have skeletons in the cupboard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those comments illuminate our important debate about flexibility. We now know that flexibility exists among political parties. I shudder to think that a Liberal could move as far to the right as the Minister has done. However, to contribute to the atmosphere of bonhomie, I must say that the Minister has done an excellent job for Fife.<br><br>
The debate has echoed the sentiments of previous discussions. The Government are now looking at a map of Scotland that reflects people's views. We are achieving consensus about a common-sense issue. I am pleased that we have had the debate. We do not mind which hon. Members table amendments. We have simply asked for the basic courtesies of the House to be extended to hon. Members who have an active interest and involvement in the issues that we are discussing.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr apologised this morning, and we welcome that. The Minister has also accepted that the basic courtesies of the House should be extended to everyone. No Opposition Member would argue that an hon. Member does not have the right to table amendments. However, an hon. Member who tables an amendment that refers to another hon. Member's constituency should inform the relevant hon. Member.<br><br>
I do not want to prolong our proceedings because we know the Government's decision. I was struck by a small point in a letter from the Minister to Fife regional council. The Minister has claimed that he is a good Fifer. Therefore, it is important to put on record that in correspondence with the Fife convenor, the Minister finished his letter with the words:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Best wishes, and Fife forever!</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Yours,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Allan."</p></blockquote>
I can say no more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot follow that, except to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stark's park in Kirkcaldy on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A pleasure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, it was not a pleasure because Raith Rovers won and the team that they were playing lost. However, while I was there I had the pleasure of meeting Sir George Sharp. Scottish members of the Committee who were involved in local government before 1975 will know that Sir George was the convenor of Fife county council. He more than anyone ensured that Fife remained an authority after the local government reorganisation. I passed the time of day and shared some reminiscences with him, and was reminded of that when my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was speaking. I know that my hon. Friend recalls Sir George with warmth and reverence.<br><br>
The Minister has just made one of the best speeches that I have ever heard him make in his career. He outlined a powerful case for a single-tier, all-purpose, all-Fife authority which has the support of most of the community councils in the area. I made the same argument in favour of Ayrshire. The Minister said that the chamber of commerce, on behalf of industry and commerce, supported an all-Fife authority. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) will recall that I made the same case for Ayrshire, and that I quoted Richard Cole-Hamilton, the chairman of the Ayrshire chamber of commerce and industry. The Minister also made a powerful argument for an efficient authority. He said that an authority the size of Fife could deliver all its services efficiently and effectively. That was almost the exact wording that I used about Ayrshire the other day.<br><br>
The Minister recounted his experiences as a Fifer. I recall the old saying that it takes a "lang spoon to sup wi' a Fifer", but that is just as unfair as the stories about people from the north-east of Scotland being mean and crabbit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are certainly not crabbit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got it in one.<br><br>
The Minister described Fife's strong feeling of local identity in terms that I used about Ayrshire. People from Auchinleck, for example, still write Ayrshire in their address, rather than Cumnock and Doon Valley or Strathclyde. That is the same sense of local identity that is evident in Fife. The Minister said that the size of Fife was ideal, and optimum for the services that could be provided. I think that the Minister will agree
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
that the size of Fife is similar to that of Ayrshire, although it is not exactly the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with interest, but find it hard to follow his logic. His speech seems to be about Ayrshire, rather than Fife, which is the subject of the amendment. I thought that we had agreed about Ayrshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am arguing very strongly in support of an all-Fife authority. I support the Minister and have complimented him on his speech. Just by way of illustration, I am saying that the Minister's arguments correspond almost exactly with those that I put forward in favour of Ayrshire.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central I can see a strategy for most of Scotland developing in the Minister's mind. In the debate about Clydesdale, in which he agreed with me that Clydesdale could not deliver the whole range of services, the Minister supported a South Lanarkshire authority. Incidentally, Clydesdale is close to my constituency. When the people of Muirkirk hold their annual race to the top of Cairn table, which is visible from Muirkirk, they run into the Clydesdale district. Of course, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) will affirm, I have never taken part in that race. Glenbuck is adjacent to Clydesdale and is the home of the famous football team, the Glenbuck Cherry Pickers, and of Bill and Bob Shankly, who subsequently made their names beyond Ayrshire.<br><br>
When we were discussing South Lanarkshire, the Minister rightly accepted a South Lanarkshire authority, which would deliver services efficiently and effectively and would be roughly the size of Ayrshire. It was then suggested that the North Lanarkshire authority should be divided. The Minister accepted an authority about the size of Fife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member intervenes, may I point out that although my knowledge of Scotland may not be as good as that of other hon. Members present, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should restrict his remarks to Fife. Earlier, he related Ayr to Fife, but we are not debating Fife. I hope that the intervention will be about Fife too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to draw attention to the fact that the hon. Gentleman was wandering from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituency is visible from your part of the United Kingdom, Sir James. We have strong links.<br><br>
I was trying to say that Fife, as a single, all-purpose authority, fits in with the pattern in North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire, but not Ayrshire. I was glad that the Minister assured us that he is willing to meet a deputation from Ayrshire to have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
another look at the matter. As the pattern emerges, it would be unfortunate if glaring anomalies that did not fit in with the excellent scheme that has been adopted for Fife emerged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was greatly relieved by the Minister's decision to keep Fife intact. I was a little apprehensive during the speech of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire when he pointed to the close link between Dundee and north-east Fife. Given our earlier debate about districts at either end of bridges, I feared that the Minister might have been attracted by that logic and that he might have included north-east Fife with Dundee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) might think that that is a good idea. He is right that the people of north-east Fife have only to cross the bridge to commute to Dundee. Clearly, the links between the two exist. In fact, the Wheatley commission proposed to split Fife along those lines. I feared that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire might have given the Minister an idea that he might pursue. That threat has now passed.<br><br>
There is, however, still some unfinished business about the boundaries of Fife and their relation to Kincardine. I am speaking now only because the hon. Member for Ayr not give way during his speech. He referred to his interests in Scottish Power and to the concern that it has expressed about the Government's boundary proposals. It has written to me, so I imagine that it has written to the hon. Member for Ayr—because he must earn his corn.<br><br>
Scottish Power wrote to me about the boundary that would have split East Lothian, but which we have not got rid of. That boundary would have split the Cockenzie power station from the ash lagoons into which it discharges the ash from the power station. Luckily, we have got rid of that boundary, but there is the question of Fife, the home of Longannet power station.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is Fife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is right. The trouble is that Longannet power station is in the neighbourhood of Kincardine, on Forth—I think that it is in the Tulliallan parish. The grounds of the power station will be divided by the Government's suggested boundary between Fife and the new Clackmannan and Falkirk council. In addition, the ash lagoons, where all the Longannet power station's ash is discharged, will be in Fife. There could be different planning authorities for the power station and for the area where it discharges its ash. That would be a bizarre situation, and a recipe for much conflict of interest and difficulty. I strongly support the Minister's view that Fife should be kept intact, but let us keep the whole of Fife intact so that we avoid such anomalies.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
I have already said that Scottish Power has written to me expressing concern about the Government's proposed boundaries. The letter says that the daftest situation of the two is at Longannet, where the station side will be split by the local government boundary. Scottish Power's view is that as no voters live in the ash lagoons, perhaps good sense could prevail. There is not much hope of that, as we are dealing with the hon. Member for Ayr, who is supposed to be representing the interests of Scottish Power in these and other matters. It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman did not make those representations—however, I do so now. There is still a serious outstanding anomaly in respect of the boundary between Kincardine and the rest of Fife, and the Minister should do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend listened carefully to the speech of the hon. Member for Ayr, but I distinctly heard the hon. Gentleman say that because of his interests in Scottish Power, he would not take part in any discussions about Kincardine remaining part of Fife. There would be a clear conflict of interest for him because of his relationship with Scottish Power. That being so, he should not vote on the issue either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Never mind, I take my hon. Friend's point about the position of the hon. Member for Ayr, but it is not appropriate for me to comment.<br><br>
The issue was initially drawn to my attention in relation to Cockenzie power station. It has arisen again in the context of Longannet and the valley field lagoons. It is absurb that the curtilage of a power station should be split by a boundary between planning authorities. I realise that it has to do with the need to create a bridge link between Clackmannan and Falkirk, but it would give rise to an absurd set of circumstances. I hope that the Minister will address the problem, not least because of the invidious position that Scottish Power will be in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is peculiar that the hon. Member for Ayr has not been approached by the creatures from the lagoon, because he has been approached by everyone else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: References to creatures from the lagoon raise horrifying spectres of the hon. Member for Ayr and other things.<br><br>
I have concluded my remarks. I hope that the Minister will address the problems of Longannet power station and the lagoons when the final decision about Kincardine is made. The people of Kincardine clearly want to remain in Fife. I hope that the Minister will take that into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few final remarks on amendment No. 40. In the past few debates, there have been conflicting signals from the Minister—that may sound pejorative, but it is meant to be neutral—about what he is prepared to do regarding the future of Central, North Lanarkshire,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
Midlothian and East Lothian, about which he has reserved his position to a degree. He was generous in saying that he is prepared to consider matters further. What is the situation in relation to Fife? Is the Minister saying that we have reached a line in the sand beyond which he will not go?<br><br>
It would be better, even a kindness, if the uncertainty was ended now, even if the Minister gave an answer that many people did not want to hear. That is preferable to increasing expectations and aspirations when people will inevitably be let down in the future. It would help the Committee if the Minister said two sentences about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's points are fair. Ministers should never say "never" because circumstances can change. What I said to him was a firm statement of the Government's position.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to establish a link at an early stage. The link is that I spent 18 years as manager of Inverkip power station in Inverclyde. I spent a lot of time working with the local authority—and a strong authority it was.<br><br>
Representations have been made to me through local links such as the district council and by people of all political persuasions. There has also been a link with the hon. Members for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) and for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
The background to the amendment has to be studied, as has the input of Inverclyde to the document "The Structure of Local Government in Scotland: The Case for Change", in which its confidence about going it alone is emphasised. It was a great shock to Inverclyde when the White Paper "Shaping the Future—The New Councils" was published because it had been anticipated that there would be a union between the Greenock and Port Glasgow-Inverclyde district and Paisley. Greenock and Port Glasgow has few direct links with Paisley and a union was not thought to be an option.<br><br>
It has been suggested to me that Greenock and Port Glasgow's link would have been more relevant if taken up the M8 towards Glasgow rather than off the M8 towards Paisley. That is a fair point.<br><br>
I could go through the arguments about the provision of services but I have made them repeatedly when discussing local services provided for local people, and do not need to do so again. Inverclyde district council has already established a great rapport and can demonstrate that it can take a further step and become a unitary authority.<br><br>
I draw the attention of the Committee to a petition that was delivered by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) to the Minister. It contained 38,000 signatures out of a total of about 70,000 people on the voters' roll in Inverclyde—there are 95,000 in Inverclyde district. That should weigh heavily with every member of the Committee. I ask my hon. Friend to pay particular attention to it when he winds up.<br><br>
This debate compares with our previous debate on Ayrshire when my hon. Friend the Minister wisely listened to the council's views and decided that the interests of Ayrshire would be best served by three separate unitary authorities. There is a great link between Ayrshire and its neighbouring county of Renfrewshire, of which Inverclyde is a part. If my hon. Friend were to decide on three unitary authorities for Renfrewshire, that would follow on from his logic and from the credibility that he gained with every member of the Committee when he decided on the three-way Ayrshire split.<br><br>
I commend to my hon. Friend the representations made to him and to other hon. Members from Inverclyde district council. I commend the actions of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow, and I ask my hon. Friend to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support amendments No. 37, 111 and 112. I also want to make a fleeting reference to amendment No. 118.<br><br>
It is ironic that the debate on the amendments to the proposals for Renfrewshire is the last to take place, because anyone who has followed the passage of the Bill will know that the first boundary to be drawn was the boundary of East Renfrewshire. It is ironic also that the debate is taking place at a time
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
when it is not possible for many members of the public from that area to be present since, as everyone knows, there is immense interest in the matter.<br><br>
This boundary was the first to be drawn; it was the first brick in the wall. Following the Minister's press statement on the boundary, it is clear that East Renfrewshire is not so much a local authority as an ego trip for the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Come on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am telling the Minister: that is my interpretation and opinion of what I have observed. As I develop my speech, I shall refer to newspaper articles with which I can convince other members of the Committee, if not the hon. Gentleman, that that is so. Like the cartoon character Linus in the comic strip, "Peanuts", which also features Charlie Brown, the Minister has his security blanket, the little comforter without which he cannot go anywhere. His little comforter is Eastwood. Unfortunately, the good people of Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor, Ralston and West Dykebar must also be included in that area, for no other reason than to bulk up numbers.<br><br>
Those who have studied the boundaries between the authorities and the 49 lines that it takes to describe the boundary of East Renfrewshire know that it is not a natural boundary. It exists only in the Minister's mind. It used to be the boundary of a parliamentary constituency, which was itself an artificial boundary—I shall explain later how artificial it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will concede that it is not just an historic constituency boundary. It was the boundary between the old Renfrewshire county and the borough of Paisley. There is no doubt about that.</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p>[Mr. Michael J. Martin <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many houses have been built along that boundary since then and many services are delivered to people living there. It would be pathetic, if only it did not affect the lives of so many people.<br><br>
We should not be under the illusion that the boundary has been drawn objectively or after consultation with the public. It has been drawn under the Minister's hand. There is no independent commission to draw up the boundaries in Scotland; this one was drawn up hastily, perhaps in the drawing room of Crofthead house in Nielston, and perhaps with the assistance of Douglas Mason, the architect of the poll tax, who, no matter which hon. Member is accused of doing the job, is the man who ultimately brought down the former leader of the Conservative party.<br><br>
Conservative Members might have a sense of déjà vu, because the boundary will be so unpopular that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
the Conservatives in that area will pay the price for it. If it is the best boundary that the Minister can propose, he is clearly at his most dangerous when at his most creative. The Minister admitted—if that is the word—that he was the architect of the boundary. The <i>Eastwood Extra</i> on 2 September last year said:
<br><blockquote><p>"On an unusually blissful late summer's morning, the local Government Minister is quietly getting ready to play his part as key architect of the most significant changes to the political map of Scotland since the '70s."</p></blockquote>
That proves two things: first, that the Minister cannot see an unusually blissful morning without spoiling it for everyone else; secondly, that he has acknowledged that he was a key architect not of the local government map of Scotland but of the political map. I believe the <i>Eastwood Extra.</i> There is a well known local story that the paper once ran a photograph of the Minister with a large, hairy and fierce dog over the caption, "Allan Stewart is the one on the right"—<i>[Laughter.]</i><br><br>
The boundary of east Renfrewshire is gerrymandered, and it is not even good gerrymandering. For example, there was confusion about the original description of the boundary. There were 450 people in the Dyke Barn housing estate in my constituency who had every reason—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I understood that there was a ruling that the word "gerrymander" should not be used. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that hon. Members should not be accused of gerrymandering but that political parties may well be so accused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. If I heard the hon. Member correctly, he said it with reference to the Government and to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not pick up the hon. Gentleman as attacking the Minister in that manner. The hon. Gentleman kept clearly within the guidelines that I gave the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not challenge that point of order, Mr. Martin. An excerpt from the <i>Evening Times</i> of 10 February states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Allan Stewart is alarmingly frank about the alleged call to gerrymander sent out by his local grass roots party workers.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>He claims the 1991 submission of the Eastwood Tories to the Scottish Office accepted the principles on which new local government systems should be based!</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Mr. Stewart added:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'And they then said—not terribly surprisingly—that they thought these should be applied, but that it shouldn't be to the electoral disadvantage of the Conservative party.'"</p></blockquote>
If the Minister admits that he gerrymandered the boundaries, I do not see why we should not be able to accuse him of doing so. Of course, I always refer to you, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman surely realises that the document in question was from a political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
organisation and has been on the public record for years. There is nothing new about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so. What is new is that the Minister has admitted gerrymandering the boundaries. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has not admitted in Committee to gerrymandering. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not accuse him of any such thing, especially after my ruling. Perhaps I have given members of the Committee a loophole, in that they can accuse political parties of becoming involved in certain matters, but hon. Members do not get involved in these things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that reluctantly, Mr. Martin. May I say, then, that the Minister belongs to a political party that has been guilty of gerrymandering? His involvement in that process has not been good enough to be called political gerrymandering, for reasons that I shall give. If he had been good at it, he would not have run the original boundary through a house. He would not have had a family's living room in East Renfrewshire, and the kitchen in West Renfrewshire, so that the wife—perhaps that is sexist; I do not have a wife—or whoever was doing the washing in one part would be hanging it out in another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking absolute codswallop. None of it is true; it is a complete fabrication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking the truth. I did not interpret the boundaries, they were interpreted by professionals working for various local authorities which were not all involved in the process. There were cases where one could envisage a person doing the washing in East Renfrewshire and hanging it out to dry in West Renfrewshire. That is not good gerrymandering.<br><br>
Perhaps I should now be a little more gracious to the Minister. I was delighted when in a parliamentary answer to me he quickly acknowledged that Dykebar housing was to be restored to Renfrew district. That was good news because the local authority held a referendum in which 78.4 per cent. of the people in the area voted, and 91.2 per cent. of them voted against the Government's proposals. The question they were asked was stark and simple. It was: do you support the Government's proposals for East Renfrewshire? There were 91.2 per cent. who said no. I shall return to the matter of west Dykebar.<br><br>
Confusion surrounds the wording of schedule 1. There is speculation that 14 houses are missing. I refer the Committee to lines 12–15 of schedule 1 according to which, the Renfrew district council tells me, the addresses of 22 to 48 Ben Wyvis drive are not in any local authority. That is significant because it means that the hon. Member for Ayr has suggested not a three-option but a four-option solution for Renfrewshire. I am tempted to buy one of those 14
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
houses, move into it and see whether I can become the provost, because I have come this far without a chain.<br><br>
I have a much more definitive point to raise—it is not confusing, it is a fact. Hon. Members have referred to lines 19 and 22 of the schedule on page 117, which state that the A727 is a boundary of east Renfrewshire. The A727 no longer exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happened to it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Part of it is now called the B767. It runs from the Gorbals to Clarkston—several miles away from Renfrewshire. If the Bill had been drafted properly, it would have referred to the A726 which runs from Erskine to Strathan. One digit is different, but that is a very important difference.<br><br>
There is also confusion about the municipal golf course at Barshaw park. The park and the golf course are in the same area, but the park will be in West Renfrewshire and the golf course will be in East Renfrewshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where will the clubhouse be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The good news is that the clubhouse will be in West Renfrewshire, so the Labour authority will take the money and the Tory authority will cut the grass. As a horticulturalist, I think that that is a good deal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman entirely supports that boundary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That boundary has a special place in my heart, because when I worked as an apprentice for Renfrew district council—which was not only a good authority of which to be a member, but an excellent authority to be employed by—I worked in Barshaw park and I used to cut the grass. I am grateful that I cut the grass for a Labour council and not for a Tory council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A possible Tory council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it remains to be seen whether it becomes a Tory council.<br><br>
For some reason the Minister, or the party to which he belongs, has drawn a boundary at Dykebar hospital to take it into East Renfrewshire. That is perhaps neither here nor there, except for one family who live in the grounds of Dykebar hospital. Access to their house is from Paisley. That would involve the bin lorry coming from Barrhead, at the closest point, travelling along Grahamston road, down Barrhead road for a half a mile or so into Paisley, along Lochfield road and back up the back of Dykebar hospital to collect the bin. If that is what the Minister means by Tory efficiency he should have a rethink.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should go the other way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. I think that the bin lorry should go the other way, because the hospital should be in West Renfrewshire.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having observed the conduct of Tory Members in the Committee, I think that if it is a Conservative authority it should have efficient street sweepers and bin men. Given the state of this Committee Room in the area where the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is sitting, there will be a lot of work to be done.</span></p>
<p>10.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The letters on the floor are probably from people in Barrhead, or even from people in Ralston who want nothing to do with the Minister because they have dealt with him before. Ralston is linked to the rest of east Renfrewshire only by a greenfield belt. It is physically isolated and there are no public transport links. I hope that hon. Members who are not familiar with this area will take note that there is no way to pass from Barrhead by road without going into either West Renfrewshire or Glasgow authority. That is how ridiculous these boundaries are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Martin, in view of the complications that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley mentions, do you not think that a site visit might be in order, so that members of the Committee can be fully acquainted with the details of this complex schedule before we make further progress on the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be a welcome initiative. I am willing to take my seat if the Minister is willing to recommend that the Committee is suspended to allow that. It would give the Minister an opportunity to visit Barrhead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that my hon. Friend be appointed as a guide, because quite obviously the Minister does not know the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that my hon. Friend also urges the Minister to drive between the two parts of Clackmannan and Falkirk, where there is no land corridor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is an artist with the pen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hexham earlier this evening gave me the valuable information that last weekend he bought a chicken in my constituency of Hamilton. Obviously, there is a pattern. I suggest that the hon. Member for Hexham should try next weekend to buy a turkey in Barrhead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to lose sight of the appalling figures produced in Ralston. In a referendum organised by the district council and supervised by the Electoral Reform Society, 67 per cent. of the people tookpart and 82 per cent. of them voted against becoming part of east Renfrewshire. That is meant to be the Minister's strongest area of support, but that will be proved wrong in the forthcoming by-election. If that is the best support
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
that he can get from those areas, perhaps he should review the whole map.<br><br>
The Minister made another interesting comment in the article in the <i>Eastwood Extra</i> to which I referred earlier. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The idea of East Renfrewshire has very strong suport."</p></blockquote>
From whom does it have strong support? I challenge the Minister to name anyone who does not live in Crofthead house or Neilston and who supports the notion of East Renfrewshire. I can tell him who does not: councillor Nancy Jackson, the former Conservative leader of Renfrew district council said in the <i>Paisley and Renfrewshire Gazette</i> of 7 October 1993 that she was surprised at the result of the ballot. No wonder—I bet the Minister was too. She says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Given that rents in Eastwood are lower, I thought that there might have been a different result. All the same, the Scottish Office will have to take notice of what people have said."</p></blockquote>
Councillor Ian Graham, the current leader of the Conservative group on Renfrew district council, in the leaflet that members of the Committee received today, endorses the paper put forward by the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must withdraw that allegation. It is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not withdraw my remark. Councillor Ian Graham has his photograph on a leaflet that has been circulated. If he is a councillor in Renfrew district council, he had better take up the matter with that council. The Minister should not tell us the position of Councillor Ian Graham. He has endorsed the leaflet and I adhere to that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He happens to be my councillor and I know his views. The hon. Gentleman must withdraw that allegation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I simply say that I must assume that the councillor supports that position as his photograph is on that leaflet. I simply say that his photograph is on that leaflet; that is a fact. I am glad to see hon. Members studying the leaflets that have been lying on the Benches all day. But it cannot be just one Tory councillor on Renfrewshire district council, because there was a unanimous vote in support of the position. That is a recorded vote in Renfrew district council.<br><br>
It cannot be Councillor Ian Pearce who, I believe, is an independent councillor in the Minister's constituency. I wonder whether the Minister would describe him as "one of my councillors". Councillor Pearce said that it was
<br><blockquote><p>"patently obvious that Eastwood was not large enough to stand on its own feet."</p></blockquote>
He also stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The two main thrusts were to keep Eastwood out of Glasgow—with which I agree—and to have a district which could stand on its own feet.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That could have included a move to return to a pre-1975 Renfrewshire".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
Those are the words of an independent councillor in the Minister's constituency.<br><br>
It cannot be Nielston community council that offers the Minister strong support. A letter from Mr. W. S. Reid, the chairman of that council, states that the
<br><blockquote><p>"Council have consistently opposed the proposal that Neilston should join with Eastwood as currently proposed by the Government. Our opposition is firmly based in the belief that local government should reflect both a historical basis as well as the everyday needs and desires of the population of an area. Neilston, and Barrhead, has since the reformation looked to Paisley as its administrative centre. This is further strengthened today with health, education, religious and other cultural services … emanating from Paisley."</p></blockquote>
The letter says that Neilston community council is the local government Minister's own community council and that the Minister
<br><blockquote><p>"has supported Luss Community Council by amending the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The letter asks for the Minister's support in leaving Neilston with Paisley, where it wants to be.<br><br>
It cannot be the chairman of Barrhead community council who supports the Minister. That chairman, Gilbert Baird—a well-known person in Barrhead—wrote to me to say that Barrhead community council jointly organised a public meeting with Neilston community council which was attended by hundreds of people. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the feeling of the meeting was overwhelmingly against the proposals.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In attendance were diverse groups representing, Tenants/Residents, Elderly, Disabled, Sports facility users, and Taxi drivers … no representative group in Barrhead, which has a population of over 25,000 people supported the Government's proposals. Local churches have also stated the proposals were unacceptable.</p></blockquote>
The letter further states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Barrhead Community Council supported the Renfrew District Council's Referendum, and were pleased with the result, 60 per cent. of the Electorate Voted, and 80 per cent. Voted No".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I may also refer to a comment made in the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I left the Room, the hon. Gentleman said that Councillor Ian Graham supported the idea of a single-tier Renfrew within existing boundaries. I have just telephoned the number here and the councillor has assured me that that is not his view. He is strongly behind the Bill's proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why did his picture appear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister should know better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I heard the hon. Member for Paisley, South state that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
the Minister was incorrect and that Councillor Ian Graham firmly believed in a single-tier Renfrew within its existing boundaries. Equally, I heard the Minister say that that was not true and he asked the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his remarks. I have since confirmed that what my hon. Friend the Minister said is correct. The hon. Member for Paisley, South must withdraw his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for the hon. Member for Paisley, South to withdraw his remarks. Hon. Members are entitled to express their views. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. The hon. Member for Paisley, South was not making anything up, he was expressing an opinion. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside and the Minister may be unhappy with that opinion, but the hon. Member for Paisley, South need not withdraw it. He has expressed his opinion and continued the debate. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside and the Minister have an opportunity to rebut what was said. Those are the rules of debate in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It stands as a fact that Councillor Ian Graham's photograph is on the leaflet. If he has a problem with that, he should sort it out with the council of which he is a member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it would help the Committee if it took time to read the leaflet. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For further information about local issues, boundaries, community and party views, the following members of the Council can be contacted:—".</p></blockquote>
Nothing could be clearer than that. It tells me and anyone else who understands how councils operate that Scottish Nationalists, Conservatives and Liberals should telephone their respective leaders on the council. If the hon. Gentlemen were to draw the Committee's attention to what the leaflet states, our proceedings would not be so acrimonious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The top of the page is headed "Renfrew District Council's view". I do not want to get bogged down by this nonsense. I have had it checked—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a great deal of noise from hon. Members who are seated. Only one person should be speaking. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. I ruled on whether the hon. Member for Paisley, South should withdraw his remarks and about what hon. Members can say. I made it clear that they can express opinions. In interventions, other hon. Members have rebutted what the hon. Member for Paisley, South said, so the record has been put straight on both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am sure that you will recall an earlier point of order when you and your co-Chairman made it clear that hon. Members should not make adverse comments about the integrity of other hon. Members. That wraps up what was said. The question here is not whether Councillor Graham said something, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
whether any member of the Committee has suggested that the Minister or the hon. Member for Paisley, South have cast aspersions. I do not think that they have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a Division in the House. It is possible that there will be two Divisions, so I shall suspend the sitting for 15 minutes on each.</span></p>
<p>10.28 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.58 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had got as far as saying that, contrary to the Minister's claims, many organisations in the vicinity of Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor, Ralston and West Dykebar do not support him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is widely respected. He has doubtless had time to reflect on the position in relation to Councillor Ian Graham's photograph on the leaflet from Renfrew district council. He might want to take this opportunity to clarify the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that Councillor Graham's photograph was in a leaflet. That is an unalterable fact. I have since had the chance to consult Councillor Owen Taylor, the leader of Renfrew district council, and Councillor Paul Mark, the deputy convenor of policy and resources; I know that they both hold Councillor Graham in some regard. They told me that Councillor Graham was consulted about the production of that leaflet. At no time during the deliberations of Renfrew district council has the Conservative group moved against the unanimous decisions—decisions that have been supported by the council—on that position. If the Minister is saying that he has more up-to-date information, I shall accept that.</span></p>
<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it was a unanimous decision, which included the decision of Councillor Graham, to support Renfrew district's present boundary? He voted for that and that cannot be gainsaid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my belief and I have heard nobody dispute that fact. I should rather move off that point.<br><br>
There is a long list of people who are close to what is happening in Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor and Ralston and who vigorously oppose these plans. Yet, as I said earlier, the Minister says that he has strong support for the east Renfrewshire boundaries.<br><br>
As well as the list that I have given, there is Councillor Nancy Jackson, who was the leader of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
Conservative group of Renfrew district council. I have heard no points of order about her position, to which I referred. No Tory in Renfrew district council has participated in a vote against this position, as the hon. Member for Angus East confirmed. Councillor Ian Pierce, an independent councillor of Eastwood, Barrhead community council, Neilston community council and both Paisley presbytery and the diocese of Paisley, have expressed their concerns. Indeed, as I said earlier, Neilson parish church, which is the Minister's own kirk, has been part of Paisley's presbytery since the Reformation. The last lot of Stuarts did not manage to change that. They were very proud of their connections with Renfrew, as are people of Barrhead.<br><br>
It is certainly not the people of Barrhead, Neilson and Uplawmoor who want to have any truck with the Minister's ideas about local government reform. In the same referendum, to which I have referred twice before, 57 per cent. of the people participated in the ballot, which is far higher than the average local government election turnout, and 78.5 per cent. of them voted against the Government's proposal. There are people involved in the gerrymandered proposals, whoever has gerrymandered them. I shall ask the Minister the same question that I asked him earlier. I told him whose support he does not have: will he intervene and tell me whose certain support he does have? Which local organisations and individuals elected to positions of responsibility in the area support him? I have searched extensively and have been unable to find anybody.<br><br>
It appears that not even Eastwood district council supports him. It employed Touche Ross and Co. to prepare a submission to the Scottish Office, in which it placed great emphasis on the lack of connection with Renfrew district. The report was prepared before the Bill was published, but after the White Paper was published.<br><br>
People know what the boundaries are all about. If members of the Committee do not, I refer them to my earlier point. The Minister said, in the <i>Evening Times</i> on 10 February, that we should not be surprised that, when Eastwood Conservative Association supports the principles of the Bill, it expects him to apply the principles to the Conservative advantage.<br><br>
We have had well-rehearsed arguments about the size of authorities. The Opposition have shown broad although not total agreement that they must be large enough to deliver cost efficiency and specialist services, including those to disabled people that cannot easily be delivered in small areas. They should be large enough to have a strong voice, to be effective and to be involved in matters such as strategic planning.<br><br>
The Committee has also heard about the anxiety of teachers, parents and pupils about the catchment areas of schools, and not only Roman Catholic schools. All these issues point to the fact that local authorities need to be large enough to be effective.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
Renfrew district council, which has a population of 201,000, has argued powerfully that it is large enough. As a former leader I obviously know it rather well. As I said earlier, not only am I a former leader but a former employee. I was an apprentice gardener so I know it from both sides. Its arguments are easy to understand. The problem is that Renfrew is the meat in the sandwich between Inverclyde and East Renfrewshire. The people whom the Minister wants to include in East Renfrewshire tell us clearly that they want no part of that. That is why we tabled amendment No. 37 for an all-Renfrew council. That would meet all the criteria that I have mentioned. It would be large, effective, cost-efficient and strong, and it would also allow a smooth transition because it is a local government unit within the terms of Strathclyde regional council. The district authorities in that area work well together.<br><br>
If the amendment fails or if the Minister accepts amendment No. 71 as proposed by the hon. Member for Ayr, we shall say to the Minister, "Stop the kidology". If the Minister wants, let him take Eastwood and go. The people in Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor, Ralston and West Dykebar have been used for just one purpose—to boost the numbers in East Renfrewshire to make it a bit less embarrassing for the Minister. If he believes that an authority the size of East Renfrewshire can work, let him go the whole hog, because by that same logic an authority the size of Eastwood district council should work too. I do not think that it can, but if that is what the Minister wants let us not use the people of Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor, Ralston and West Dykebar as pawns in that political game. They have made their views very clear; they do not want any part in this East Renfrewshire authority.<br><br>
I conclude with a more general point and a quote from a leader in <i>The Sunday Times Scotland.</i> I do not know who the leader writer is; it used to be the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Malone) and perhaps it still is. I do not know what the Minister's relationship is with central office because the leader says:
<br><blockquote><p>"There has been bitter feuding over the new boundaries. Some are plain daft.…Allan Stewart, the industry minister has so far had a free run preserving the Tory republic of Eastwood. The time has come to point out that a serious restructuring of local government should not pander to the prejudices of one MP."</p></blockquote>
Twenty five thousand people will be affected by the boundary change and they tell the Minister that their 25,000 wishes are more important than his one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In a brilliant speech my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) said that the schedule before the Committee is in important respects inaccurate. It refers twice to the A727. That road no longer exists; it should be the B767. It also refers to 14 houses in the general area of east and west Renfrewshire that are not included in any local authority boundaries. Those are serious errors in the descriptions of the two authorities in the schedule. The Committee should not consider the schedule
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
until the errors are corrected by way of Government amendments. As there are no Government amendments before the Committee, consideration of this part of the schedule should be postponed until an accurate description of the area concerned is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. The hon. Member has made certain claims and it is for the Minister to reply. It is not for me to deal with the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask two careful questions? Hon. Members may recall that the Wheatley commission considered whether Barrhead should be part of Eastwood. Miss Betty Harvie Anderson, the then local Member, and a member of the commission, argued strongly that Eastwood as currently delineated was the proper community of interest and that Barrhead and Neilston looked to Paisley and should be part of Renfrew district. I should first like to ask what has changed since Miss Betty Harvie Anderson—who used often to take the Chair that you occupy, Mr. Martin—formed that opinion?<br><br>
Secondly, I was the other day the guest of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde and the Linwood Labour party. They said that they knew of no local organisation that supported the Government's proposal. Will the Minister give us the name of any organisation that supports the proposal? Those of us who are not local to the area concerned are entitled to ask that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This market day is very late, but clearly the hon. Member for Paisley, South is still wide awake and energetic in defence of his constituency. We are discussing important matters. If the Minister is looking for rock-solid racing certainties as unitary authorities, he has them before him in the amendments. I hope that if the Minister's decision-making logjam has now been cleared, he will make an announcement to that effect before the debate is over.<br><br>
I support the points that have been made about Inverclyde and I note that the Inverclyde authority is supported by 38,000 people—a level of support that is by any standards extremely impressive. More than half its electorate signed a petition in favour of retaining decision-making powers in Inverclyde council, as a unitary authority. Greenock chamber of commerce, community councils and local branches of all the political parties have expressed support for that.<br><br>
The size of the district and the existing administrative facilities are suited to the purpose. It makes sense for Inverclyde to be a unitary authority.<br><br>
Similar reasoning also applies to Renfrew, the subject of my amendment, No. 118. Renfrew is well established and well fitted to unitary status. It is the fourth largest local authority in Scotland. It has plentiful resources with which to provide services at all levels, and at a point closer to the consumers.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0214">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
Renfrew could be a good example of the advantages to be gained from the provision of all services to residents by a unitary authority.<br><br>
By any standards Renfrew is well qualified to be such an authority. It has a population of 200,000. The district is in many ways of ideal size for an all-purpose authority. It cannot be considered too small. It has the necessary resources and a suitable population base. It can well perform the allocated tasks. There are strong local loyalties and the area has a clear identity and history, as we heard earlier. The local authority is long-established and clearly identified; it contains elements that stretch back over centuries of Scottish local government history.<br><br>
The council provides high-quality services. Its consumer satisfaction survey in March 1991 revealed great consumer satisfaction. That may well be carried into its performance as a unitary authority if the Minister so decides. It has excellent joint working consultations with community groups such as parents associations and special interest groups in the district, which reflect the council's practice of providing local government services close to the community.<br><br>
The Minister said that he wanted to achieve decentralisation but it already exists in Renfrew district council. As a unitary authority, it would be continued and strengthened to provide a range of services to its residents.<br><br>
I draw the Minister's attention to the attitude of Renfrew residents to their council. There were 2,322 replies to the 1991 consumer satisfaction survey—a response rate of 54 per cent., which is exceptionally high. The responses showed that Renfrew compares favourably with other authorities in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Residents appear very satisfied with their council's services compared with others.<br><br>
Overall, 62 per cent. of Renfrew residents are satisfied with district council services, compared with an average of 57 per cent. nationaly. Similarly, residents in Renfrew district expressed greater satisfaction with council services than their counterparts elsewhere. The council offers a high quality of service to consumers. As a unitary authority, that quality would apply to the range of services.<br><br>
Renfrew meets the test of consumer satisfaction. The opinion poll showed overwhelming opposition to the Government's proposal and massive support for Renfrew as a unitary authority. Renfrew contains some of Scotland's oldest local authorities. There is no problem about the community's identification with its local authority.<br><br>
On transport, employment, the provision of services and community links, Renfrew passes every test. An authority the size of Renfrew district, with its population of nearly 200,000, is large enough to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
provide a complete range of services through sound finance and high efficiency—if it is allowed to do so. The ball rests firmly in the Minister's court. However, if the logjam is broken because of previous decisions, I hope that he will take note of our representations on public opinion, on the high quality of services offered by Renfrew and Inverclyde and on their absolute suitability to be unitary authorities.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will listen to all those arguments and allow Renfrew and Inverclyde to have unitary authority status. If the Minister agrees, he will have added greatly to the assets of Scottish local government. The two authorities will make excellent unitary authorities and I hope that the Minister will take that decision tonight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister conceded some of the cases that we considered in terms of geographical boundaries. We are on the point of balance in this group of amendments.<br><br>
I am happy to support amendment No. 71, tabled by the hon. Member for Ayr. The Committee must recognise that Inverclyde district has a population of approximately 94,000. That is higher than the population of north-east Fife, which we discussed earlier. The 20-member council, which consists of 11 Labour councillors, eight Liberal Democrat councillors and one Conservative councillor, is unanimously opposed to the Government's proposals. It organised a high-profile campaign, which was called "Insist on Inverclyde". The Minister knows something about that campaign.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has been presented with a petition containing 30,000 signatures. I am sure that the Minister will concede that he held an interesting meeting with the sitting Member of Parliament, who led a delegation to see him. A written response setting out the council's views on the Government's position was delivered to the Minister. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the sitting Member of Parliament, as well as members of the Inverclyde district council supported the argument.<br><br>
Inverclyde is situated in the former burghs of Greenock, Gourock and Port Glasgow. It has no historical or current community ties with the rest of Renfrewshire. Historically, the majority of local government functions have been discharged by Inverclyde district or the three former burghs. The local population has little affinity with Strathclyde region as a unit of local government; it has even less affinity with the Renfrewshire sub-region.<br><br>
The Government propose the creation of a West Renfrewshire council, which would be based in Paisley. That would give Inverclyde the most remote local government in its history. Elsewhere in the Bill, the Government try to avoid similar circumstances. The Committee should consider Inverclyde's geographical position. Few savings will be made by merging it with Renfrew district. The current buildings would need to be retained to maintain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
services for which a need would continue to exist. There would still be a need for separate equipment for ground maintenance and refuse collection in Inverclyde.<br><br>
Inverclyde district has a good financial and efficiency record in discharging its existing functions. It has always met budgetary targets, and its size lends itself to efficiency and competitive tendering. It has always been prepared to keep to performance standard indicators and to justify itself to the electorate.<br><br>
An Inverclyde council could deliver the existing regional services. It already has a social work department, a roads department and an effective schools base on which to build. It has played a prominent role in industrial development and was instrumental in gaining enterprise zone status after the closure of the shipyards. We have a good case, which the Government should consider. An Inverclyde council could pass the Government's tests and meet the criteria that they have outlined in previous debates. I support the case that the hon. Member for Ayr presented. Inverclyde should be a free-standing entity. I commend the hon. Member for Paisley, South on his excellent speech. He spoke with passion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech was well researched.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree. I have rarely heard a speech that was delivered with such conviction in the interests of an electorate.<br><br>
Barrhead, Uplawmoor, Neilston and Ralston deserve special consideration. Earlier, I said that small communities such as Kincardine deserve special protection. Large district and regional councils have the resources to make their case effectively. Anyone who knows anything about that part of the country knows the direct link that Barrhead has with Paisley. I spent some time at the Paisley college of technology, and I used to drive daily through Barrhead to get there.<br><br>
There is a powerful case for treating Barrhead and Ralston in the way recommended by the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster). I do not need to reiterate what was said because the hon. Gentleman made the case so well. However, I do not want the Committee to think that, because I am saying only a few short words about it, I do not think it important. It is a very important matter and I hope that the Minister will consider the hon. Gentleman's remarks carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak on the educational implications of the proposals, because I want to be particularly clear about what is being suggested for Eastwood or for East Renfrew, and how it will impact upon existing educational provision. In particular, I want to seek clarification from the Minister about how the new scheme will tie in with the Eastwood
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
principle. I have a letter which the Minister sent to the director of education at Strathclyde regional council, dated 20 November 1992. The Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Eastwood principle—that pupils within Eastwood should be educated there—would be broken in a most disruptive way."</p></blockquote>
That is in the context of a proposed reorganisation.
<br><blockquote><p>"Further, the government is proposing to bring in unitary authorities instead of the present two-tier system. Although no decisions have been made, the Glasgow/Eastwood boundary is preserved under 3 of the 4 illustrative maps. If that boundary is breached now it could well then be reinstated in the new structure leading to a long period of disruption for the pupils involved."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is clearly saying that he intends to press for a hermetically sealed boundary, as it were, round the new East Renfrew. That has implications for a number of schools.<br><br>
I come first to the question of St. Ninian's. The Minister will be aware that when St. Ninian's was built, part of the condition of its construction was that we would have two Catholic primaries—St. Angela's and St. Louise's—in Glasgow attending the school. Given the rise in population, that school is likely to be overcrowded. I think that we are entitled to ask the Minister whether the Catholic youngsters in Pollock have any future under a new system of education, as proposed by the Government. It seems quite clear that under the Eastwood principle the Minister is saying that those youngsters should be removed from St. Ninian's secondary school.<br><br>
I also want to ask the Minister, if the Eastwood principle applies, what the implications are for youngsters in Ralston. Clearly, under the Eastwood principle, the East Renfrewshire youngsters should be educated in East Renfrewshire. The primary school youngsters attending Paisley grammar will presumably need to be educated withing East Renfrew. The nearest secondary school for them will be Barrhead. I presume, therefore, that the Minister is saying that in future he wishes non-denominational youngsters in Ralston to travel to Barrhead. The Eastwood principle would also apply to West Renfrew, so West Renfrew youngsters would be educated in West Renfrew. They would have first priority for all the places that were available at Paisley grammar.<br><br>
That is the logic of the Minister's position, and of the Government's position to date. It would mean that there would be no secondary places available at Paisley grammar for these youngsters who would, under the Minister's stipulation, be required to attend Barrhead.<br><br>
If that is true I hope that the hon. Gentleman will spell it out to people in the Ralston area when they vote in the by-election on 17 March. The Tory councillor there, George Farquarson, recently resigned. He has claimed credit, as I understand it, for helping to advise the Minister to take Ralston into East Renfrewshire. I hope that the Minister will give us an undertaking that he will be prepared to listen to the voters in that area and be advised by the decisive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
result that I expect from the by-election. I hope that the Minister will give a clear indication that he will listen to what people in Ralston have to say through the ballot box, because the result will be with us before the Committee has completed its deliberations.<br><br>
I understand that on Thursday we are likely to have a petition from every house in Ralston—some 1,700 names or so. It was intended that it would be here in time to help illuminate our debate. I understand that the lady involved cannot be with us tonight. The petition will be here on Thursday. I hope that Ministers will take account of that.<br><br>
11.30 pm<br><br>
I seek clarification on the position of Ralston Roman Catholic children. Under the Eastwood principle they would no longer be able to attend St. John Ogilvie primary school in Paisley. The nearest Catholic primary school in those circumstances would be St. John's or St. Mary's in Barrhead.<br><br>
Similarly the Ralston Roman Catholic secondary school children would presumably no longer attend St. Andrew's academy and would therefore attend St. Luke's in Barrhead.<br><br>
The Minister has a responsibility, as he is the local Member of Parliament, and as he has enunciated the Eastwood principle of Eastwood children being educated within Eastwood—hermetically-sealed borders, applying similarly to East Renfrew—to make it clear to us what will happen to those children. It is causing a great deal of anxiety to all the parents involved. I hope that he will make a clear statement before the end of the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall first respond to the general point about Inverclyde made by several hon. Members. It relates to amendment No. 37, which would create a single Renfrewshire authority. The hon. Member for Paisley, South made rather a long speech for a Whip—it is unusual for Whips serving on Committees to say anything other than "I beg to move that this Committee do now adjourn". In his speech he did not say much about amendment No. 37, however.<br><br>
I can find no evidence from any council or any other significant group anywhere in Renfrewshire in support of this view. As the hon. Member for Linlithgow said, that is not the view of Inverclyde. That is not the view of Renfrew district and hon. Members have received leaflets from Renfrew district. It is certainly not the view in Eastwood district. Throughout the consultation process no representations—except from a handful of individuals—have been made to the Scottish Office strongly in favour of a single-tier Renfrewshire—unlike other areas, such as Ayrshire, where there have been representations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to my hon. Friend that there have not been many representations because some Opposition Members seem more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
interested in England. One Labour Member on the Committee is asking the Secretary of State for the Environment tomorrow what submissions he has received on local government boundaries for Somerset and Dorset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. What is happening tomorrow on the Floor of the House has nothing to do with this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point that there appears to be no support for the Opposition's proposal for a single-tier Renfrewshire. We have received no signs of any support for it, and submissions received by hon. Members have contained no such support.<br><br>
The fallback position of the Labour party is that East Renfrewshire would comprise Eastwood district and that West Renfrewshire would comprise Renfrew and Inverclyde. That is not the position of Renfrew or Inverclyde districts. If Opposition Members are saying that we should have an Eastwood district within its existing boundaries as a single-tier authority, the Government can hardly be accused of creating Tory—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I inform the Minister, although he should know already, that the following responses were received from the Renfrew district to "Shaping the Future—The New Councils": J. McQueen, a Renfrew resident; D. Hall, a Howard resident; A. Armstrong, a former resident; D. Reid, a Lochwinnoch resident, and M. Murray, a Johnstone resident. Reponses were also received from Barrhead community council, Lochwinnoch community council, Kilbarton civic society, Ralston community council, Renfrewshire Enterprise, and M. Pollock, an Uplawmoor resident. Those responses supported either a Renfrew county or a Renfrew-Inverclyde option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but they do not support the single-tier Renfrew option, which is the only option being advanced by the Labour party. Only six representations were received putting forward that point of view. [Hon. Members: "Wrong again."] No, that much is absolutely clear. Nor has this Committee since then heard from any person or council the proposition that there should be a single-tier Renfrewshire.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr made an excellent speech. It was supported by the hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and for Angus, East. The hon. Member for Linlithgow made a short speech in connection with Inverclyde. Hon. Members are right to say that I received a delegation from the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow; it argued for a single-tier Inverclyde unitary authority. I am happy to tell the Committee that I agree with that proposal and am disposed to accept the amendment relating to Inverclyde and tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, supported by Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister refer to the criticism from my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
Paisley, South about the wording of the schedule? Will he confirm that the schedule is inaccurate when it refers to the A727, and that it omits 14 houses in the area from any local authority boundary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall check the question about the road. However, by definition, the houses cannot have been omitted. West Renfrewshire is described as including Inverclyde district council and Renfrew district council, except for those areas that belong to East Renfrewshire. Thus, if the mysterious 14 houses have been missed out of East Renfrewshire, by definition they would belong to West Renfrewshire.<br><br>
A more general point is that the boundaries were drawn up by the Ordnance Survey, at the Government's request. The hon. Member for Paisley, South was amusing about the Ralston boundary, but I have two points to make. First, the hon. Member for Dundee, East was correct in his reference to the person who suggested the inclusion of Ralston. That person was the well respected Councillor Farquarson, who has served the area for many years. The boundary in question has been established for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister has just made it clear that he cannot confirm the accuracy of the schedule's wording. He said that he would have to check the situation with the A727. That was an admission that he could not guarantee that the schedule's reference to that road is correct. That being so, the Committee cannot know whether it is dealing with a correct description of the proposed council, so we cannot consider the amendment any further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made a serious point. He must understand that,the Committee and I are in the hands of the House, which has put before us the Bill. We must consider, and can amend, the Bill that the House passes to us. Other remedies may be available to the hon. Member, but that is my ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I turn now to the points made by the hon. Member for Paisley, South—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister deals with the detailed issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South, I want to make an important point. I understand that he has accepted amendment No. 71, which was moved by the hon. Member for Ayr and deals with Inverclyde. It is interesting to put on record that the Minister is beginning to accept small authorities in areas where arrangements have been made to provide redoubts for the Conservative party—Kyle and Carrick in Ayrshire, Eastwood in Renfrewshire and Stirling in Central. In other areas, where there has been no gerrymandering, the Minister is prepared to see reason and accept large authorities that can provide services. Those of us who live in, work in and represent the areas in which the little Tory heartlands have been created must suffer the small authorities. Is not that an interesting pattern to emerge?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the hon. Gentleman that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend is aware that my constituency includes a large part of the new authority of Perthshire and Kinross. One would hardly describe it or Angus, which is the other part of my constituency, as a small authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is right. I hope that we can ensure, by one means or another, that the remarks of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley will be distributed throughout Inverclyde. The view that he expressed is not the one that emerged from representations or from the petition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the Opposition's amendment that would create an all-Renfrewshire authority. During my speech, I made it clear that if that amendment fell, there was a three-council solution. We would want Barrhead, Neilston, Uplawmoor, Ralston and West Dykebar to be included in the West Renfrewshire authority or in the Renfrew district authority rather than in the East Renfrewshire authority. Before the Minister concludes, will he let us know his position on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable request; I was about to do just that. The remarks of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley about Inverclyde will be resented widely because that delegation made a reasonable case for being a unitary authority. The authority is a Labour authority and the all-party delegation was led by one of his hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the intervention of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. Just as one of his hon. friends was a prime mover in the case for Inverclyde, his hon. Friends are the prime movers in pushing for Cunninghame to step aside from Ayrshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; he is, of course, correct. The argument of the hon. Member for Paisley, South about east Renfrewshire and Eastwood is surprising. The hon. Gentleman is accusing the Government—I use the term advisedly—of gerrymandering, and hon. Members have talked about the creation of safe Tory havens. If we accepted the Opposition's proposals for an Eastwood district, we would be creating an authority that had only one Labour councillor, one Liberal Democrat councillor and two independent councillors. The others would all be Conservative councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman. I have been generous in giving way to members of the Committee. If we had wanted to create a Tory safe haven, Eastwood would be it.<br><br>

11.45 pm<br><br>
Opposition Members, after all their criticism, are putting forward a proposal that would create a Tory safe haven rather than a proposal for a much more balanced authority, which would be the result of the East Renfrewshire authority. It would have a well balanced housing stock and a good industrial area that would balance the largely surburban and service area in Eastwood district. That is the position. Reference has been made in Neilston to Councillor Ian Graham. It is clearly his position, too, as it is that of one Barrhead councillor—although not the Labour councillors, I accept that. The more specific suggestion about Ralston was proposed to the Government by a long established councillor for that area. I, therefore, cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment.<br><br>
As for the referendum, some of the pamphlets that were circulated during that time were disgraceful. It was alleged that if voters ended up in the East Renfrewshire authority, their water would be privatised, while if they were under the West Renfrewshire authority, it would not. Has anyone ever heard such nonsense? It was suggested that sports centres would be either privatised or closed in their entirety. No wonder people were worried and voted in a particular way.<br><br>
In conclusion, I recommend the Committee to accept the Inverclyde option. I cannot, however, accept the other amendments proposed by hon. Gentlemen.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. When there was earlier discussion about councillor Ian Graham during an intervention in my speech, we came to an understanding of the position. Will the Minister take this opportunity to be as gracious and apologise for his remarks on television last week about the leader of Renfrew district council—Owen Taylor? The Minister said that Mr. Taylor was advancing the case in favour of Barrhead council—as he has been doing well and strongly—because he was protecting his own position as leader of the council. That was a disgraceful remark. Anyone who knows councillor Taylor knows that not to be so. Perhaps the Minister has been misreported and he may want the chance to put the record straight. Many hon. Members were offended by those remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point of order is similar to one made against the hon. Gentleman in an earlier debate. Such matters are not for the Chair.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In the light of the amazing decisions that we have made about boundaries, would you reconsider the possibility of our having a debate on amendmends Nos. 67 and 68? If we are to have lines drawn through Ben Wivis drive and other places, we might as well have Crofthead house as East Renfrewshire or West Renfrewshire detached, and move the Minister to one or the other. That would be as daft as are the boundary divisions that we have just agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are already to discuss the schedule.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the first schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be called to speak in this debate, Mr. Martin. I do not intend to detain the Committee for long at this late hour. We have every intention of making progress on a substantial Bill, but we have another 68 clauses and 13 schedules to deal with. However, we need to say a few words about this crucial schedule now that we begin to see a design and pattern developing. At least we can come to prelimimary conclusions about what is going on.<br><br>
What started as a 28-council set up for Scotland is now a 31-council solution after two days of debate in the Committee. On top of that, there is the possibility of East Lothian and Midlothian being considered as separate unitary authorities. The question of the Central Region for Scotland being of a different configuration from what is set out in the Bill remains open. In the Minister's words, there is still a half-open mind on the question of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth being part of north Lanarkshire and there may be further consideration of the position of Renfrewshire.<br><br>
12 midnight<br><br>
We have now added incoherence to the gerrymandering and the high, inescapable cost of the original plans. Uncertainty and imprecision have been added to the incoherence of the proceedings of the Bill thus far. That is no service to local government or local democracy in Scotland. The mess that is developing will be noted and registered throughout Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Is he saying that, because the Committee has made changes that several of his colleagues wanted, that is to be regarded as gerrymandering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not accusing the Committee of gerrymandering. We cannot accuse the Minister, but we can accuse other Ministers of gerrymandering and they are up to their eyes in that. If the hon. Gentleman would listen for a moment, I am saying that a picture of the future of Scottish local government is emerging. After all, we have been considering the principal schedule to a Bill that will draw the boundaries of Scottish local government in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
the future, and it is a picture of incoherence. It does not follow logically either the consultative document or the Government's White Paper, but a pattern is developing, based on the accidents of amendments that were tabled by hon. Members who happened to meet a few councillors in a corridor. There is also the whim of a Minister who says that he occasionally listens to people before he comes here with preordained scripts, and thereafter.<br><br>
The result will be a continuing dog fight between districts in Scotland, some Labour-controlled, others controlled by other parties. They will continue the fight for unitary status on Report and in the Lords. That new uncertainty will be of no assistance to people in Scotland.<br><br>
Ever smaller authorities are being created in Scotland, most of which will not be able to deliver the full range of services that are necessary. Large authorities deemed to be permanently in the hands of the Opposition will be left, and the Government will claim that they will balance the large city authorities that the Government created at the beginning of the process.<br><br>
That does a gross disservice to local democracy and it will result in the almost certain product of a system of local government in Scotland that will not sustain services, which will lack stability and which will not survive in future. That is not in the interests of the Scottish people—so I wonder what the Government are up to.<br><br>
What is the policy? Is it that determined in the White Paper, with its logic of consultation? Is it included in the White Paper, which had its own illogical follow-on from the consultation process? An incoherent view seems to emanate from the hon. Member for Ayr bumping into people in the Corridor and selling packages to the Minister. People deserve to know. We are 14 months away from the first elections to those shadow authorities. It is an impossibly tight timetable in which to establish a whole new structure for local government in Scotland. There has been no review nor any attempt to gain consensus in Scotland. Boundaries are far from having been determined—they are likely to be moved at the Government's whim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that I keep bumping into people in the Corridor. Will he acknowledge that most of those whom I have bumped into have been of his political persuasion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of the people have been of my political persuasion, and I have been critical of them for utilising the services of the hon. Member for Ayr. I do not know who he will bump into tomorrow or on Thursday, nor what amendments will emanate from that or what new uncertainty will be imposed on the Scottish local government system as a consequence of the random bumping into people in which the hon. Member for Ayr indulges.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
The Opposition are not trying to redraw the map for Scottish local government. We could have tabled mutliple amendments that would have given us a random choice. Like a pinball game, we could all have determined our best efforts in drawing the Scottish local government map. That could have given us six months of useful deliberation and entertaining debates. The parliamentary timetable does not allow that and we know the timetable that the Government have allowed for the shadow elections.<br><br>
We have limited ourselves to trying to rectify some of the gross mistakes that the Government have made in the map. The five sittings of the Committee have added incoherence to the gerrymandered, high-cost solution that the Government propose. This is not a system, like the one provided by the 1973 legislation, that would survive and be stable and productive for 20 years. This measure will not survive and it does not deserve to do so. It is a mess because the Government have rushed into it without a proper review or proper consideration. The people of Scotland will be the worse off for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the unease felt by the hon. Member for Hamilton. I must be careful because some of my ideas have been accepted by the Government. I acknowledge that and I am deeply grateful to the Minister for his generous concessions. However, that does not detract from the point made by the hon. Member for Hamilton. I, too, am puzzled about how the Government have approached this part of the Bill. I should have been happier if the Government had tabled their own amendments and had tried to present a coherent picture. I shall not go over the ground that the hon. Member for Hamilton has covered, but I understand his position perfectly and the unease that he feels.<br><br>
I cannot understand the differences between Inverclyde, Dunfermline and East Lothian. One is treated one way; the East Lothian question is still unresolved; and Dunfermline got the kibosh. I cannot see how the people in those areas will reconcile those three separate Government decisions with such similar situations. It is difficult to get an answer to that question. To that extent, I share the unease of the hon. Member for Hamilton, although I am more reconciled to some of the Committee's detailed decisions. I hope that the Minister will reflect on those important questions. Consequences will flow from those decisions and the arguments will continue and may be exacerbated in the near future.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister accepts, from me if from no one else, that the situation in Highland region should be dealt with later in the Bill's passage through Parliament because no Members of Parliament representing Highland seats, are members of the Committee. Rather than representations being made to the Committee indirectly, it was decided to leave those questions until Report. The Minister should acknowledge the differences of opinion in Highland region. If no reference is made to those arguments, it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
is not because they do not exist, but because the Committee stage is not the best forum. Those Members of Parliament most directly involved have no direct access. I hope that the Minister will assist the process by allowing sensible discussions later in the Bill's passage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I still feel uneasy about how we are proceeding to create boundaries that will determine the future of Scottish local government. This is probably the worst way to create boundaries, with the ricochets and the lottery of amendments. I would rather have seen the slow, methodical, well-researched approach, which would have been the result of a commission. Instead we have probably the worst and most informal approach. We are dealing with a fundamental matter, which will greatly affect local authorities and, in many ways, determine their future success or failue.<br><br>
Our debates seem to have been a series of stops, starts and go-slows, mostly starring the map-makers from Ayr. I have found the various Government attitudes rather puzzling. They go from stonewalling, through creating new councils, to vagueness and delay. That map-making lottery is an insult to the local government system. We should be more serious in our approach. Even after our debates, fundamental questions remain unanswered. When will the missing boundaries be drawn? Where will they be? We shall go on to discuss services and other aspects of local government without knowing the fundamental building blocks within which those services will take place. Questions remain unanswered about information technology costs and the missing £40 million. Where boundaries cut through school catchment areas, catholic schools in particular and schools in general may find themselves on the wrong side of the boundaries. Those questions have not been answered by the Government, despite the valiant efforts of the hon. Member for Govan.<br><br>
Fundamental questions remain about property transfers. We have not heard how the changes will affect employees and the buildings in which they work, or about local authority central services. I have great doubts about the size of the new Aberdeenshire. I would congratulate the Minister on his wisdom and justice regarding Kincardineshire, but the Aberdeenshire job is not yet finished. It is a very large authority and the Minister should not rule out reconsidering those boundaries.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for his courtesy and his willingness to listen. I look forward to a greater clarity in those matters that have not yet been decided but which are crucial to the Bill. The Committee's work will determine the future of local government in Scotland, but it will affect every person in the country. It is crucial that we get the system right. If not, the system will not last even the 20 years that the previous system survived. We are talking about delivering essential services to everyone in Scotland. We are considering the fundamental building blocks of our country's democracy, so the issues deserve to be treated seriously.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
Some unanswered questions remain. I hope that, before long, the Minister will get down to responding to them in a way that he has not done so far.</span></p>
<p>12.15am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one detailed point to make, with which I hope the Minister will deal, before I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton.<br><br>
The schedule is entitled "New Local Government Areas". It refers to the four cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the remaining authorities will be called councils. I suggest that if we are to lose districts and regions, we should give the new areas a name. What about calling them counties?<br><br>
My. hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has already made the substantive point. The Committee has made a bad schedule worse. It was irrational at the outset. It included outrageous examples, such as the proposed Berwickshire and East Lothian authority. I suppose that I should be thankful for small mercies because that proposal has gone. It was absurd.<br><br>
Now the schedule contains a range of authorities and even more smaller authorities. That creates considerable difficulties. My hon. Friend the Minister for Hamilton said that that would create uncertainty, and I fear that that is no accident. The Government want authorities to squabble among themselves so that they present contradictory representations to the Government. That suits their purposes. It is the old story of divide and rule.<br><br>
All the district councils in Scotland would love to be all-purpose authorities, whether or not they would be able to deliver services efficiently. I tried to approach the debates affecting my constituency as responsibly as possible. That involved getting into arguments with people in my constituency. Many people in my constituency would prefer a single-tier East Lothian. People in every district prefer a single-tier authority. However, I felt that in the context of local government reform we should aim for reasonable sized authorities. But what have we got? Inverclyde and the three Ayrshire authorities. Goodness knows what will happen to Clackmannan or how many more concessions will be made. I have been trying to hold the line, but if the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
want Mickey Mouse authorities all over Scotland that cannot provide quality service, we shall all have to review our positions. In these circumstances, even more small authorities may be created. That is not what we want, but the Government are opening the floodgates to that.<br><br>
The Committee has made a bad schedule worse. It is bad news for local government and for those who depend on local government services. This will not stand the test of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only change to the Bill on which there has been a Division has been that to Luss. By any standards, that is a relatively small boundary change. Every other change has been agreed without the Opposition dividing the Committee. That shows that the Government are responding positively to the points that have been made from both sides of the Committee. I confirm that all other changes to which we have agreed have been the result of cross-party representations. I am not defensive about having listened to such representations or for responding positively to them. That has been evidenced by the number of reasonable and reasoned changes that we have made to the schedule without a Division.</span></p>
