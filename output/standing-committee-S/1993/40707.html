	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. You, Mr. Hogg, are the very man to clear up a mystery for me and the Committee. Why are meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee like London buses: one waits for them for weeks and weeks and then they come along in bunches? We had one on Tuesday, we have one today and there is another next Tuesday. Would not it be better to separate them properly throughout the Session? Can something be done about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How the programme for meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee is determined is not a matter for me. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the Government have proposals for the Scottish Grand Committee that are to be put before the House shortly. We all look forward to hearing what the hon. Gentleman has to say about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered Class XIV, votes 7 and 8.</p></blockquote>
I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about housing in Scotland and to hear hon. Members' views on the many important issues involved. The Government have always placed a strong emphasis on pursuing a housing policy which seeks to offer the people of Scotland better housing in terms of choice, quality and value for money, and it gives me great satisfaction to see that this policy, pursued over the past 10 years, is making steady progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for beginning with home ownership. The reason is simple. It is what most people want. It is clear from repeated surveys that between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. of people want to own their own home. We have already made tremendous strides in enabling people to own their homes. When we came into office in 1979, only 35 per cent. of households owned their own homes. Now over 55 per cent. do so, and I believe that we are well on the way towards achieving our target of 60 per cent. That has mainly been achieved through the sale of over 284,000 public sector homes to tenants through the right to buy by the end of last year. That represents 27.6 per cent. of the total public sector stock as at 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I became a Minister we were 5 percentage points behind England on the percentage of public sector stock sold to sitting tenants. We are now ahead of England and the gap is widening all the time. Some 26.8 per cent. of the public sector stock has been sold to tenants in England and 27.6 per cent. is the figure in Scotland. That is significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the weight that the Minister appears to put on a survey in which 80 per cent. of people wished to own their own homes. The same 80 per cent. would probably also like a castle in Spain or a Rolls-Royce. If the Minister is talking about giving people real choice, why are the Government sticking doggedly to the dogma that Scottish Homes tenants cannot transfer their tenancy to local councils if they so wish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised that point yesterday and I made it quite clear that if special circumstances exist, local authorities will not necessarily be excluded. Those circumstances that I mentioned yesterday were the number of properties involved, allocation and the percentage of houses owned by the local authority. In the case of the hon. Gentleman's district council, 44 per cent. are in the public sector. Our aim is to achieve more diversity, an aim that would not necessarily be achieved by putting Kilmarnock and Loudoun district council on the ballot paper unless there were special circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly free to put the case to Scottish Homes in his area if there are, for example, remote areas or groups of houses where that would be more appropriate. He must argue his case with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to develop the point that I was making earlier. The hon. Gentlemen can come in later if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that since then sales have increased still further and we are now clearly ahead of England in terms of the proportion sold. I was greatly encouraged by the reported increase in applications to buy last year and the outlook for future years looks reasonably buoyant We thought that receipts, which benefit the public sector, would be in the region of £230 million last year; in fact, they were well ovér £250 million. That is to be spent on public sector stock, which is in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that the right-to-buy scheme may not suit everyone which is why we introduced the rent-to-mortgage scheme to provide an alternative route for people who wish to buy their homes. Approaching 1,000 people have taken advantage of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I have an undertaking from the Scottish Office that it will discuss with the Department of Social Security the complex problem about which I went to see Councillor Robert Lee and Mr. Mike Bruce, the chief executive of Weslo? Can Scottish Homes' successor authorities have the same powers of administration over benefit as was vested in Scottish Homes and, indeed, in the local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My impression is that the answer would be yes. I am prepared to look into the hon. Gentleman's point and shall follow it through with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
him. Weslo had problems with raising private finance and Scottish Homes, with the consent of the Treasury, made special arrangements which involved the deferred payment of all or part of the bid price. Efforts have been made to meet the circumstances of Weslo. I shall look into the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just develop my lines of argument? I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Promoting home ownership is also high on Scottish Homes' list of key objectives. Apart from promoting the right to buy for its tenants, its low cost home ownership programme provides a wide variety of opportunities for people who are not public sector tenants to own their own home. That programme includes shared ownership, improvement for sale and GRO grant-funded schemes. The benefits that these programmes can bring—last year Scottish Homes funded the provision of nearly 3,000 homes for sale—are now recognised on all sides. The particular success of the programme has been its role in taking owner-occupation into areas such as the peripheral estates where for years people would have regarded us as premature to think that home ownership markets could be established. They are a great success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that in places such as Denny, in my constituency, Scottish Homes is selling off its housing stock not to sitting tenants but, in certain cases, on the open market when low income families are on the housing waiting list whose only hope of getting a house is obtaining rented accommodation? How on earth can the Minister justify that? Will he have a word with Scottish Homes about the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look into the point that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. There is a portable discounts scheme—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not talking about that. I was talking about sales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman was not referring to that scheme. In certain cases, local authorities have nomination agreements with Scottish Homes. I will look into the particular point relating to Denny that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although home ownership is the clear preference for most people, choice means having more than one option which is why we see a continuing and important role for rented housing. The Government's commitment is clear from the substantial resources which have been allocated for investment in public rented housing: over £426 million has been made available this year to local authorities alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extending choice for tenants in the social rented sector is being provided increasingly by housing associations, which now provide most of new social housing for rent in Scotland. This year, Scottish Homes is channelling some £270 million into housing association development. In 1993–94 registered housing associations developed
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
more than 5,000 homes for rent. They are at the forefront of providing choice in areas where it has been most lacking, such as the large peripheral housing schemes surrounding our cities. In total, they provide around 70,000 homes, and I see them playing a continuing and important role in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another ingredient in improving choice is better information and advice. Scottish Homes is supporting a Scottish homelessness advisory service to be run jointly by Shelter Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland. Citizens advice bureaux will act as the primary agents in providing advice on housing and housing-related issues to the public, while Shelter will provide secondary support in terms of local information, specialised advice and training to the bureaux.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the housing association statistics, as I am a long-standing supporter of housing associations. However, I remind the Minister that at a seminar last year organised by the Ewing inquiry, he said that the Scottish Office objectives were to have fully 1 per cent. of total housing stock up to full wheelchair standard and about 10 per cent. to mobility standard. How near are we to attaining those targets, or are we as far away as we were 10 years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obviously extremely important that there should be good access for disabled people. In the plans that we support, all future buildings should be up to the required standard. This is an on-going matter, to which we will give priority. I will return to it in my winding-up speech and give a progress report on how quickly events are moving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just develop my remarks about Shelter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the valuable role played by organisations such as Shelter, especially in the provision of housing advice and in piloting projects such as care and repair, and have provided significant financial assistance over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the substantial funding which it is due to receive through Scottish Homes for the Scottish homelessness advisory service, we have provided direct assistance of almost £900,000 towards specific projects since 1987. That includes £94,000 this year to fund the Shelter housing law service. We see that as a valuable development which will not only improve the availability of expert legal advice, training and information on housing-related issues, but have a direct impact in helping to prevent homelessness, a subject to which I shall return later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has mentioned choice on a number of occasions in relation to Scottish Homes tenants. But is it not true that theirs is Hobson's choice? They are not allowed to become council tenants, and Scottish Homes will not continue as their landlord. Their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
only choice is to vote yes or no for a housing association set up by Scottish Homes staff. If they vote no, they are asked to vote again in a few months' time, and if the result is the same, they are asked to vote again until they say yes. That is no choice at all. Why cannot they be offered council ownership, continuing Scottish Homes ownership or the option of setting up co-operatives? Scottish Homes tenants are being offered Hobson's choice in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat what I said yesterday: ultimately, if a majority of tenants wish to remain in the public sector, they will have the opportunity of doing so. If, through the ballot paper, they vote no, they will remain with Scottish Homes. It is no secret that it is the purpose of the Scottish Office to increase the enabling role of Scottish Homes. The more voluntary disposals that Scottish Homes can have, the more funds it will have available to spend on necessary projects in co-operation with local authorities. As we know, more than 40 strategic agreements have been formed with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rural policy, we are well aware that parts of Scotland—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interrupting the Minister from a sedentary position is not appropriate, certainly not from the Opposition Front Bench. The Committee will appreciate that a lot of hon. Members wish to speak this morning. These interruptions merely extend the Minister's speech, and do not assist us in getting through our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Homes launched its rural policy in 1991 and the centrepiece was the creation of 10 rural demonstration areas to test new policy instruments in a wide variety of rural housing circumstances. The demonstration areas have recently been subject to independent evaluation and, while much remains to be done, they have generally been found successful. One of the most successful was the rural home ownership grant scheme, targeted at individuals to assist them in gaining access to owner occupation. I was pleased to announce earlier this year that Scottish Homes would be making the grants available throughout rural Scotland. Between 1991 and the current year expenditure increased from £42 million to over £60 million, an increase of 44 per cent., which confirms its commitment to improve housing conditions and choice throughout rural Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tackling homelessness remains a top priority for the Scottish Office. Homelessness is one of four key priorities which local authorities have been asked to cover in their housing strategies and output targets. Helping to reduce homelessness is also a priority for Scottish Homes. We have set it a target of securing the provision of 2,500 homes for homeless people this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision for homeless people is therefore given priority within the mainstream resources for housing investment. In addition, in 1991 to 1993 £27 million of extra capital allocations were made available to local housing authorities, for nearly 200 homelessness projects throughout Scotland. The Government have supported a number of special initiatives by voluntary groups. I have already mentioned the projects involving Shelter and
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Citizen's Advice Scotland. Another example is the £100,000 a year, for three years that we are providing for the Bridges project "One Door Initiative" in Edinburgh. This will show how a range of statutory and voluntary bodies can work together to help young, homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not complacent about homelessness. We issued a consultation paper on homelessness on 12 May because we wished to seek views from a wide range of interests on whether there were real problems with the present provision for homeless people and, if so, what should be done to help solve those problems. Today is the closing date for comments and I will be particularly interested in any points raised by members of the Committee. I can assure hon. Members that we will not bring forward proposals for changes in homelessness provisions until we have carefully reviewed the responses received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, we are determined to ensure that housing plays its full part in community care. Included within the total resources made available to authorities this year was an extra £10 million targeted on authorities which have developed special community care projects. In addition, Scottish Homes will spend over £82 million this year on community care; a record 2000 hew homes for special needs groups are planned. A draft circular on housing and community care was issued for comment in February. Over 80 responses have been received, mainly favourable, and the final circular should be issued this summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of housing is a concern which many Members share. The results of the first Scottish house condition survey were published last year. I shall not go over them again in detail, but they revealed a number of problems which must be addressed. We have already begun to take action on two problems—below tolerable standard housing and dampness and condensation—by making them national priorities for housing investment. Local authorities must therefore address these issues in preparing their housing strategies and targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much will also need to be done by private landlords and owner occupiers and I shall speak briefly about the improvement and repairs grant system. The Secretary of State announced last year that the effectiveness of the system was to be reviewed in the light of the house condition survey. At present, grant is mainly discretionary and in most cases takes no account of the owner's means. Between 1979 and 1993 £1.2 billion was spent and 370,000 grants approved. But it is essential to know whether help goes to those who need it most and whether they receive the right level of support
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A working group, including representatives of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and Scottish Homes, as well as independent members, was established to help to provide some answers. Its work is now complete and a report was recently presented to the Secretary of State with a number of recommendations. Our consideration of these must be set in the context of scarce public resources. We believe that they can best be used by targeting houses in the worst condition and those least able to afford the cost of works. This points towards a greater focus on below tolerable standard houses and those which are in severe disrepair and also to some test of personal resources so that grant is awarded on the basis of need. We intend to move towards a reform of the grant system on those lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the substantial resources invested in housing. We are also keen to encourage more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
private investment in housing because this will attract considerable extra funds. With the Scottish Homes development programme, for each £2 of public funds £1 or private finance is invested. The benefits of private investment are obvious. While continuing strong public sector support, our firm aim is to encourage even more private sector involvement in housing to enable public sector funds to go much further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give an example of the contribution that the private sector can make. Figures released recently showed that last year the number of homes built for sale by the private sector was nearly 18,000—the highest on record, and a substantial and direct benefit to housing in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned housing investment. He is aware that housing support grant in the past 14 years or so has declined to a residual level. In fact, the cumulative loss for the period is approximately £1,800 million. My question is simple. Where has that £1,800 million of lost housing investment gone? The various schemes of which the Minister reminded the Committee amount to nowhere near that sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have moved away from generalised subsidy and towards personalised subsidy for those who need it. Housing benefit in Scotland is about £700 million and of that about £600 million is spent on public sector tenants. Seven hundred million pounds is a substantial amount by any standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

A good practice note on the management of empty housing will be issued later this year following the report by Professor Alan Murie. Authorities have been asked to take steps to identify in their housing plans properties in their area, and consider action to bring them back into use, and, in their housing management plans, to deal with the management of empty properties. Scottish Homes has been active in tackling the problem, including the recent introduction of the lead tenancy scheme. This year we have agreed with Scottish Homes a target of bringing 500 empty homes back into use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urban regeneration in Scotland also demonstrates that genuine progress has been made and that greater choice is now possible. Almost 7,000 homes have been improved or renovated. Housing associations and co-operatives are providing greater choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I noted the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> He stated that far too much funding is going to Glasgow and not enough to Edinburgh. The figures that the hon. Gentleman used were misleading. The number of households in priority need is only one indicator of housing need and is not necessarily a guide for investment priorities. Glasgow has considerable housing needs: two factors are stock condition and the need to regenerate the peripheral estates. We are determined to achieve a fair allocation of resources throughout Scotland. When Scottish Homes was established, it inherited from the Housing Corporation a high level of investment in the inner city of Glasgow. That correctly reflected the needs of the 1970s and 1980s. Now, priority has switched to the peripheral estates but investment in other areas is growing. Since 1989–90, Scottish Homes' investment has increased by 60 per cent. in Edinburgh and by 24 per cent. in Glasgow. There has been a determined effort to achieve a fair allocation of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not for one minute arguing that Glasgow is not entitled to its fair share. However, the Minister must realise that this is the second time in two years that I have raised this matter. From the Government's own figures there appears to be a blatant bias against Edinburgh in spending on housing associations. But it is not just Edinburgh. In Glasgow £329 is spent per household; closest to that is north and south Clyde with £185. The figure for Edinburgh is £127. If the allocation were made on priority need, there would be a much more equal share per household. If I catch your eye later, Mr. Hogg, I shall develop that argument. It is not the only matter that has come to light through documents that I have managed to obtain. It is high time that the minister investigated the matter because it is patently obvious that the Scottish Homes board is not doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However fertile and entertaining the Minister's history may be, we must get back to the matter in hand. Ministerial complacency about housing such as we heard this morning is contradicted by every surgery held by every Member of Parliament present here. Minister's self-satisfaction is contradicted by the experience of people on waiting lists and who live in overcrowded or damp houses, and by the increasing number of homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The Government are driven by gimmicks and slogans and are ignorant and, in many ways, uncaring about the problems that their glossy documents fail to address. The Government's key slogan, we were told today, is choice and diversity. The public expenditure White Paper for the next four years says of Scottish housing that the first strategic objective is to "promote greater housing choice" and that the second objective is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assist and enable provisions of an adequate supply of housing."</p></blockquote>
The Government are obsessed with choice, but with one choice only—that of owner occupation. For the thousands of people who legitimately want public rented housing the Government's choice is no choice at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decline of the public rented sector has been little short of scandalous. It has been marked and deliberate and it has been disastrous for the many people who have relied on public housing in the past and who want to rely on it in the future as their individual choice, as a means of getting a start in life or as the only option open to them given their income and their circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Individuals should be given a choice and it is our duty to ensure that that choice is as wide as possible. His generous words and those of many others, in a previous Committee will long be remembered among my family. I hope that my granddaughter, who was born on 19 April, and all of my family, will have the choice about which the hon. Gentleman is speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's declaration. I wish that we had heard such frank words from the Government Front Bench. We all hope that if his grandaughter chooses to live in the public rented sector when she grows up, she will be able to find a house that is available. In 1979, when her grandfather came into Parliament, 8,063 houses were built in the public rented sector. In 1993, the year before she was born, only 823 were built. It seems that her chances of finding housing in the public rented sector will be extremely small. That underlines the hon. Gentleman's point: choice is about having choices, so the Government must ensure that people who want to enjoy owner occupation, those who want to enjoy housing association tenure and those who want to enjoy public rented housing will all have that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waiting lists are a serious and pressing problem in almost every area of Scotland. Overcrowding makes life a misery for thousands of people in Scotland and dampness affects and afflicts the lives of many Scots: 86,000 families are living in houses affected by dampness according to the Government's own statistics. Since 1980, more than 280,000 Scottish houses have been bought and have therefore left the pool of rented housing, yet the Government have supervised a situation in which only 823 publicly rented houses were built last year. That is a measure of the complacency behind the Minister's words and of the Government's glossy pamphlets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have mentioned, spending on remaining houses is also a scandal. Last year's housing support grant fell from £36 million to £25.7 million. In a single year it went down by 28 per cent. In comparison, when the previous Labour Government left office, the 1980 figure was £228 million in housing support grant, with an extra £100 million for general financing. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
money went to all councils in Scotland, whatever their political complexion and whatever their circumstances. We know that the reality now is that the miserable amount of housing support grant is given to a few councils. In terms of mainstream housing, next year only 13 councils in Scotland will enjoy any support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The projections are even worse. The Government's projections in the public expenditure statement are that there will be a cut in real terms of £12 million next year for all housing expenditure in Scotland, and that housing expenditure in Scotland will go down in real terms by £67 million over the next three years, when we know what serious problems affect people in housing. Government policy seems to be eyes shut to the problem, ears closed to appeals for help from whatever quarter, and heads firmly placed in the sand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The condition of our housing is not improving dramatically. On 17 February 1993, the Minister said that the housing conditions survey was going to
	<br><blockquote><p>"be enormously helpful in pointing the way to effective targeting of resources in the future."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 February; Vol. 219, 	<i>c.</i>445.]</p></blockquote>
The reality is that the survey identified 95,000 dwellings, almost 5 per cent. of the whole Scottish housing stock, as being below the Government's own definition of tolerable standards. Yet, the next three years will bring a reduction of Government support for housing of £67 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee and the wider audience listening outside at what point in the next century he believes that all of Scotland's people will live in houses without damp. On the basis of present spending, it will be well into the next century before people see that prospect before them. That should be to the shame of a Government who have themselves identified the problem but will not will the resources to resolve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are building fewer and fewer houses to rent They are spending less and less. They are increasing public sector rents substantially, and well above the rate of inflation, and they pretend that they have solved the problem of Scotland's housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is happening at a time when the building industry is in its worst condition for more than a generation. An unprecedented number of building workers, both skilled and unskilled, are unemployed while their resources are completely wasted. Everyone knows—there can be no contradiction—that to stimulate the housing and construction industry would produce the greatest possible stimulus to the economy. What possible sense is there in having resources wasted when there is so much need in our community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer briefly to local government re-organisation, because it will substantially affect housing in Scotland and, I forecast increase the number of people coming to our surgeries. By reducing the number of housing authorities from 53 to 32, a substantial headache will be caused for existing housing authorities. The Government's timetable, which is ludicrous, irresponsible and likely to be enormously damaging, will increase the problem and the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable is too short, too confused and too radical. There has been so little preparation that there will be major trouble in housing. Will the Minister tell the Committee what is going to happen about rents policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
How are the rents policies of the different authorities going to be subsumed into the new unitary authority? How will allocation policies be married together, and how quickly will that take place? What will happen to repairs policy and the modernisation and upgrading programmes of different local authorities when they are merged or shattered after the reorganisation takes place, if it does?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to community care programmes and policies that have been so substantially worked out by the regions? What will happen to the staff who are involved in administering housing policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, as we have said throughout the progress of the Bill to reorganise local government that the reorganisation has been ill considered and that it is unwanted and unnecessary. The turmoil and chaos that will be created by the Government pressing ahead on an impossible timetable will produce even more damage and even more cost especially to the most vulnerable people who depend on local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recently published a consultative document on homelessness, which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) may discuss in more detail. The best that can be said of it is that it is at least free from some of the hysteria and prejudice that have marked the policy of the Department of the Environment in the south. Tory housing policy appears to be based on a clapometer at the Tory party conference, not on a conscious understanding of the needs of the people of this country. That document—at least initially—has escaped the hysteria. Opposition Members and, I bet Conservative Members, hope that the conclusions of the consultation also escape the fingerprints of the Secretary of State for the Environment and what he will effect in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Homelessness is a serious problem throughout the country, no less so in Scotland: 45,000 households applied as being homeless in Scottish local authorities in 1993–93, which is up 172 per cent. on Shelter's figures dating from when it started collecting figures in 1983. That is a disgrace in a civilised community. There are 20,000 families with children homeless(at present. That problem needs to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is a lack of housing. The homeless should be helped, not blamed. If that principle applied to the Government's policy they would receive applause from Opposition Members. However, most of us, and the community in general, take umbrage at the homeless being attacked rather than helped. We must hope that the Government's attitude to Scotland is markedly different from that which they have displayed down south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every Member of Parliament knows that housing is one of the key civi rights in a society that is both humane and interested in progress and stability. An ill-housed population will be a poor-producing nation. Our national ambition in housing must be quality of life, not an obsession with one form of housing tenure. Many experts have regarded the Government's obsession with home ownership and the amount of resources that it pre-empts in our society as a key feature of the industrial decline of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing must be for the people, and it must be quality housing for the people. The crisis that the Government have created must be yet another mark of the Government's failure over 15 wasted years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see you in your place this Thursday morning, Mr. Hogg. It is certainly different from what you and I have been doing on previous Thursday mornings leading up to this Committee sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I am not alone on this side of the Committee in welcoming today's debate. It represents an area of responsibility which, as my hon. Friend the Minister has so clearly said, continues to be a success story for the Government. I am sure that, as the debate continues, Opposition Members will try to scare us with their usual rant of half-truths and misrepresentations. However, the diversity and quality of Scotland's housing stock bear testimony to the Government's achievements since 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said Scotland's housing tenure has come a long way since 1979. Then, only 35 per cent. of Scots owned their own homes; now the figure is 54 per cent. and rising. More than 280,000 public sector houses are owned by their occupants. They are the ones that are easy to spot; they almost always have a new door and the odd improvement, however modest. After all, that is the easiest way to stamp individuality on to a house—individuality, which Labour Members hate in all its guises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those 280,000 Scots families would do well to remember which party fought tooth and nail to deny them that right of ownership. Many of the guilty men are still here today, such as the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), who proudly voted in 1980 to deny the people of Scotland that fundamental right. In 1983, the Labour party said that it would
	<br><blockquote><p>"end enforced council house sales"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"empower public landlords to repurchase homes sold under the Tories".</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have waited until I finished. I was asking whether the Labour party, in its heart of hearts, has changed what it believes or merely what it says for the sake of electoral expediency. I accept that the words I quoted were said more than 10 years ago. That was in the days when the Labour party actually believed in something and had concrete policies, however misguided But Labour Members saw how popular the right-to-buy policy was and quietly sidelined and ditched their opposition to it. It was a pity that they forgot to tell their socialist brothers and sisters on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
district councils, who treat those district councils like an inherited fiefdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland will not forget that, although the Labour party is not in office nationally, in town halls throughout Scotland it is the party in government In Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dundee, Hamilton and, dare I say, Monklands, the Labour party is responsible for the housing needs of tens of thousands of Scots, and it has often been found wanting. It is called municipal socialism, and it does not work. We are told that dogma and ideology no longer play a part in crown prince Tony's Westminster Labour party, but it plays a big part in the Labour party in town halls and council chambers throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has, over decades, regarded council housing only as a tool to gerrymander or as a weapon to keep people firmly in their place. Labour Members will try to deny it, but what other explanation is there for the frequency and location of the ghastly tower blocks in our cities which are so obviously out of keeping with their surrounding environment? One can almost picture Keir Hardie house in the 1960s and 1970s, with some labour apparatchik—perhaps the hon. Member for Hamilton or the hon. Member for Monklands, East—shifting model tower blocks across maps of our towns and cities. It would have been a matter of, "Marginal ward at 2 o'clock, send in three mums."' The right to buy cuts across all of that, and that is why home ownership is alien to the Labour party. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I want to hear what he is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Home ownership is alien to the Labour party because it releases people. They are no longer beholden to the council; if they want to move house, they can. They sell up and move on—often they move up. They do not need to join a waiting list for 18 months, or go on bended knees to the local councillor. They have been empowered. The Government have empowered the people and given them choice in a significant part of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state, in any of its guises, should have no role in the colour of people's doors or when they get new windows. The state, in any of its guises, should not take a lifetime's rent from people, leaving them with nothing to show at the end of it. The Government have given families the length and breadth of the country their first taste of ownership, and they like it. They like having a tangible asset; they enjoy the prospect of being able to leave something to the next generation and having a right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How fair is Labour in action—or should that be how fair is Labour inaction? Late last year, I examined the council house sales in my local authority, the city of Aberdeen district council. The findings were not reassuring; on average, the time taken to process a right to buy in Aberdeen was more than 14 months. The Scottish average was eight months. Things are improving, but the process should be swift and efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another disturbing trend is that Aberdeen sold just over 20 per cent. of its housing stock, the lowest Scottish figure apart from those of the socialist monolith, Strathclyde. My hon. Friend continues to consider new initiatives to allow more families to enjoy the benefit of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
home ownership, and I urge him to consider what more can be done. If all Scotland's housing needs are to be met, a mixture of tenure, involving local authority housing, Scottish Homes, private housing and housing associations, is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past two decades, north-east Scotland, especially Aberdeen, has faced tremendous housing pressures, but it has coped. Before hon. Members start bandying the homeless figures about the Committee, I shall make one point clear. The hon. Member for Hamilton spoke about his constituency surgeries. In my constituency surgeries—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned homelessness. Will he consider my homeless constituents in the Aberdeen city council district? The properties offered to them to get them off the homeless list are uninhabitable. Aberdeen district council says that it has met its obligations to offer those people a house and put them on a waiting list. Those poor homeless people then come in desperation to their Member of Parliament. Does my hon. Friend join me in condemning Aberdeen city council for its inactivity in the matter of homelessness and in condemning the Labour party's ramblings on the subject?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly join my hon. Friend in his views. I am always staggered when constituents, desperate to move from one council house to another, come to see me because they are the victims of a byzantine points procedure. Often, they can tell me the exact address of a house and how long is has been vacant, but the city district council housing department does nothing to move the housing stock. It is time that local authorities concentrated less on grandiose schemes and headline-grabbing and more on ensuring a rapid turnaround of vacant properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to buy is one success story, and there is another: the Aberdeen city centre project in the heart of my constituency, which I highlight because it is a model which other towns and cities would be wise to follow. The project is an example of partnership at its best. Two local authorities, Grampian Enterprise and Scottish Homes, are working together, with Scottish Homes as the catalyst, with the objective of stimulating investment in Aberdeen city centre and enhancing its vitality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the late 1980s, Union street and its environs looked jaded. A combination of factors led to far too many "to let" hoardings and people started to leave the city centre. The city centre project has reversed that trend and it is helping to return Union street to its former glory, and not just in respect of shopping. Like every other city centre, the hustle and bustle stops when the shops shut; people traditionally drift off to the suburbs, leaving the centre to the late-night reveller, the vandal or worse. The city centre project has set itself the target of creating 1,000 homes in Union street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, the buildings already exist, lying empty, or they are in run-down, gap sites which attract trouble. Refurbishing and building will provide much-needed homes which will suit a wide variety of incomes, needs and tastes. The commercial city centre will have a permanent population of more man 2,000 people, all doing their bit to give the city centre 24-hour vibrancy and life. That innovative approach to housing dispersal
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
in which Scottish Homes has a key role will play a major part in cutting crime. It vindicates the Government's decision to set up a body which can tackle all problems with a new and imaginative approach. Such initiatives can bring about a renaissance in all of Scotland's inner-city areas; it is certainly working in Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to come to my constituency to see the excellent work being done by the Aberdeen city centre project. He does not tire of visiting the countless projects that the Government have initiated, and he probably spends more time on housing estates than all Opposition Members put together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have changed the face of Scottish housing since 1979. The electorate, I must concede, have not always rewarded us with their votes, but that has not made our efforts any less worthy. We are doing our bit, and it is time that Opposition Members went back to their constituencies and told their council colleagues to get their act together and understand that people are precious assets and not pawns in a sordid little municipal power game.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton said, 90 per cent. of surgery cases concern housing and related problems.

The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) often talks about multi-storey dwellings. He needs a history lesson on how such dwellings came to be built in Glasgow and other cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be more multi-storey dwellings in my constituency than in any other. Some of them are a credit to their tenants because they are absolutely beautiful. The hon. Gentleman does them a disservice by talking about big, ugly multi-storey dwellings. Some may have difficulties, but the Carron scheme, Balgrayhill and Ladywell, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson), are absolutely beautiful. If those buildings were in London, people would pay many thousands of pounds to live in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the old Glasgow corporation was desperate for housing, it wanted conventional houses to be built, but the building companies down here, with their slick public relations people, lobbied Tory Ministers and said that we must build more non-traditional housing. Labour and Conservative councils throughout the country were told that they could build housing to take people out of slums but that it must be non-traditional. That is how the multi-storey and deck-access buildings came to Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South might want to know that many of those multi-storey dwellings have been demolished by Labour-controlled authorities. He is trying to exploit a myth when he says that Labour-controlled authorities want to build more multi-storey dwellings. In fact, the cry from the Labour party is to get back to conventional housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South says that the Conservative party has done the people of Glasgow and many other places a great service. Those people have not been especially grateful to the Tories in Glasgow, because,

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
as recently as last Thursday, when there was a by-election in Monklands, East and a municipal by-election in my constituency, the Tories won only 7 per cent. of the vote in Monklands and even less—only 2 per cent.—in my area. The separatists did not do all that well, either—they came behind Tommy Sheridan's rag, tag and bobtails in Militant The hon. Gentleman must try to get his message across more effectively.

Every multi-storey flat is entitled to a concierge system. Gone are the days when one Yale lock would do. Now there are many kinds of locks, because people are insecure in both public and private housing estates. People feel insecure even in estates in which there is little or no vandalism or housebreaking. If a vandal or housebreaker gets into a multi-storey dwelling he can cause all sorts of havoc. It has been shown that, where there is investment in the concierge system, tenants feel more secure, and young couples are more willing to occupy the flats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend's comments about multi-storey flats of which there are many in my constituency with the concierge system. Does he agree that the Government should adopt greater realism in their assumptions about the management and maintenance of local authority housing? Does he also agree that their underestimation of need seriously affects the structure of the housing support grant and the way in which councils such as Glasgow district council care for existing housing and provide for people who are on the housing list but want to remove themselves and find decent housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. There must be greater Government support for councils.

It would be a sad day if he were not to fight his corner in Edinburgh as I am trying to do for Glasgow. Because of the problems of the concierge system in such places as Sighthill, of which the Minister knows, and in Charles street flats and the many other places with multi-storey flats, the Government must co-operate with the local authority.

Conservative Members have talked of the faceless peripheral schemes in which no one wants to live. I have relatives who in the 1950s went from the city centre slums out to Gorthamlock and they are still there. They raised their families there and enjoy living there. Conservative Members yet again do a disservice by saying that generally such places are terrible. They are not. There are pockets within the schemes that need much attention, but there are also excellent places amongst them. Places such as Balornock, Barmulloch, Hamilton hill and Germiston in my constituency, which could be considered peripheral
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
housing schemes, have strong community ties. People have lived there for generations and do not want to leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Large-scale demolition is taking place in many housing estates because of the Government's withdrawal of financing. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) can tell us about the demolition that is going on in Ruchill, Possilpark and Haghill because the local authority is not receiving enough funds from the Government to maintain properties. Those of us who were brought up in the old tenements with outside toilets and no bath, apart from the municipal baths perhaps a mile away, are sad that houses with two or three apartment dwellings and good facilities are being demolished while homeless people five in the streets of Glasgow, London and other cities. It is an indictment of our society that decent homes are being pulled down after undergoing rehabilitation as recently as 15 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that only in special circumstances would a local authority be able to house Scottish Homes tenants transferred to it. He should remember that in 1976, in good faith, Glasgow district council handed over substantial housing stock to Scottish Homes which promised to manage and care for it. It was not part of the deal that at a later stage it would give up the property to a private factor if a ballot went that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1970s, Glasgow district council handed over housing stock. I can name the streets involved: Syriam street: Mansel street and property at Barmulloch. It would be unfair if the tenants could not say in the ballot that they want to consider the option of having Glasgow district council as their landlord. The Minister should remember that, in Glasgow, there is distrust of the old private landlords who ran the slums such as Hacking and Paterson, Spiers-Parnie and Adams and all those who took the rents over a lifetime from people such as my parents and their neighbours but who did not even carry out a repair. I cannot recall a winter in the house in which I was brought up—a top flat in Anderston—when rain did not come in. My brothers, sisters and I were woken up in the middle of the night to move the beds so that my mother could put down a bucket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is to be even-handed, he should criticise the private landlords who were deplorable in taking rents from people but who did not carry out repairs. That is why people were desperate to get into Easterhouse and Drumchapel in the 1950s. The private landlords let them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is trying to get ballots for the Scottish Homes people to get them back to the private landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Martin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way because others want to speak. The Minister is doing even worse than that. Pressure is being put on the officials in Scottish Homes to start up management schemes. They are being told that if blocks of property do not have management schemes that they can run, they will be out of a job by this time next year. Officials of Scottish Homes are running around housing estates, telling people, "Take the option and we shall manage your property", simply because they could be out of a job. That is a wee bit like a doubleglazing salesman being told that if he does not get a sale he is out of a job. That is the scandal that has arisen since the Government took over.

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I was heartened to hear the Minister say that there will be investment in certain properties. Could he spare a thought for the Dennistoun area? At present, the housing associations are in places which they have rehabilitated and which were below the tolerable standard—in other words, which had outside toilets. There is property in the Dennistoun area where teachers, those who worked in banks and professional people lived. They were beautiful tenements; some had four apartments and bathrooms. However, they have Men into decline. In many instances, the private factor has deserted the properties. There is a terrible case in which a girl paid £30,000 for a flat There is a bulge in the outside wall and the rain pours in. Despite that the properties do not attract the grants that are attracted by houses below the tolerable standard. If we do not consider that beautiful property, we shall lose it. That would be a sad day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should mention private developers. We all know how desperate people are when taking out a mortgage. Some young couples take on two and three jobs. A husband might work during the day and at night; or, he might work during the day, and, when he comes home, he might look after the children while his wife goes out to do a twilight shift. They do that simply so that they can maintain their mortgage. Such is their desire to have a decent home for their family and to bring up their children in a decent environment Their mortgage is sometimes 30 years long but they are prepared to put that millstone around their necks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do private developers do? They build a house with a front garden but with nothing in the back and they promise that within five or six years, there will be schools and a play area down the road with swings for the children and that they will attract shops. As soon as the developers have sold the last house on the estate they are off, leaving people with an estate which has no facilities. Something should be written into Scottish law so that developers must be committed to carry out the promises that they make in their brochures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I have taken up such cases with aggrieved tenants who have complained about private estates where the developers' promises have not been carried out, I have discovered that the company has changed its name, or that it has gone into liquidation and is trading somewhere else under another name. That is extremely unfair, and I hope that the Minister will consider that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his factual account of housing in Scotland and for the excellent and commendable objectives and targets that he laid out. I should also like to commend some of the words of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) who gave a knowledgeable account of the situation in some of the most difficult housing areas in the country. I do not agree with all that he said but he did not present a bowl for some of the things that he suggested are needed. I recognise the validity of some of the things that he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In stark contrast were the words of the hon. Member for Hamilton and the interventions of many Opposition Members which seemed to suggest that they are living in the past Their views contrast with the new image of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Labour party and the new leader-elect—a media-selected career politician and former public schoolboy. The hon. Member for Hamilton referred to the background of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), but the background of the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) suggests that he may have not had much more experience of ill-housing than the hon. Member for Hamilton suggested that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the Labour party as it is today, I think that their is change abroad. It is recognised that it was unelectable in the past. On that basis, the party hierarchy appears to be looking for change and a new low-spend Labour party which contrasts with the words of the hon. Member for Hamilton. If he wants to maintain his place on the Front Bench, he should fall into line with others, particularly on housing issues on which he has advocated what can only be considered high-spend policies for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall that the post-war Labour Government of 1945 introduced legislation that destroyed the private rented sector? Anyone commenting about leaking roofs and so on must bear that in mind. I note that the Labour Front Bench Members, under their potential new leadership, are not telling us what they will do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept totally my hon. Friend's comments and shall comment further on them as I progress. My hon. Friend the Minister spoke about a new direction in Scottish housing in recent years. It seems to me fundamental that state provision of houses is needed as there will always be those who cannot provide for themselves and the system must cater for those individuals. But the high level of state provision experienced in the past—more than 60 per cent. in 1979—had to change. Levels of public ownership in Scotland then were higher than in most eastern European countries, which Labour Members used to hold up as a shining light, the way ahead, and socialism in reality. Many Labour Members, such as the hon. Member for Hamilton, now deny that. Some members of the Labour party have not totally lost such notions, but these are changed days. Such ideas are now unfashionable to most of the Labour party and its leadership, which has recognised the failure of socialist systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A change in housing policy must follow. Local authority capital expenditure has been cut. That has not occurred just during recent times. Between 1974–75 and 1979—the period of the previous Labour Government—housing expenditure in Scotland was reduced by 35 per cent. in real terms. In the 14 years that followed, the reduction in real terms has been 4 per cent. under the Conservative Government but there have been considerable changes during that time. Owner occupation in Scotland in 1979 was 35 per cent. Today it is 55 per cent. That has brought about greater pride in property, greater care and greater personal investment for upgrading and expanding the housing stock. It has also brought about capital investment and work opportunities, as people have renovated, improved and built on to their houses. Such things would never have happened had those houses been left in public ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
I was elected as a district councillor in 1980, when the housing stock in many areas of my local authority was in a pretty poor state. That has changed over the years. The Government have encouraged investment, improvement and modernisation. There may not have been a great increase in building, but policies to encourage modernisation have improved the housing stock, as has been recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn spoke of the deplorable conditions that obtained in the 1950s. I can remember that time—my housing experiences are similar to those of the hon. Gentleman—but I recognise the vast improvements across the board since then. The Government must take considerable credit for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I single out one policy as especially important—that is, the upgrading of private properties and the encouragement of private rental, which was brought about by the repairs and improvement grant scheme introduced in the early 1980s. Grants were levelled at between 50 per cent. and 90 per cent. and they are now between 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. The grant system did much to encourage people to invest, change and improve the housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, when my hon. Friend the Minister considers the results of the working party, he will examine carefully the ways in which we can improve the repairs and improvement grant system, which is of great value for individuals and is central to investment in housing. In the end, housing policy is about people. It is people who count and who are all-important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many changes, such as in the way in which local authorities receive revenue support for housing Nowadays, tenants in the public housing sector pay their way. There has been a major change in housing benefit. Individuals, rather than houses, attract financial support from Government. That, too, is important. When we consider the expenditure of 1979 and that of today and recognise that there have been reductions in revenue support to local authorities, we also have to consider the housing benefit that has been provided—£700 million, to which my hon. Friend referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other changes in housing requirements. There have been changes in demand for housing and changes in society, which Governments have to recognise and address. A major change is occurring in family life. Sadly, there have been family break-ups. In the past, one family needed one house, but after today two families need two houses. That is perhaps not a major issue, but it is a factor when we examine the way in which we will have to find cash for housing in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes such as the tenants charter and the right to buy, which were opposed by Opposition Members, are regarded as having been highly successful. Opposition Members sometimes claim ownership of those ideas. There have been tenants' discounts, rent-to-mortgage schemes and another excellent scheme that I want to identify: the tenants' incentive scheme, in which capital grants can be made to individuals who can move out of a public authority home and into a private home, with considerable cash grants from Government sources through local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That policy is good because, in many ways, the money provided can take the place of four or five local authority houses which would have been required to meet the need, so by—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. For a horrible moment I thought that I had strayed from the issue and could not quite grasp why that had happened. I am pleased that it was another hon. Member who had erred. I thought that my words were so riveting that anyone would have found it difficult to look at a newspaper. Obviously, I am not impressing to the extent that I would have liked. However, I must stress that the incentive scheme is good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is about homelessness. Once again, I do not step back from the fact that the homeless must have priority treatment. I also cannot step back from the fact that the treatment of the homeless creates great anger among many of my constituents, such as young couples who have lived with their parents in overcrowded conditions and have waited their time on the list. They, above all, feel great resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members criticise Conservative Members when we dare to refer to single parents and the priority that they are given under homelessness Acts. I make no apology for that. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that, in many instances, young single parents are done no service whatever if they are given a house under the homeless rules. Rather, we should go a step further. There are already hostels, but we should examine the idea of sheltered complexes in which young single parents could enter an environment in which they would have comradeship and a form of discipline, perhaps instilled by a warden. Above all, they would not be thrown out into communities to be left isolated and abandoned, and a predatory source for their peers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members might not identify with those comments, but the problem is real. All too often, young single parents are thrust into the community and left alone. They are put under great pressure from others in their age group; they do not benefit from the current system. Finally—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Finally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not quite, but just about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the work of groups such as Hanover, the Church of Scotland and others for providing sheltered housing for the elderly. I recognise the good work undertaken by groups such as the Richmond Fellowship for special needs for the mentally disabled. With community care coming into the limelight as it currently is, there is a great need to consider housing provision for such people. I have already referred to young single mums; nothing can be worse than taking people out of the enclosure of institutions and thrusting them into communities and leaving them alone. That is matter of priority in housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) referred yesterday in the House and again today to Scottish Homes and the disposal of stock I noted the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister about the possibility of Scottish Homes recognising the small pockets of houses that are virtually cut off from other communities. In some instances, there is no identification with other projects whereby local authorities take on those homes.

In the past, I have written to the Minister about Symington—a small village in my constituency. Kyle and Carrick district council manages the Scottish Homes housing stock. There would be some benefit in stepping away from a preferred option and allowing local authorities to take on the ownership of small portions of the stock of Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Springburn that 90 per cent. of my constituents certainly do not come to my surgeries to talk about housing. Perhaps that is because my constituency has a good Tory council, which is made up of a large majority of Tory councillors who deal with the issues for which they are responsible. It is their duty to look at housing issues. My Tory councillors are doing very well on that basis and, to a degree, they release the burden of housing complaints at my constituency surgeries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Committee's attention to the spending practices of Scottish Homes. The Minister has referred already to a newspaper article in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I do not want to engage in a silly debate about practices in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland has already paid the price for that Earlier this year, in all probability, we lost the chance of having a new national gallery because of the narrow debate about the differences between Edinburgh and Glasgow. I want to talk about how Scottish Homes spends its money throughout Scotland. Clearly, however, as a Member of Parliament who represents Edinburgh, I should mention that city. Given that more money is spent per household in Glasgow than in Edinburgh, it is inevitable that the names of the two cities will crop up in such debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is high time that the Government and Scottish Homes recognised that Edinburgh is more than just Princes street and the Georgian facades of the new town. There is just as much need—as there is just as much poverty—in Edinburgh as there is in any other city in the United Kingdom. Equally, it is not true to assume that Glasgow is all like Easterhouse. Parts of Glasgow are doing very well and have been greatly improved. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow have needs and it is the duty of Scottish Homes, as an agency that spends public money, to ensure that the whole of Scotland is treated fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Government's figures, there are 4,200 households with priority need in Edinburgh. In Glasgow, there are 3,300. Let us consider the way in which Scottish Homes has allocated its spending this year. In Edinburgh, £127 is spent per household. In Glasgow, £329 is spent per household. Why is there such a discrepancy? For the sake of completeness, only £98 is spent per household in the Highlands and Islands, and in Grampian. The closest figures to those in Glasgow are those in the areas of Dumbarton and Paisley in north and south Clyde where only £185 is spent per household. There is no reason for such a discrepancy in the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that spending in Edinburgh has risen by 60 per cent. Perhaps it has, but 60 per cent. off a low base is not much. The Government have a duty to investigate the matter to find out why there is such a discrepancy. If the money were allocated on the basis of priority need, Edinburgh would have £204 spent per
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
household, compared with Glasgow's £193, and those are based on the Government's figures. What are the criteria? A representative of Scottish Homes is quoted in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> as saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Through careful investment planning processes involving ourselves and our partners … Scottish Homes have identified particular priority areas for investment throughout Scotland and determines this through detailed analysis of housing requirements in all areas of the country".</p></blockquote>
That could mean anything. Scottish Homes was unable to justify the discrepancy two years ago when I raised the matter on behalf of housing associations in Edinburgh and it is unable to do so now. There is a huge gap in spending per household between the east of Scotland and Glasgow. Other areas of Scotland have cause for complaint too; they all suffer because of the apparent imbalance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh this year, housing associations are building 600 houses for social rent If they had their fair share, they could build 400 more houses a year, that would mean 1,000 extra homes built or rehabilitated this year. It does not wash for the Minister to say that he has everything under control; it lacks credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a discrepancy in respect of rents, too. In Edinburgh, the average housing association rent is £32. In Glasgow it is £23. There is only a small gap in the local authority rent; it is £32 in Edinburgh and £30 Glasgow. Do the problems relate to cost? Land prices in Edinburgh are probably higher than they are in most parts of the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I managed to obtain from Scottish Homes some internal documents which may have a bearing on the problem. In Lothian and Borders, Scottish Homes assumes the unit cost of building a new house to be £50,000; in Lanarkshire and Central it is £48,000, and in Glasgow it is £55,000. It apparently costs more to build a new house in Glasgow than it does in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rehabilitation costs paint an odd picture. In Edinburgh, the average unit cost is £45,000; in Lanarkshire and Central it is £40,000, but in Glasgow it is £56,000. Why is it so much more? The housing stock is not much different. The older, tenemental stock in Edinburgh is very expensive to rehabilitate because much of it is 100 or 200 years old and listed. However, the post-war stock being modernised is basically the same throughout the country, and I do not understand why there is such a discrepancy. If there are good reasons for that, Scottish Homes should tell us what they are, but it will not. Trying to get information from Scottish Homes is as difficult as trying to learn a state secret Most commercial companies are more open, and I wonder why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Need is not confined to geographical boundaries; it exists throughout Scotland. Other areas besides Edinburgh, Lothian and the Borders are losing out I do not begrudge Glasgow a single penny, as I accept that it has formidable problems which require years of work, but it is not the only city. I do not apologise for making a constituency point; that is what hon. Members are here to do. I am not prepared for Edinburgh to lose out time and again, as there is no justification for that It is high time that the Minister took an interest in the matter, as I am not confident that the Scottish Homes board is doing so. Some wonder what exactly it does do. As an Edinburgh Member of Parliament, the Minister would agree that it is time that the matter was publicly investigated and explained.

The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) mentioned the home improvement grant programme. In Edinburgh, £100 million of repairs are outstanding and it will take until the next century to carry them out. Applications for improvement grants made before 1984 will not be dealt with until well into the mid-1990s, and those who applied after that time will have to wait until the next century to receive the grants. The longer the time that elapses, the more expensive the work becomes as the condition of the property deteriorates. In Scottish Questions earlier this year, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"About £500,000 had been spent on housing associations in Glasgow—which, at one stage, was nearly half the total expenditure on housing associations." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 April; Vol. 242; c. 228.]</p></blockquote>
Good. I am sure that it was needed, and that Glasgow could do with a lot more. But Edinburgh needs that sort of money as well. I have written to the Scottish Office on numerous occasions, asking the Minister to do something about it, and yet absolutely nothing has happened. It is quite intolerable that there is such need throughout Scotland. I am making an unashamed Edinburgh point, because it is high time that those of us who represent Edinburgh constituencies brought to public attention the fact that Edinburgh is not simply Princes street—there is more to it than that. It has needs that must be met, but Scottish Homes and the Government are not dealing with those needs.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not own a string of greyhounds, like the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey), but I do risk the occasional pound. So imagine my disappointment when, pound in hand, I went yesterday to place my bet on who would be the next Secretary of State for Scotland, only to be told that there was no book on the matter because of lack of public interest. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am sure that that must be a blow to the egos of the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), the two horses competing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be no public interest in who will become the next Secretary of State for Scotland, but there is a huge amount of public interest in housing. There is no area of social provision that touches the fives of more people in Scotland, and no issue that causes more misery than the inadequate provision of housing in many areas of Scotland and the issues of dampness and homelessness.

I shall be quoting some of the statistics that I was bandying about earlier. The £1,800 million of lost housing support grant over the past 14 years is an issue. It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that housing benefit has increased in the meantime. Housing benefit is not the mirror image of the collapse of housing support grant The rise in housing benefit is an estimate, and a measure of rising unemployment. It is also a measure of Scotland's rising rents, which have increased fivefold—about twice the level of inflation over the past 14 years. It does not benefit tenants to receive more housing benefit because their rent is now much higher than it was previously. Will the Minister tell us what has happened regarding the lack of public housing investment as a result of the collapse of the housing support grant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key statistic in Scottish housing is the overhang of capital debt, which affects almost every council the length and breadth of the country. In Scotland as a whole, for every pound collected in rent, 62p goes in interest and debt repayments. In Glasgow, the figure is more than 70p in the pound, and in Gordon district—quite ludicrously—for every pound of rent collected, the council pays out £1.27 in debt repayment. How can any council invest adequately in repairs and maintenance when it has to pay out as much or more in debt repayment as it receives in rent. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I heard the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) say something about rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that they are still too low. I remind him that there has been a fivefold increase in rents in Scotland over the past 14 years—twice the level of inflation. This year the projected increase is again twice the level of inflation. I do not know what level of rent the hon. Member for Tayside, North deems acceptable for people in public sector housing. I can think of hardly any item of expenditure which has risen faster for individuals than the rent they have to pay for council housing in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman should not be in any doubt, I shall repeat what I have said in all my years in public life. The rent for a house should be the economic rent that guarantees its survival, and those who need assistance should get it through housing benefit. That makes economic sense and is the kind of situation in which I grew up, in a council house owned by an enlightened authority in Dundee before the war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's idea of enlightenment may be entirely different from that of the rest of the Committee. The people of Scotland will note that the hon. Gentleman, who in other respects claims to be a great sound money man who wants to combat inflation, endorses the fivefold increase in rents in Scotland during the past 14 years. He is accelerating his walk to the political gallows and I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the overhang of debt, it is impossible for Scottish councils to find the money that would be required to improve the Scottish housing stock. The solution is to transfer the debt from local authorities to central Government to release the resources that are required to tackle Scottish housing problems. If that were done over a period of four years, the resources released would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
amount to about £ 1,300 million—not as much as Scottish councils have lost during the past 14 years, but none the less the kind of sum that would need to be invested to bring the standard of Scottish housing up to an acceptable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about homelessness. If I heard him correctly, he said that 2,500 units were to be provided to tackle the problem of homelessness in Scotland. I am not sure what time scale he was envisaging. As was said earlier, 45,000 people presented themselves as homeless in Scotland during the past year. If the 2,500 units are projected to be completed in a year, a quick calculation shows that it would take 20 years to house all those who are currently homeless, never mind the continuing flow of people on to the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, as a compassionate man, cannot believe that 2,500 units can come anywhere near to meeting the problem of homelessness that we have in Scotland. The statistics show that 12,000 young people in Scotland present themselves as homeless, of whom one in every seven is subsequently housed by a district council. About 5,000 young people in Scotland are currently sleeping rough. The Minister spoke a great deal about choice in housing. What choice is available to any of those 5,000 youngsters? Perhaps, as the waiting lists are so long in many areas, someone of 16 to 17 has a better chance of getting a house in Scotland before reaching retirement age than many of the other people who are waiting. Where there is an inadequate supply of quality housing, there is no choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's own agency, Scottish Homes, carried out a survey which showed that 95,000 Scottish homes are below tolerable standard, the most common problem being dampness. The criteria that determine what is a tolerable standard are themselves inadequate as, for example, they make no provision for energy efficiency: a house can be completely impossible to heat because of lack of insulation but still qualify as of tolerable standard according to the criteria of the Government's main housing agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister replied earlier—rather well, I thought—to a question about his own housing provision. If he and other members of the Committee are honest with themselves they will admit that, in addition to the 95,000 houses identified by Scottish Homes as being below tolerable standards, there are hundreds of thousands of houses in Scotland in which they would not care to live. The problem of sub-standard housing is enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Housing, which I believe to be an independent and well respected body, has said that 15,000 new houses are needed in Scotland every year as part of the replacement stock that is vital to maintaining the provision of housing in Scotland. That is a long way from the figure of 2,500 identified in the Minister's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a role for an agency the sole purpose of which is to provide good quality housing, but the existing Scottish Homes organisation, although staffed by many talented people, does not fulfil that function. It is too committed to selling off homes, instead of providing them. A housing agency whose main aim is to get out of housing is simply not acceptable in modern Scotland. The focus must be changed. We need a housing agency that is charged with meeting the problems of Scottish housing, not with avoiding them. We do not need a housing agency whose
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
sole aim and intent seems to be to sell off as many houses as possible at whatever price it can get, and sometimes below the price that it could have obtained from other sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Government's exemplary mismanagement, Scotland is still the 25th richest country on earth, according to the OECD's current statistics. The 25th richest country on earth should be able to fulfil the basic minimum requirement of ensuring that all members of its population have a decent roof over their head and a decent home to five in. That is not an overambitious target for modern Scotland, and it is to the shame of the governing party that it has so manifestly failed to meet that target over the past 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my brief contribution I want to ask the Minister about the housing needs of the disabled in the community. My questions are prompted by the concerns expressed to me by such constituents and also by the excellent Ewing inquiry report. The inquiry was set up by Disability Scotland last year and was chaired by Lord Ewing of Kirkford. Its remit was
	<br><blockquote><p>"To investigate the ability of People with Physical Disabilities to gain access to housing which suits their needs."</p></blockquote>
Over the years, wheelchair users and other people with similar needs have been badly served by the Scottish Office under different Administrations and by local authority housing departments, architects, house builders and, more recently, some housing associations and Scottish Homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some notable exceptions to that dismal record—for example, the Margaret Blackwood housing association has a fine history. The Minister is coming to Greenock tomorrow formally to open the MacLehose sheltered housing complex in Eldon street. He may be interested to know that I shall be there as well. The booklet that accompanies the invitation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"MacLehose Court is a scheme of 18 Supported Flatlets, 9 Sheltered Flats, 5 Independent Houses for people who are disabled and 16 houses for Elderly Amenity and Mainstream tenants. It represents a milestone in the promotion of Care in the Community and integrated living within Inverclyde and provides much needed specifically designed accommodation for physically disabled people and their families."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely what we do not have in Scotland—specifically designed accommodation for people in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ewing report criticises housing associations for failing to take cognisance of the needs of such people. Page 11 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The survey carried out by this Inquiry suggested that a significant number of associations have been slow to improve accessibility in their house design and that only a few associations appeared to have convincing policies on the provision of wheelchair and mobility housing as a standard part of all their general housing stock."</p></blockquote>
That is not true of all housing associations, but, as Harry Ewing and his excellent committee say, some housing associations leave a great deal to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that some local authorities have a good record in that respect. The Dundee district council, with its standing committee for housing physically disabled people, has done excellent work on behalf of such tenants. Dundee currently has 280 full wheelchair-standard dwellings, 180 of which are owned by the district council. Not many local authorities can claim such a fine record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
I remind the Minister, if he needs reminding, that about 45,000 people in Scotland have to use wheelchairs—about 0.9 per cent. of the population. The 1991 census revealed that fully 25 per cent. of all households in Scotland included someone suffering from a limiting long-term illness. Of those people, 100,000 lived in accommodation that had no facilities at ground floor level. I mentioned earlier the Scottish Office target of 1 per cent. of all housing stock being designed to wheelchair standards and a further 10 per cent. to mobility standards. The Minister promised to answer when winding up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ewing report was also critical of Scottish Homes. On page 17, the report states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Homes intends to promote the Barrier Free approach to house design through encouragement, expectation and influence, rather than making the standards part of its housing grant conditions. This approach contrasts with the Housing Corporation's policy in England where accessible standards are now a condition of Housing Grant."</p></blockquote>
That is one regard in which we should follow the English example. The Ewing report goes on to say that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"welcomes the introduction of a policy by Scottish Homes to improve accessibility in house design but strongly regrets that Scottish Homes' policy for Barrier Free housing will not make the standards a condition of grant."</p></blockquote>
Again, that is a matter for regret. Scottish Homes seeks to allocate housing association grants in a more rationalised way, as outlined in its recent document "Scottish Homes' Future Relationship with Housing Associations and Co-operatives". However, it should not be done by encouragement and by larger associations but on the basis of barrier free housing criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another concern voiced by the Ewing inquiry about Scottish Homes' poor record relates to the transfer of housing stock. The report states that Scottish Homes should:
	<br><blockquote><p>"impose conditions on all stock transfers committing the new owners to a barrier free policy."</p></blockquote>
I look to the Minister for an assurance that that is the sort of guidance that he has given to Scottish Homes, so that a condition of transfer of housing stock will be that a new landlord will implement a barrier free policy. As the Ewing report argues, there should be a written commitment that a percentage of houses will be barrier free and that some will be converted to full wheelchair standards. Disabled people deserve nothing less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report makes several recommendations that prompt questions—I have finally reached my questions. Will the Minister confirm that his officials have in the recent past reviewed and updated the Scottish housing handbooks Nos. 5 and 6, entitled "Housing for the Elderly" and "Housing for the Disabled"? Are they being revised in relation to barrier free standards? What discussions have taken place with the housing building industry, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and other interested parties about barrier free housing design? I hope that that subject is to be found now on the syllabus of all architectural courses in university departments of architecture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also ask the Minister whether the Scottish Office is reviewing the building regulations in terms of much-needed amendments in dealing with improved accessibility? There is a disjunction between the building regulations concerning public buildings and those concerning houses. If there is a disjunction, surely it should be eliminated for disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
A system of rights is needed for disabled people so that they can be protected where housing associations, Scottish Homes, local authorities and others fail to take cognisance of their needs and anxieties. Disabled people have been treated harshly in terms of employment and their housing needs. They deserve more from the Government and, indeed, from all of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When Scottish Homes was established as an institution to—we thought—revitalise housing in Scotland we did not envisage that it would want to divest itself of its landlord role. I want to register that point and the worries that members of the Committee have expressed: that divestment has caused apprehension and anxiety, particularly among the retired and elderly living in sheltered housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such people fear a move into the unknown and had not expected to spend their latter years fighting to maintain the status quo. Many of them are facing a transfer to another landlord who is likely to increase the rents and withdraw warden services, which many find so reassuring, and replace them with a sort of soulless alarm system, particularly for night and weekend cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Scottish Homes divests itself of its property, some 2,000 homes in the highlands and islands of an original total of 3,700 have gone to a bewildering array of housing associations. Of course, nowhere does the local authority appear as an option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes must honour the commitment made by the Minister yesterday. I welcome him saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the end of the day, if a majority of tenants wish to remain in the public sector, they will have the opportunity to do so through the ballot paper and by voting to remain with Scottish Homes."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 July 1994; Vol. 246, 	<i>c.</i> 309.]</p></blockquote>
Tenants must not be pressured into agreeing to transfer from Scottish Homes to another association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there is a particular sheltered housing complex which has battled with Scottish Homes for the past four years to avoid transfer to another housing association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that Scottish Office figures published in March 1994 show that a record 42,500 households claimed to be homeless in 1992–93. That is up 5 per cent. on the 1991–92 figures. The figure of 42,500 shows not the number of people without a permanent roof over their heads but the number of families, or households as the Government refer to them, who are homeless. A rough estimate of the number of homeless people in Scotland indicates that probably about 60,000 people are in that position. That estimate is based on information compiled by the Scottish Office about the types of households that claim homelessness status under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988. I should like the Government to publish the number of people who are actually homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that as the hon. Member for Ayr said, it causes great distress and anger when people who have been legitimately on waiting lists for, often, one or two years find houses being handed over to homeless people who have often just come into an area. The answer to that is that the Government should build more houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to tell the Minister about problems faced by students over the council tax as an example of how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
people become homeless. Three students sharing a flat had no liability for the council tax. In this case, one of them graduated last year but has been unable to get a job. She entered a training for work course but, because she is unemployed, her status sets the standard for the property and all three of them are liable to pay the tax. The other two cannot afford to have an unemployed person in the flat, so she must leave and become homeless. That is a vicious circle. We all know that students are finding it more difficult to cope. Perhaps the Minister could offer a solution to that sort of situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has previously heard me talking about holiday homes and he knows that I represent a rural constituency. Today, I am really speaking for the rural areas of Scotland. Holiday homes are a menace or a blessing. I see that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) is shaking his head but I have not heard him speaking much about rural housing. To continue, are they a menace or a blessing? They come somewhere between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are a menace when they become so numerous in a small rural community that it virtually dies. That is not a problem peculiar to rural areas of Scotland, but occurs all over the United Kingdom. I urge the Minister again to encourage local authorities and give them the power to try to achieve wholesome communities which balance family homes, retired homes, homes for single people and holiday houses. In that way we can keep communities alive and healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way to do that is to change planning use orders so that an application for a change of use would be required before a property could be used as a holiday home. I get many letters about this problem from the whole of the highlands and islands area. I shall quote from a recent letter from a woman who wrote to me about the
	<br><blockquote><p>"chronic housing shortage for local people in the Highlands and islands in general,"</p></blockquote>
and in her area in particular. She wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our area is sparsely populated and thus, the housing market is naturally, small. This fundamental problem is exacerbated by, firstly, the selling off of council houses with no replacement and, secondly, and more worryingly, the number of properties being bought as holiday houses and retirement homes. This latter not only weakens the chances of local people entering the housing market, especially at the cheaper end of the market, but is also leading to a marked aging of the population."</p></blockquote>
Before moving on, I should like to commend Scottish Homes for the pilot project that it is operating in specific rural areas to help to widen the choice for local people who have limited housing options. I am referring to the rural home ownership grant, which is targeted at those who wish to become owner-occupiers but who are unable to do so because of cost or unavailability in a particular area. I hope that the initiative is successful and will be sustained and extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the debate, the Minister must be keenly aware of the widespread concern about the fact that Scottish Homes is divesting itself of its housing stock and passing it on to other associations or landlords. He should know that there is now a Scottish Homes tenants freedom of choice campaign. In one letter, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In no way does this campaign accept the behaviour and tactics that Scottish Homes are using with their Tenants."</p></blockquote>
That alarms me. All the letters that I have seen from Scottish Homes have indicated that there must be consultation, and so on. The letter continues:
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"You have the RIGHT TO MAKE YOUR CHOICE as you wish and not…be dictated to by Scottish Homes."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will respond to the request made by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) yesterday that he meet the chairman of Scottish Homes to discuss the disposal of its housing stock. There are real problems, which must be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be a responsibility of Government to ensure that people are adequately housed. It was especially interesting that the introductory section of the Minister's earlier comments dealt not with the housing difficulties being experienced by people in Scotland but with his success in sales. He seemed to indicate that the main element of Conservative housing policy is simply to sell off—it is nothing to do with repairs or anything else. It was also interesting that he indicated that there is a clear target of 60 per cent. to be achieved by a certain date. I am not sure whether, once that is achieved, there will be no more sales or whether a new target will be set. None the less, there is a clear numerical target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does not the Minister have clear numerical targets for other elements? Why is there no target for the elimination of dampness? Dampness destroys lives, as the Minister must know. It has an enormous health impact, especially on children who live in damp houses. It affects their whole lives. Dampness affects their ability to get the best from the education system and in many instances, it destroys their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Yet, as far as I know, the Government have no target for the eradication of dampness on Scottish housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to homelessness. I shall comment on the consultative paper in a moment. There is no target for when the Government want to achieve a reduction in homelessness to a specific figure. There are simply good intentions, but nothing more. Why is there not the same emphasis on targeting that aspect as there is on sales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are targets for a reduction in waiting lists in other areas of the Government's work. Why is there no clear target for the reduction of waiting lists in the allocation of public housing, whether by local authorities or other organisations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may pick up the excellent point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn about the merits of security, especially in multi-rise blocks. Why are there no clear targets for making Scotland's houses safe for those who live in them? I should very much like to offer the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South and, indeed, any other Conservative Member the opportunity to see multi-storey buildings in my constituency and elsewhere, where people are happy to live in them. They have good housing, security measures have been arranged, the flats are well maintained and they are ideal for habitation in an urban environment. It is not true that they are residual housing and second best. If there are adequate security arrangements in particular and adequate repairs and maintenance, they are ideal. But why are there no targets set by the Government to ensure that adequate security arrangements will be provided? Why are there no numerical targets for the reduction of vacant housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall let the hon. Gentleman back in shortly. Why are no clear Government targets being established for the reduction of vacant housing in Scotland? Much play was made earlier of the levels of vacant local authority housing. Like many other Opposition Members, I should be happy for those figures to be reduced. However, it is noticeable that the average percentage of rents lost in Scotland—a fair measure of the percentage of vacant housing—has moved from 3.1 per cent. in 1991–92 to 2.8 per cent. in 1992–93 and to 2.5 per cent. in 1993–94. That is much lower than the equivalent percentage of vacant stock under the direct control of the Scottish Office, which at present is 9 per cent. That percentage was given in a ministerial reply in June. When a target is set for reduction in the Scottish Office, it should be applied to the public sector generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Government's target for the percentage of sales, it is often not the case that people are making a choice whether to buy or rent, because the choice is rigged. They are forced to buy because they are making an individual rational choice when rents are deliberately jacked up by the Government. They are making a rational choice within a skewed framework. I know many people in my area—I am sure that many others are in the same position—who would have preferred to have remained tenants of a local authority, but it did not make rational economic sense for them to do so, given that the Government were forcing up rents. That must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On homelessness, I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that the consultation exercise is genuine, unlike many consultations that the Government have been undertaking. I hope that they have not pre-determined the results and are genuinely going to listen to what people have to say. I hope that the Government will make it clear that the right to a home is a basic right and that they have a responsibility to ensure that all Scots have the right to a roof over their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Homelessness is the most acute form of housing need, so homeless people have a justifiable priority need for housing. It is not reasonable for the Government to set the homeless against families in need of housing. We do not want in Scotland the divide and rule mentality adopted by some elements of the Conservative party and some elements of the press in England and Wales. We want everybody in Scotland to be adequately housed. If there are abuses, the Government have a responsibility to draw them to our attention, so that we can examine ways in which difficulties can be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of homeless people to permanent accommodation should not be removed. Temporary accommodation is not sufficient. We must take into account the disruption of family life of a succession of temporary homes. Bed and breakfast accommodation gives children, in particular, no opportunity for a settled environment and no opportunity for settled educational opportunity. The Minister must recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must also accept that while he has aspirations for an increased role for the private sector, the private sector is at present insufficiently developed for it to have a major role in the provision of housing for the homeless. The major burden must remain with the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of more resources. We must make better use of existing stock. I have already touched on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
questions of repairs and of security, and I want to pick up the issue of sheltered housing. One of the ways in which we can help the homeless is by providing additional sheltered housing to free up many of our three, four and five-apartment council or public authority houses that are presently under-occupied by the elderly, who are—entirely reasonably—unwilling to give them up to move to a far distant smaller house, but would be willing to move to sheltered accommodation within their own environment. That requires additional sheltered housing to be built so that they can remain in the communities where they have grown up and spent their fives. They would then be willing to give up the larger houses that are ideally suited to family use. I hope that the Government make it clear that they intend to follow that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the rigging of the market on rent. I hope that the Minister will give us a clear statement that his commitment to choice is sufficient to allow those Scottish Homes' tenants who want to remain in the public sector to do so. If the local authority is sufficiently popular that people want to stay with it, they should be allowed to do so. I could understand the Minister's position if tenants were forced to stay with the local authority against their will. But if it is doing a good job and is more attractive than any other alternative, there should be no artificial rule about a local authority being deemed to have too many houses, so no one else can become a tenant. If the local authority is doing a good job, it should be rewarded for its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Care in the community has a considerable impact on housing. There is a grave danger that that policy is led by the Government's desire to reduce costs in the national health service. The costs that are saved in one area are transferred to local authorities' housing budgets. The Govenment must give a commitment to reconsider the amount of money that they are willing to allow local authorities for funding their part of care in the community. If the existing burdens are added to by cuts in the health service, that will result in a deterioration of the housing stock. There is a grave danger that everyone will become worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to receive a copy of a letter from Glasgow district council signed by the leaders of every political group, including the Conservatives, expressing their concern at how the balance of expenditure was being skewed away from the health service to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two further points to make—first, I refer to energy conservation. As the man responsible for Scotland's housing, the Minister should be prepared to say that money will be made available to local authorities to improve energy conservation methods within our housing stock. Not only would that reduce problems of dampness but it would result in a cut in fuel bills. Given the increase in VAT on fuel, reducing expenditure on energy would be a much more effective and efficient way of spending public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I refer to employment. Expenditure on housing is one of the best ways of generating employment. It is extremely labour intensive, not only in building and repairing houses, but in terms of those who make the materials that are used. Additional expenditure on housing would be one of the best ways of tackling unemployment in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will give us the assurances that we seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the debate. In reply to the hon. Member for Govan, one of the great justifications for the right-to-buy policy is that it has brought no less than £3 billion which has been spent on public sector stock since 1979. Introducing a target will benefit the whole of the rest of the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr made an extremely good speech and he is absolutely right that there must be targeting of resources, which is specifically why we have chosen four strategic priorities. Those are homelessness, dampness, community care and below tolerable-standard stock. That will allow substantial progress to be made, but it would not be appropriate for me to specify detailed figures at local level. That is best left for local councillors to work out priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to stress the importance of the tenants' incentive scheme as one of the many aspects of relieving homelessness. Scottish Homes exceeded its 1993–94 target: this year's target of 200 will be taken forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right to stress the importance of hostels. We have given assistance through housing support grant for any deficits that local authorities may have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the homelessness consultation paper, I assure the hon. Member or Govan that we shall not propose changes until we have had a careful review of responses. We shall be unable to announce decisions about action in Scotland for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the homeless consultation paper, will my hon. Friend assure me that points raised about experiences in Aberdeen city with the allocation of houses for the homeless have been taken account of in that review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, most certainly I also confirm to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Mitchie) that the 1992–93 figures—the latest available—show that those assessed as homeless, or potentially homeless, were 29,900 of which about 11,000 were unintentionally homeless and in priority need. Strategic priority must be given to these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South mentioned the Aberdeen city centre partnership. I intend to visit the city in due course. I stress that a unique spirit of partnership has been established among Scottish Homes, the councils and Grampian Enterprise Ltd. Scottish Homes plans to invest more than £6,500,000 in the city through grant assistance to housing associations, with developers and landlords producing a range of new and improved housing for rent, sale and shared ownership. These involve new housing in Castlegate and The Green, and conversion and improvement of buildings at East North street and Dee street which will be a tremendous uplift for the areas, creating great confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) raised important issues relating to access for disabled persons. I shall study his questions and reply in detail. I can say now that the public sector and the housing association sector had more than 23,000 houses adapted
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
or built for the physically disabled. That represents 2.6 per cent. of their stock and provides an encouraging basis for further development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced on 10 May that the Government will consult on a wide range of measures to help the disabled. We shall consult in Scotland on amendments to the building regulations—a point raised by the hon. Gentleman. A letter was sent to almost 70 organisations in Scotland on 15 June seeking their views on which broad topics should be included in a full consultation paper. This will be introduced in the new year together with a cost compliance assessment. We shall consider all the recommendations of the Ewing committee on housing for people with physical disabilities. I shall study the hon. Gentleman's comments and respond to him in detail.

The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central spoke of spending patterns, which I have already mentioned. The historic spending pattern of the Housing Corporation was originally focused on inner Glasgow, where the housing association movement grew up. However, since 1989, Scottish Homes has promoted the housing association movement throughout Scotland, and it is untrue to suggest otherwise. Spending in Edinburgh increased substantially from £17.7 million to £28.3 million. Priorities shifted. Similarly, there was little housing association movement in rural areas. I raised this with Scottish Homes. Rural investment in Scotland by Scottish Homes is now £60 million, an increase from £41 million. I believe that the traditional priorities for special needs in Glasgow, to which Scottish Homes is committed, are right but its role has widened and it is now an extremely powerful spending body which must make its work relevant to the whole of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the hon. Gentleman and I have other points to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Homes pursues a range of initiatives throughout Scotland. Detailed construction costs vary, but these are matters for that organisation. Its programme has reached a record level and a great many parts of Scotland, including Edinburgh, benefit from it. Its programme must adjust in the light of changing need: the needs and requirements of each part of Scotland will have to be taken legitimately into account. Edinburgh has already received £141 million for the pre-1984 repairs backlog I appreciate the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central about the new backlog Since 1987, Edinburgh district council received mainstream monetary allocations of more than £87 million, in addition to the earmarked resources. Edinburgh has a lower proportion of BTS houses in its total private sector stock, and we expect substantial progress to be made.

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn mentioned the concierge system. I agree that that is a useful way to increase law and order initiatives to reduce crime and make properties more secure in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister continues to say that money is allocated to local authorities by the Government. Will the Minister confirm for the record that the Government give borrowing permission. Local authorities borrow money, and tenants pay back that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
money to the public purse. No money is given to tenants. Everything is now paid back by tenants. The myth must be quashed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a simplistic and not wholly accurate point. What he says does not necessarily apply to all the grants that are given. I have to operate the same system that previous Labour Governments operated Of course local authorities throughout Scotland have borrowed from the private sector when they have spent funds. If the hon. Gentleman wants to change the whole system of spending programmes, he must direct his criticisms against the former Labour Government as well, and he must pursue the matter with the Treasury. He will be taking on an awful lot, and I give him a warning: Harold Macmillan said that he would never take on three groups—the Treasury, the miners and the Pope. The hon. Gentleman has a lot on his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan talked about rents and subsidies. The present Scottish average is only £27.79 per house per week. The increase is less than 5 per cent., which I accept is higher than inflation, but so was the 7.7 per cent. increase in costs of management and maintenance. Last week, the Department published a review of council housing income and expenditure, which showed that, overall, council housing in Scotland is generating a modest but growing financial surplus, much of which is being used to supplement capital spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan mentioned sheltered housing. In 1979, mere were 7,500 sheltered houses, but there are now 32,700. The hon. Gentleman was right to focus on sheltered housing, to which we give priority, and to which Scottish Homes and local authorities will continue to give priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Home's investment programme is now more than £382 million. We regard that as being of great</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>importance. Scottish Homes is carrying out work on 1,200 below tolerable standard properties this year; it is increasing owner occupation by 6,000 units; it is providing 500 new or improved units through its smaller urban renewal initiative; it is enabling 2,000 special needs units, three quarters of which support care in the community; it is providing 2,500 units for the homeless; and it is bringing 500 empty properties back into use this year, which is a substantial step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for smaller urban renewal initiatives to be expanded. They have been successful in Alloa, Kilmarnock, Grangemouth, Hamilton, Airdrie, Vale of Leven, Dumfries, Clydebank, Barrhead, Bellshill and Wishaw. Scottish Homes will invest more than £24 million in SURIs this year, which to date have built or improved around 2,300 homes across Scotland.</p>
	<p>The Government's policies are certain, sure, steady and successful. We are determined to give priority to dealing with dampness. The rate at which we achieve rapid progress will depend on the good will and co-operation that we receive from local authorities and Scottish Homes.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Minister should get his quotations right. Macmillan said that he would not take on the National Union of Mineworkers, the Brigade of Guards or the Roman Catholic church.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
