	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Staff at the House of Commons have to put up with a lot when Committees decide to sit late into the night. Would it be possible to make a dustbin available to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, who is making an unholy mess of the floor on his side of the Committee? Someone has to clear up after him. I know that he does not care about the staffhere, but I do. It would be nice if the hon. Gentleman could put his rubbish in a bin rather than throwing it on the floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that before the Committee comes to an end, the hon. Gentleman will have learnt new ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very appropriate, given the Bill that we are considering, if all members of the Committee had a wastepaper basket.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was sharp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is how I feel about the Bill. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not know whether it was witty, but I meant it. That is where the Bill can go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Robert Peggie implicitly questions whether—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. It is impossible for any of us at this end of the Room to hear my hon. Friend, although we are very interested in what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say that I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman either. There is certainly something wrong with the acoustics in the Room, and there may be something wrong with the microphone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bob Peggie implicitly questions whether the Wheatley and Paterson reports got it so wrong that another reform is necessary now. According to him, the current system of local government does not appear to have any serious symptoms of malaise. That was his considered view when, as ombudsman, he was asked to address the COSLA conference at Dunblane last summer. It is worth asking whether he has changed his mind in the meantime. He gave a very powerful speech, which I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>556</span>
recommend to Ministers. I shall quote a few passages from it. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I took up my post as Chief Executive of Lothian Region in 1974 little did I think that nearly 20 years later I would be standing here today on the threshold of yet another radical re-organisation of Local Government in Scotland. Those of us who have survived the experience would not readily wish to have a 'repeat performance'. Mercifully my brief today does not require me to make comment on the proposals now before you but merely to respond to the question 'What did you do in the great re-organisation of 1975 Grandad'."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of the man who the Government have chosen. He asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What then was the diagnosis and what were the recommended remedies?"</p></blockquote>
He refers to his concern at the
	<br><blockquote><p>"fragmentation of administrative and support services."</p></blockquote>
He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What I am trying to convey here I think is that the lead time towards the 1975 re-organisation was long, and carried out against a background of a growing awareness for the need for change."</p></blockquote>
He contrasts that with the situation today. I shall not try your patience much longer, Sir James. Bob Peggie said at Dunblane:
	<br><blockquote><p>"much of the experience gained by those at the top was lost at vesting time through retiral or an unwillingness to be involved in the new set up."</p></blockquote>
I think that all of us can produce anecdotal evidence of excellent local authority personnel who are just not prepared to face the hassle of yet another change, and I cannot find it in my heart to blame them. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East, who has very close links with many local authority people, knows that that is true. It is true in our area and, I suspect, throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Peggie says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although I could understand the rationale I personally had reason to regret the very restrictive rules laid down for the appointment of staff."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I make no apology for repeating that preparation time for change must be adequate."</p></blockquote>
We must ask whether what we have heard this afternoon and this evening allows enough preparation time for change. Mr. Peggie added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I wish to conclude by posing a question—did Wheatley and Paterson get it wrong to the extent that yet another reorganisation is necessary?"</p></blockquote>
That question more or less answers itself in the speech. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The feeling is that the patient does not appear to have any serious symptoms of malaise."</p></blockquote>
Even so, he noted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The patient is back in the operating theatre, gowns and masks have been donned, and scalpels are held at the ready."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Peggie ended by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, when the organs are moved around and the wounds stitched up, it is to be hoped that the period of recuperation will not be too lengthy and that the patient can reasonably look forward to a long, healthy and useful life."</p></blockquote>
I think that we have already discovered that the Bill's geological flaws mean that the reforms cannot last and are not worth the candle. I urge the Government to consider their appointee's considered speech at Dunblane last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the chance of contributing to the debate.

the Member for Linlithgow has said. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Sir James, I have what in Scotland is called the sixth sense and know what is being said from afar. I thought that the Committee would enjoy a blow-by-blow account of last Sunday's events at Easter road—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) apparently would find that distressing, and you, Sir James, might call it out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak about the period of time in which the chairman and the other members of the staff commission will spend on the very imporant matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. I have the greatest respect for Bob Peggie. He is a Hearts supporter, like me. He was a superb chief executive of Lothian regional council—impartial, reasonable and knowledgeable. Since then he has done an exceptional job as local government commissioner. I have had occasion to refer a number of cases to the office of the local government commissioner—or ombudsman, as he is known colloquially—and they have been dealt with efficiently and effectively. The decisions have always been impartial, reasonable and sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I have crossed swords from time to time. Indeed, he became very agitated at something that I said. I did not understand why, when all I said was that he and the Kyle and Carrick Tory group were working in cahoots. I expected the Minister to take as a compliment a remark that he was working closely with the Conservative majority in a local authority. My only complaint concerned the result of their work. Even so, notwithstanding my disagreements with the Minister, I repeat what I said in an intervention: I compliment the Minister on the appointment of Bob Peggie as chairman of the advisory committee in the interim and of the staff commission in the longer term. He will bring to the job deep knowledge and understanding of local government. Later, I shall talk about the speech to which my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spent the past hour or more talking to my old colleagues on Lothian council, including the convener, Eric Milligan—who is a fellow Hearts supporter—and councillor Elizabeth McGuinness, the chairman of the education committee. By coincidence, she also supports Hearts, despite her name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggests that promotion in Lothian regional council depends on the football team that councillors support. Is some sort of skullduggery going on in Lothian regional council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Definitely not. Although my hon. Friend represents a Dundee constituency, he avidly supports one of the old firm teams—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And it is not Rangers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend rightly says, it is not Rangers. There is no skullduggery in Lothian regional council. Although I talked to Eric Milligan and Elizabeth McGuinness for more than an hour, we did not discuss Hearts' great victory at Easter road last weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>558</span>
We discussed local government reorganisation. We know Bob Peggie well. We know about his expertise and his local government background. But one day a week is not enough. The Minister compared the 1974–75 reorganisation with the current proposals. He claims that the proposals constitute a minor reorganisation when compared with that of the 1970s. That is a major misjudgment. As we examine the Bill in detail, the difficulties, complexities and problems that reorganisation will cause become more apparent. I urge the Minister to spend time seriously reconsidering the arrangements for the staff advisory committee and the staff commission. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central said earlier, our amendments draw attention to the many problems that are likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow referred to Bob Peggie's speech at the COSLA conference in Dunblane. I welcome Bob Peggie's appointment. The Minister said that he was a man of impeccable credentials and long experience in local government. Therefore, it is devastating for the Government to examine the speech that Bob made in 1993 in Dunblane. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The feeling is that the patient does not appear to have any serious symptoms of malaise."</p></blockquote>
The Government not only administer doses of medicine, they cut up the patient, although he has no apparent illness, no problems and no difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman concede that he has been an arch critic of Strathclyde?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I challenge the hon. Member for Ayr to name one occasion on which I have criticised Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt I have picked up that impression from numerous press articles. However, I cannot name an occasion. I simply asked a question and I accept the hon. Member's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr says things and then withdraws them. Last week he apologised before he had even said anything—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should return to the amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir James. I have not been a critic of Strathclyde. On occasions, when Strathclyde has proposed a matter for consultation, as it did with Castle Hill, I used my democratic opportunity to say that I disagree with the proposal. That does not mean that I oppose Strathclyde as a structure or what it is doing—quite the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the staff commission and the chairman-elect who said in Dunblane in 1993:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The feeling is that the patient does not appear to have any serious symptoms of malaise".</p></blockquote>
Why, therefore, are we treating the patient? Why this huge reorganisation? As hour after hour and day after day passes on this Committee I am increasingly coming to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>559</span>
conclusion that we are wasting our time. We should not be going through this process of reorganisation at this time and in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was fortified in my view earlier today when I was given more information about what is happening in England where it is increasingly likely that there will be no reorganisation of local government. The Government are getting deeper into the glaur, the mud and the mire in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are we talking about appointing a chairman of the staffcommission and about his remit and the powers and the terms of reference of the commission if, as I suspect, a few weeks from now when things grind to a halt in England there will be serious doubt about whether we should press ahead with reorganisation in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my sense of alarm at the difficulties of what I can only call the East Anglian mafia—many of whom hold important positions in the Government—in their own back yard in respect of the proposal to abolish Norfolk county council? It is salutory for the Government Chief Whip and some Cabinet Ministers to know what mayhem they are letting loose on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir James, with his Ulster cough, is indicating that I should not go too far in response to my hon. Friend's point. I agree with my hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no staff commission in England because the review is in an almost terminal mess. Hon. Members, including the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with responsibility for Europe, has apparently told the press that he will vote against the Government if they bring forward proposals based on the findings of the review. Not only will there be no staffcommission, it is unlikely that there will be any reorganisation of local government down south.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has there ever been a more ignorant statement than that from the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland? Of course there is a staff commission in England. Its chairman is Mr. Alan Atherton and the commission is up and operating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I call Mr. Foulkes to speak on the Staffcommission for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what has been said, I am wiser to stick to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman-designate of the Staff Commission for Scotland, in the speech to which my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow referred, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I wish to conclude by posing a question—did Wheatley and Paterson get it wrong to the extent that yet another re-organisation is necessary?"</p></blockquote>
I was a member of the Paterson committee. Another member was a councillor Tosh, although not Murray Tosh. It was another Tosh from Dundee. The Paterson committee spent a long time looking at the entire
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>560</span>
organisation and management structure of local government in Scotland. We followed on from Wheatley. Wheatley looked at the global structure and the question of one or two tiers, the estuarial principle and the optimum size for service delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paterson dealt with the nitty gritty and the way in which the staff were disposed. We came up with the concept of the chief executive and corporate management in local government structure. It is not clear whether the corporate management system of chief executive, directors of planning and directors of policy planning in some local authorities will continue under the new system because we seem to be moving away from the larger authorities which I like such as Ayrshire and Lothian. Those strategic authorities are big enough to deliver the services. I suspect that we shall move away from corporate management. How will the staff deal with that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a number of authorities have developed corporate structures. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) knows them well. They will have chief executives, directors of policy planning and so on. A new authority may be minimalist like Kyle and Carrick or Stirling and may not have or wish to have all those structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes what he is saying, why did he vote to make two new, relatively small, local authorities even smaller?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: East Renfrewshire and Argyll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not do that. I was keen to move Crofthead house out of East Renfrewshire. That is all that I argued for strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will realise that the Minister is talking about the votes to take Barrhead, Uplawmoor, Neilston and Ralston out of Eastwood and put them into the new Renfrew authority. We made it clear that we wanted to do that because the Minister told us that small authorities would work. It is clear that those boundaries were drawn in that area simply to justify the Eastwood district council as it stands becoming a unitary authority. We told the Minister that if that is what he wanted he should take Eastwood and go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one could explain and deal with the Minister's intervention better than my hon. Friend. To return to these corporate management structures—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend refers to corporate management structures which will undoubtedly be interesting, does he realise that, in arguing that parts of these small authorities should not be taken away because they may then become unviable, the Minister cannot now take anything away from the present Stirling district should he decide to retain the Stirling proposal for central Scotland. We therefore do not expect to find any devious moves to remove the mining villages and stick them into Clackmannan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Minister was trying to be quite clever in his intervention. He is a clever Minister. He was trying to trip me up, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>561</span>
he may trip himself up in future. He should be careful with his interventions because if he is challenging me about small authorities, which is an illegitimate, invalid unfounded and unwanted challenge, he may find himself, as he has in the past, in difficulty on subsequent amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister intervenes, I inform the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that I have been waiting eagerly to learn much about the staff commission in Scotland. He has been led astray by his hon. Friends and the Minister. He should return to discussing the staff commission, so that I can find out what it is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir James. You are absolutely right. I have been led astray, and the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By his comments as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a lesser extent. The Minister is the most culpable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with authorities that have chief executives, deputy chief executives, assistant chief executives, directors of planning and directors of policy planning. In addition, Sir James—you greatly deserve that title, but I keep thinking of you in other more familiar terms—the authorities deal with corporate management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Minimalist authorities will not have all these directorates because they will not need them. They will adopt the Westminster strategy or the Wandsworth strategy. All that they need, apart from a clerk and a director of administration, is a director of handing out services to private contractors or a director of contracts. The central administration will be slimmed down, which will have severe implications for the staff commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how the staff commission will cope with the move from large strategic authorities, which have a desire to provide services directly, to smaller authorities—heaven forbid, one or two may be Tory controlled—which want to be minimalist authorities with a small central administration. That will create difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that there will be those difficulties, why did he vote to make Argyll smaller than the Government proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not vote for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, you did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No,I did not. I want to make that absolutely clear. The Minister is leading me down the garden path again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have every faith that the hon. Member will not be tempted down that path.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that, first, we were in favour of the existing scheme. That is what we voted
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>562</span>
for, and we made it clear that we did not want any change now. Secondly, we made it clear that, if there are to be changes, we want large strategic authorities. Since then, all our subsequent amendments have tried to improve and tidy up some of the nonsense that the Government have created. However, that does not mean that we think that our amendments are ideal. We are on our third option, which is to tidy up the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to consideration of the staff commission and to deal with education. The Bill suggests that there is no need for an education committee, a director of education, or an education structure. How will the staff commission deal with directors of education and their staff when they are transferred from the old authorities to the new authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also been told that there is no need for directors of social work or social work departments. How will the commission deal with the transfer of administration of social work from the old authorities, which are enthusiastic about it and have the necessary staff, to the new authorities, which do not want a director of social work and intend to include social work in the provision for leisure and recreation or for cemeteries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Tayside regional council has a committed social work department, with a director and assistant directors of social work. Of the three successor authorities, I can guarantee that if Dundee authority is controlled by Labour it will have a social work committee, an education committee and directors of education and social work, but the same cannot be said of the new Perth and Kinross council or of the new Angus council. We are not convinced that they will appoint directors of education and social work and replace all the functions in the smaller councils. Therefore, some people are bound to be made redundant. The terms and conditions of their compensation are vital. The Minister says that that should be left to him, but that is the last thing the Committee should do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend has put more eloquently than I ever could the point that I was trying to make and used the example of Tayside, which he knows so well. He emphasises my point: there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister beetles his brow: I have seen that beetled brow on so many previous occassions. He does not appreciate the seriousness of the debate. It would be all right if we were transferring services to and from authorities of roughly the same size that have the same desire to deliver services and the same strategic understanding of that service delivery because directors and assistant directors of education and other services could be appointed and people would move from divisional offices to the new councils to deal with similar services, but that might not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to deal with another sentence from Mr. Peggie's speech. I ask the Minister to bear in mind that this is the man for whom we both have great respect and whom he has just appointed as chairman designate of the staff commission. Mr. Peggie says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I make no apology for repeating that preparation time for change must be adequate."</p></blockquote>
I am worried that Bob Peggie and his fellow staff commission members will be rushing through their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>563</span>
important task, on which depends the future of thousands of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From all the nice and sound things that the hon. Gentleman said about Mr. Peggie, my impression is of a man would not take on a task that he felt was beyond him but would take on a task with which he felt comfortable and which he could carry out diligently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that he will carry out his task diligently. He is also a man of sufficient integrity and independence to ask the Minister for extra time and resources, for more leeway and for changes in the regulations if, after a week of two or a month or two, he discovered that some of the problems facing him were too great. I am certain that he will do that. Today, I am predicting that he will make suggestions for particular areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech Mr. Peggie said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although I could understand the rationale I personally had reason to regret the very restrictive rules laid down for the appointment of staff."</p></blockquote>
We must examine that in more detail. When he considers the rule for the appointment of staff, I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind. I hope that the staff commission will be allowed to make recommendations for exercising freedom and flexibility so that we shall not experience the rigidity that we had last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perhaps my penultimate point—my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East will understand what I am talking about. Mr. Peggie says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"much of the experience gained by those at the top was lost at vesting time through retiral or an unwillingness to be involved in the new set up."</p></blockquote>
Many of my hon. Friends have been involved in local government: my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), for Dundee, East, for Falkirk, East, for Fife, Central and even for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who was a distinguished councillor from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should include the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, with whom I sparred across the council chamber. I am glad that I was not sparring with him in the boxing ring; someone who has a boxing Oxford blue is not the sort of person to spar with in the boxing ring. Indeed, the hon. Member for Angus, East was the Provost of Angus in the old days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Bromley, who was a distinguished Bromley councillor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way, although I was not leaping to my feet to get that point on the record. In his tribute to everyone on the Committee, surely the hon. Gentleman should not omit my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who had a long and most distinguished record in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>564</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to mention the hon. Member for Dumfries and I am glad that he is with us in fair health today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us involved in local government would agree that, during the reorganisation, we do not want to lose some of the experience at the top. That is the danger and the worry. I ask the Minister to take this point, if nothing else, seriously. Some people at the top of local government, particularly in the regions, have valuable experience. People working in Strathclyde region have been directors, deputy directors and assistant directors of major departments. People at the top of the Lothian region, whom I know well, have vast and brilliant experience in local government. It would be catastrophic to local government in Scotland if we lost them, yet they will have to look around for posts in what will inevitably be smaller authorities, with diminished responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. It is important that we make arrangements to encourage people to stay in local government. There is a temptation to have attractive arrangements to get them to retire early and move on in order to introduce younger people, but it would be very sad if such people, with their great experience, were lost to local government in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Boundary Commission changes the boundaries, hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the inordinate interest that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you, Sir James and 	<i>Hansard</i> will confirm that, when I have been talking, uninterrupted, I have been absolutely on the ball and in order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

diverted down the blind alleys that you, so rightly, try to get me out of, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made my penultimate point, I shall now come to my final point. [HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] Conservative Members would like me to go on longer, but I can always intervene again. The basic message that I am trying to get across is that perhaps fortuitously, by accident or by grand design—that, I cannot fathom—the Minister has had the wisdom and the sense to appoint an interim chairman. I hope that I have not done his future career any harm by quoting him so extensively and praising him so widely. The Minister has appointed an independent person who has some thoughts of his own. I hope that, having appointed him, the Minister will pay some attention to the wise points that he made in Dunblane at the COSLA conference in 1993. Some of my hon. Friends have said how true his comments were, even today. I hope that the Minister, even if not in reply to this debate, will respond to the points that I have made in my very brief speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the debate. I thought that the hon. Member for Angus, East was about to move his amendment, but it appears that he is not interested in doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to do that formally. The amendment involves democracy and accountability, to which the Minister is a stranger, if the Bill is anything to go by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not criticising the hon. Member for Angus, East, it is entirely up to him whether he moves his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot move the amendment at the moment because we are debating amendment No. 96, which was moved by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. When that is dealt with, if the hon. Member for Angus, East wishes to do so he may move his amendment. He can speak to it, which is perhaps what the Minister was suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are, of course, absolutely correct, Sir James. I paused momentarily because I thought that the hon. Member for Angus, East wished to speak to his amendment, which is grouped with amendment No. 96. But that is entirely a matter for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, the appointee, Mr. Peggie, has independent views, for which we do not criticise him. I attended the COSLA conference in Dunblane and announced that there would be a staff commission. I spoke to the conference: with my customary humility I have to admit that Mr. Peggie's speech was better received than mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shadow Secretary of State made an astonishing statement in this debate. He said that there is no staff commission in England, but the staff commission in England is up and running. If the hon. Gentleman does not know that, he shows an astonishing ignorance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is always magnanimous. Surely he will admit that until he was slipped a piece of paper telling him that, he was agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>566</span>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I was not agreeing with the hon. Gentleman, but I admit that the first name of the chairman had escaped my memory momentarily. I had forgotten that it was the same as my own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us when the body was set up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was set up under the Local Government Act 1992 and has been in operation in relation to the Isle of Wight in particular. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not recall my reference to the number of councillors recommended for the Isle of Wight. My memory is that I pointed out that the number recommended was to be cut from 100 to 48. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is important that the Minister is heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman hung on my every word, he would know about such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the staff commission deciding how many councillors there should be in the Isle of Wight? What has that to do with staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. My points are directly related. The position in England in some respects is much further advanced than that in Scotland because there is a rolling programme, and that programme has started. Decisions have been made about the number of councillors in some areas of England, but not others. A staff commission had to be up and running in England because the process is underway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Gentleman is trying to delay me, but as he is wearing a blue shirt, I will certainly give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a low blow. The Minister clearly intimated that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian was unaware of the existence of a staff commission in England and cited the reduction in the number of councillors in the Isle of Wight from 100 to about 40 as evidence that he knew of such a commission. In reality, the Minister was referring to the Boundary Commission for England, not the staff commission. He was unaware of the existence of a staff commission and, as my hon. Friend said, was made aware of it in a note that was given to him by his civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I look at the various notes that I have received and see no such note. I admit that the first name of the chairman of the staff commission in England, Mr. Atherton, escaped me momentarily. I should have remembered that his first name is the same as mine. Knowledgeable as I am about the English staff commission, I am not aware that the chairman is a Hearts supporter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must now refer specifically to the amendments. Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 are surprising because they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>567</span>
remove any obligation on the Secretary of State to undertake consultations before establishing a staff commission. I accept that that effect may be intended. I regard such consultation as an important part of the process of setting up a staff commission. I shall not speak to amendment No. 117, which stand in the name of the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) because he has not spoken to it yet. If he discusses the matters dealt with by that amendment, I shall respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98 would tie the staff commission to the list of functions laid down in the Bill, which would remove any flexibility to adjust those functions to meet changes in circumstances. I should have thought that Opposition Members would support a degree of flexibility in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This refers back to a point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow in his intervention about the functions of the staff commission as set out in the Bill compared with those in the 1973 Act. Clause 12(2) gives a clear indication of the commission's functions, while leaving the discretion to add to or vary them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions listed in the clause repeat those in the 1973 Act, with the addition of the power for the commission to provide advice to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is dealing with the important list of functions to be carried out by the staff commission. Will he consider adding an additional duty—namely, that the staff should monitor the costs of the reform and produce a definitive report within three years? It should deal with the cost of implementing the provisions between clauses 8 and 12 in terms of their introduction, the transitional period and the first three years of operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would take the staff commission outside its remit. However, the Bill gives the Secretary of State power by order to add additional functions to those carried out by the commission. There is a degree of flexibility, although the additional functions would have to relate specifically to staffing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an embarras de richesses. As the hon. Gentleman is wearing the same tie as me, I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a very communautaire comment. The Minister is speaking about the staff commission, which will have the job of completing this very costly game of musical chairs by All Fools day 1996. I notice that today he gave a reply to a question from his very assiduous hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, suggesting that on All Fools day 1997 construction and property services and internal accounting will be subject to compulsory competitive tendering. What is the point of going through the motions of getting people reallocated into new posts only to privatise them a year later? Does it not make sense to do both things at once?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have changed the timetable on the extension of CTC to defer it until after the reorganisation. We have done so in response to representations received from local authorities, which I hope will, in part, counter
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>568</span>
the criticisms that the Government do not listen or respond positively to sensible representations from local authorities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that we shall certainly listen carefully to advice that we receive on what other functions the commission might undertake, but they would have to relate specifically to staffing matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 156 and 157 specify the functions of the staff commission. As I understand it, their intention is to ensure that both the Secretary of State and authorities have the benefit of advice from the staff commission before transfer orders are made or amended. I realise that transfer and compensation arrangements are two areas of great concern and interest to local government. It was always our intention fully to involve the commission in these and other important matters, although I should say that it may be desirable to reach decisions about compensation regulations soon—possibly before the commission has a chance to consider them fully, because the commission cannot be set up until the Bill has received Royal Assent. I can re-assure hon. Members that we are initiating discussions on the issue with COSLA, and I hope to receive advice from the staff advisory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be little point in having a staff commission that did not involve itself in crucial issues such as those mentioned in the hon. Gentleman's amendments. I do not dispute the intention behind the amendments, but, as drafted, they would narrow considerably the staff commission's area of operations. I shall expand a little on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would constrain the staff commission to considering matters related to staff who are transferred, and remove its role for staff who are appointed rather than transferred. I doubt that that was the hon. Gentleman's intention and, because of that difficulty, I am unable to accept his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 158 relates to the Secretary of State's powers to refer staffing problems to the staff commission. I am surprised that the effect of the amendment would be that the Secretary of State would be expected to appoint a body to advise him on staffing issues but be prevented from inviting that body to consider staffing problems. The amendment appears to assume that the staff commission will operate in a sort of enclosure to which only the Secretary of State will have access. That is not so. It is an important point of principle. The staff commission will be there to listen to the concerns of local authorities, staff and employers, and to act on them. I do not believe that Opposition Members intended to exclude any of the major players from the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that it is in the best interests of staff that there be appropriate consultation on the commission's operation. We are committed to that.We want the commission to be able to operate as widely as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the commission say who will be members of the commission and by what criteria they will be chosen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As hon. Members know, we have announced the name of the commission's chairman, and other members' names will be announced before 1 April,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>569</span>
when the staff advisory committee will be up and running. Obviously we are looking for people with appropriate experience in local government or personnel matters who also have the necessary objectivity and experience. We have specifically asked COSLA and the Scottish Trades Union Congress for nominations and we have had nominations from bodies such as the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, the CBI in Scotland, and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made clear what the commission's role will be. It seems right to allow the commission to adapt its role to meet unforeseen circumstances and to handle staffing problems referred to it by the Secretary of State. It should also have the flexibility that the clause as drafted would provide.

It is a view common to both sides of the Committee that the staff of a local authority are its most important asset. It is precisely to protect that asset that we propose to establish a staff commission. Its primary role will be to look after the interests of staff throughout the transition to the new authorities. It will offer advice—both to the Secretary of State and to local authorities—on all issues that will be of concern to staff, including transfer orders, appointments and compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend expand on the compensation arrangements that might apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have outlined a timetable regarding compensation arrangements, which will be one of the most important functions of the staff commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission will monitor the arrangements for the transfer and recruitment of staff and, essentially, act as an honest broker when differences of view arise, as they are bound to in any large reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe, therefore, that the amendments would help in the process, despite my recognition of—and, in some respects, my agreement with—the motivation behind some of them. The nomination of Mr. Robert Peggie as chairman of the advisory committee, and then the staff commission, has received widespread support and I hope that that will signify to everyone in local government the Government's good faith in dealing with the important matter of staffing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, while the Minister has made some reasoned comments, and while we would not argue with the views that have been attributed to the chairman-designate of the staff commission, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>570</span>
assurances that we have been given have not gone far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendments because we were anxious to include in the Bill certain items so that there would no confusion, no uncertainties and no ambiguities about the commission's role. We also wanted to curtail the Secretary of State's powers. The aim is not to divorce the Secretary of State from the commission's work—that would be extremely foolish—but to try to tip the balance of fairness away from the Secretary of State to the commission itself. That is why we have argued consistently for an independent commission. It could be independent only if the Secretary of State were willing to give up some of the powers that he seeks under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the chairman-designate is a good choice. We have yet to find out who the other members of the commission will be. Indeed, a later amendment relates to that issue. We should not want our comments to be misconstrued to the extent that it might be thought that the chairman-designate would have difficulty obtaining our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are loose ends about the issues of independence, primary legislation and the curtailment of powers. Therefore, we wish to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is about compensation. The amendment would inject new subsections and incorporate section 220 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
The amendment's purpose is to enable an employee aged 50 or more at the date of reorganisation to elect to retire and to benefit from the maximum number of added years under the Local Government (Compensation for Premature Retirement) (Scotland) Regulations 1979 and the Local Government (Compensation for Redundancy and Premature Retirement) (Scotland) Regulations 1994. The amendment deals with an issue that will undoubtedly arise on clause 13. We seek clarification from the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also wish to ensure that those people aged between 45 and 50 receive not preferential treatment, but consistency of treatment given the difficulties that might ensue in the transfer process. We want to clarify what compensation will be available against the background of the complex regulations on superannuation. We seek the Government's good will, so that, if an official needs to retire early, the maximum opportunities are provided on a level playing field. No official should be discriminated against on the grounds of age if he does not qualify now for the most substantial compensation payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond positively, especially in view of the decisions that we have taken on the setting up of the staff commission and on the transfer arrangements. Those decisions were not to our liking, but they will become reality if the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a long amendment, but it would provide reassurance to those staff of 50 and over and between 45 and 50 who may play an important part in the transition process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish of me not to thank the Minister and his officials for his letter of 22 February about the residuary bodies about which I tabled questions on Thursday. It will be gone over with a magnifying glass and a toothcomb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are treading on eggshells in this clause, which relates to compensation for loss of office and the diminution of emoluments. This is a delicate subject. I have already referred to the need to protect staff job security within the terms of the Bill. It is inevitable that some staff will wish to leave local government service under early retirement or voluntary redundancy regulations. The interests of those staff must also be protected, and I shall ask the Minister four questions on the matter. He should be grateful for small mercies: I could put 10 questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in previous reorganisations, including the last local government reorganisation in Scotland, the abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan counties, special compensation arrangements were established for eligible staff who lost employment as a result of reorganisation. Does the Minister accept that similar special arrangements should apply in this reorganisation? I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell), a former chairman of Yorkshire metropolitan authority, that this is an important and delicate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does the Minister agree that the special compensation arrangements referred to in my previous question should be provided for in primary legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the established regulations for compensatory payments allow each local authority to exercise its discretion on the level of compensation payable to eligible employees. Does the Minister agree that, to avoid
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
inconsistencies and ensure equality of treatment, the special compensation arrangements must require all local authorities to provide the same level of compensation and that that level should be the maximum payable under the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the established regulations in respect of pension payments for employees who lose their employment relate only to employees aged 50 years or over. Does the Minister agree that there is a case for extending the special compensation arrangements in respect of pension payments to include employees under the age of 50?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are too important to be omitted from the Bill; there will be uncertainty and anxiety if they are not included. There must be fair and equitable compensation arrangements for staff who have given long and loyal service to local government who do not have a future in the new structure. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider these important questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Members for Linlithgow and for Fife, Central about the importance of those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of powers, I understand from our legal advisers that there is no need to include a specific power in this Bill enabling the Secretary of State to make a particular compensation scheme for staff affected by reorganisation. Such a scheme can be provided under section 24 of the Superannuation Act 1972. I appreciate that a separate scheme was contained in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, but that was probably because the Superannuation Act 1972 had gone through Parliament only in the previous year. I assure the Committee that a satisfactory compensation scheme could be provided under section 24 of the Superannuation Act 1972. There is no need for new primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow raised the matter of the compensation package. We shall consult a wide range of interested parties before taking decisions on compensation. We shall discuss the matter with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, with the representatives of local authority employees and with the staff advisory committee.

I assure the Committee that I have noted the serious points made by hon. Members in the debate. My view is that the statutory framework is sufficient and we shall discuss the details of compensation packages with employers' and employees' representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friends the Members for Fife, Central and Linlithgow that there must be fair compensation for employees who are displaced or who have to take early retirement as a consequence of the reorganisation. I want to know who will pay for it. If people resent paying their council tax even for valuable services, they will resent it even more if they have to pay for people to do nothing, which is how it might appear to some. Will the cost be part of the transitional costs referred to in the explanatory and financial memorandum? Will it be paid for by the Treasury from the Scottish Office budget by displacing some other item or by council tax payers of the successor authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is yes, the costs will be part of the transitional costs in the estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the costs will be part of the transitional costs. Will they be paid by central Government or by successor authorities from their council tax revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question relates to our long discussion earlier. I refer the hon. Gentleman to a statement made by the Secretary of State about transitional costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the discussions with COSLA likely to take place before the end of the Committee stage or at least before Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are anxious to pursue discussions with COSLA. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not anticipate that the discussions will be completed before Report, but we are anxious to hold early discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow raised an important issue in this detailed and complex amendment, which relates to the compensation arrangements for valued employees. We are discussing compensation arrangements, mandatory rather than discretionary payments, the distinction between employees aged over and under 50, and about mechanisms for those electing to retire. Will the Minister give us a final assurance that these matters will be fully discussed with local authority associations and that the points made by COSLA will be reflected in the Bill and—it is equally important—in any orders and regulations from the Secretary of State which may be part of the work of the staff commission? If we had that firm assurance, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member that we will take the discussions with COSLA and with the employees' representatives extremely seriously and report to Parliament when discussions have been completed. However, as I said, I do not believe that changes to primary legislation are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the Minister's assurance will be followed through. I shall withdraw the amendment, but in view of its importance, I ask that the point be seriously noted.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, there was no similar provision in the 1973 Act. Will the Minister give a brief justification of clause 14?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 14 is a response to concerns that were expressed at the time of the 1975 reorganisation and subsequently. There was a perception that some staff had benefited significantly by collecting redundancy compensation at the time of the abolition of the old authorities only to be employed subsequently by a new authority in such a way that they kept their redundancy money. It is difficult to produce specific evidence of such practice, but there is reason to justify taking action to discourage it. That is what clause 14 is all about</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That problem was greatly exaggerated. Some of what was said was in the fairy-tale category.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to have been an exhilarating burst of speed in dealing with clauses and amendments, which must be to the delight of the Government Whip. However, I intend to apply a little deceleration to discuss the important subject of property. Property is a major asset of local government. It represents a past and present investment. Property is used symbolically and functionally in the everyday work of departments. It is essential to the continuing work of local authorities and during the transfer there will be a need for changes—new properties will have to be gathered and old properties disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Property is a major part of Scotland's heritage and, therefore, it should be treated with the greatest respect. It has been paid for by past generations of local government taxpayers. The Government will be judged by their attitude to this vast local government resource. There is a great fear that there will be a sale of the century of local government property in an attempt to bankroll the Government's changes. I hope that the fear is not turned into reality. The idea of property in local government deserves better treatment than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great desire among local government officials and those connected with local government to maintain the highest standards of care, maintenance and improvement of public buildings. Scotland has a great deal to be proud of in the way that local authorities have been involved in such activities. Public buildings are assets in every town, burgh and city throughout Scotland. Local government has a proud record of ensuring that such buildings are major continuing assets for the public to enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A massive range of buildings owned and operated by local authorities is involved in property transactions, such as schools, halls, community centres and museums. They are an integral part of every local community. That is what is important about the amendment and the Government's approach to property in the reorganisation. I know at first hand that there is a sense of pride and professionalism in the work of property purchase, control and maintenance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>580</span>
throughout the local authorities of Scotland. The changes must not be allowed to affect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides for the creation of a central property management facility within the management structures of the new authorities. Its purpose would be to require any such new residual body to establish a central property management facility within its internal management structures to oversee the procurement, maintenance and care of property within its ownership to appropriate professional standards. I stress the word "professional" because national assets, which are held locally on behalf of our communities, must be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a pride and professionalism in local authority architect and property departments. I do not want there to be a deterioration of such standards after the reorganisation. I hope that the Minister agrees that professionalism must always be stressed. The present high standards of local authorities must be maintained and built on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of public properties must also be considered, which is why amendment No. 151 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"the social, community, and administrative policies of the new authorities."</p></blockquote>
Community assets should remain as such, not be sold off to make quick money that would be recycled to suit the Government's reorganisation. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind as the reorganisation approaches. Buildings should be used for their original, public purposes, not as a means of gaining easy revenue or capital funds. They were created by local authority taxpayers for public use. That is how they should stay. If there is a sell off the public good will suffer. Who decides what constitutes surplus assets and who can sell them off? That is crucial to what will happen after reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151 deals with local authority property as a community asset and as it is used to meet those community needs. The amendments ask the Minister how he sees existing property of local authorities. Are they community assets or simply something to be bought and sold? What does he see as the role of the residuary body? How does he intend to constitute it and how will it operate? What is the role he will lay on this residuary body? Under what criteria will it operate? The amendments seek clarification of the Government's intentions on property in their reorganisation plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put in a specific plea about common good. I seek positive reassurances about common good funds because they are crucial throughout Scotland. They are past assets which must continue to be used for the local good in the communities to which they were given. That is why people in the past were quite happy to give bequests for the common good of local communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can genuinely reassure the hon. Gentleman. There are legal problems with the amendments but he says that he puts them forward in the spirit of inquiry. I can certainly reassure him about the common good. The clause provides for common good property to transfer under similar arrangements to those which applied at the 1975 reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general the amendments seek to ensure that management of property is carried out to the highest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>581</span>
standards by residuary bodies. I fully concur with that aim. The need for and role of residuary bodies will need to be the subject of consultation with local authorities closer to the time of reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously it would be much simpler and easier for new authorities if property could transfer directly to the new councils. In such a scenario there would be no role for a residuary body in property management. Clearly, it is important that whatever public body holds or manages property, it does so in line with best practice and the high standards expected by the taxpayer of any public organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the hon. Member for Angus, East that any residuary body with a responsibility for property will have a duty to fulfil that responsibility with due regard to value for money and other good practice considerations. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a bit of a difficulty here. In his letter of 22 February which the Minister kindly sent he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should preface my response to this question, and indeed to questions 2, 3 and 4, by stating that, without anticipating the outcome of any debate we may have on clause 18 and Schedule 3, no decision has yet been taken as to whether any residuary bodies will be required."</p></blockquote>
In his answer to the hon. Member for Angus, East he made a definite reference to residuary bodies. This needs to be cleared up. I may have got the wrong end of the stick at twenty past eleven at night but there seems to be discrepancy between what was written in this considered letter of 22 February and the answer that the Minister has just given. I do not make too much of that. My hon. Friends and I will return for time and a half on the whole question of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask two questions of principle. Do the Government think that it is necessary for headquarters to be sited in the area of the authority for which it purports to be the headquarters? A problem exists, which I must call the Buchan problem. I understand from Richard Blackburn that people in the north-east are upset at the idea of having to go from country areas into the city of Aberdeen to a headquarters that is not in the area of which it is headquarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not just a hypothetical question. Some of us have many years experience of Midlothian county council whose headquarters was in the centre of Edinburgh. That created resentment and great inconvenience in Midlothian. An issue of principle is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of the Government assuming that existing faculties will mirror, by magic, the needs of the new authorities. That will not happen. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East will consider at length the issue of Falkirk and Stirling, but that example can be mirrored throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar situation will be found in Edinburgh and Lothian region—I shall put this on the record and then shut up. On the assumption that the new authorities will wish all their staff to be located within their boundaries, an even greater number of staff will be required to transfer from Edinburgh to the landward areas. That will leave much surplus accommodation in the city, which the director of property services considers to be virtually impossible to sell or lease, given its location and character.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>582</span>
The idea that great profits can be made from local authority accommodation is absolute eyewash given the current state and demands of the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new landward authorities will require additional accommodation to house their headquarters staff for services such as education, social work and highways, as well as the increase in the central support staff who will transfer from regional headquarters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the former county council of Midlothian whose headquarters was outside the county, in the city of Edinburgh. The offices of the current Midlothian district council transferred just three or four years ago. As it did not have its own headquarters, part of the deal on establishing Lothian regional council was that Lothian had to make available funds for building in Dalkeith new headquarters for Midlothian district council. The Bill will amalgamate Midlothian and East Lothian. Goodness knows where the headquarters for that new council will be. That matter is very complicated territory. Perhaps Dover house will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter is indeed complicated territory. The Minister must give some answers on Thursday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My amendments are exploratory, and I am sure that we shall return to the matter. I echo the point of the hon. Member for Linlithgow. There is great concern that it could be disastrous if many properties are unleashed on an already depressed property market. It must be organised properly to mitigate damage. If much local government property were unleashed on local property markets, it could be deleterious to local economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister mean by consultation with local authorities, specifically consultation about property? I thank him for his appreciation of the importance of property to local authorities and to the reorganisation. However, I must put to him again that a central property management facility would help to manage the task, especially in a professional, organised way. I have asked him to comment on whether he accepts or rejects the idea of a central property management facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Minister's remarks about the common good funds. I have seen common good funds in operation, and they are a tremendous asset to communities. People were worried about whether they would be safeguarded in the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask specifically about the central property management facility as an idea for the organisation of the proper conduct of property transfer and shifts and changes arising from reorganisation. I also want to ask about the danger of unleashing too much property on to an already depressed market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respond first to the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I used the term "any residuary bodies". It has not been decided whether residuary bodies will be needed. The question is subject to consultation. What the hon. Member for Angus, East described as a central property management facility is very close to a residuary body. We shall consult the authorities concerned. Different considerations may apply to the north-east and to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
Strathclyde, for example. I think that the hon. Member for Linlithgow has received a helpful letter from Gordon district council. No doubt, as hon. Members have said, we shall return to those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
