	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order, Mr. Martin. You had a spot of bother earlier in the week with an interloper—I think that a dosser stayed over in the Committee Room. As a result, 	<i>Hansard</i> for Tuesday's sitting fills just one page but costs £7.50. I am not sure whether that is terribly good value. To avoid such a problem in future it might be useful to keep things moving. Therefore, given your new powers, Mr. Martin, perhaps you could show a yellow card when hon Members drift out of order and a red card when you want to send them off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that, as Chairman, I have to show any card.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. It might be of benefit to the Committee if you explained your new powers. Do they extend to being able to throw out not just interlopers, but bona fide members of the Committee who are not behaving themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that problem will ever arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I assure you that that problem will not arise with me. On arriving for our sitting this morning, I received a letter from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which has made a new calculation of the financial effects of the Bill of between £375 million and £720 million. Page ix of the Bill, under the heading, "Financial Effects of the Bill", gives a gross underestimate of those effects. Is it in order for us to continue discussing the Bill when, given the new information, the financial effects are clearly greatly underestimated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter not for me, but for the Minister. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can raise the issue with the Minister during our discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) I received information about the work of the local authorities and yesterday I wrote a long, personal letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer requesting that the Treasury should at least give an opinion on that serious work undertaken by COSLA. Can we ask through you, Mr. Martin, whether the Treasury can give us its evaluation of that work? As my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, the matter is serious and I do not think that anything to do with the Bill is a laughing matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister heard the hon. Gentleman's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and, with effect from Thursday 3rd February, at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
On behaf of the Committee, let me welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martin, and say how much we look forward to working under your experienced chairmanship. The last Scottish Bill that we discussed when I was on the Government Front Bench and you were in the Chair, Mr. Martin, was the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Bill, which was forecast widely to be non-controversial and was expected to go through Committee quickly. That forecast was not entirely accurate, but I hope that we can make a good start to our proceedings on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason for moving the sittings motion is that we have a duty to report to the House on a reasonable time-scale. We were told by the press, on behalf of the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), that there would be a rebellion by English Conservative Members and that the Government's "slender majority" of 17 would be put under threat on Second Reading. That co-ordinated "offensive"—the press's term—was not very successful. The Government had a majority of 41, which was aided by the fact that the hon. Member for Baghdad, Hillhead was in his constituency on that night. The money resolution was passed with a majority of 177 and the Ways and Means resolution with a majority of 182 as Labour Members folded their tents and went away sadly into the night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister had been to the children's hospital in Baghdad and to the hospital at Umm Qasr near the border with Kuwait, he would have seen babies expiring in his presence as a result of sanctions. He would not therefore, make such cheap remarks about my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway). My hon. Friend may have been unwise in what he said, but the situation in Iraq is terrible. It is not a subject for cheap remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or course, the situation in Baghdad is serious, but it is widely accepted that the hon. Member for Hillhead should have been in the House to vote on this important Bill. No doubt, matters of interest to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will be raised as we consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's policy is that local government reform in Scotland should not proceed until after a Scottish Assembly or Parliament has been established. When we reach those issues, my hon. Friends will wish to make a contribution. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) may wish to ask the hon. Member for Hamilton why he wants a constitutional arrangement in which he would be the Secretary of State for Scotland and responsible in Cabinet for housing in Hexham, but not in Hamilton. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) may ask the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Gentleman why he wants the constitutional position to be such that he would be responsible in Cabinet for schooling in Stroud, but not in St. Andrews. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) may wish to ask the hon. Gentleman why he wants to be responsible for planning in Blackpool, but not in the Black Isle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow has already intervened and he is following my remarks with his customary attention. If my hon. Friends need any further ammunition to make constructive contributions to the debates, the hon. Gentleman's book "Devolution: the end of Britain?" is to be commended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible to move immediately to afternoon sittings. That will allow for the maximum amount of debate without unduly delaying the passage of the Bill. As everyone on the Committee knows, the so-called usual channels are not operating in this Committee or anywhere else in the House because of a decision taken by the Opposition. I regret that. Many people outside the Committee are interested in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a judgment that we cannot all be sure is correct. My understanding is that—in fact, I know it because I was there—the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) paired with the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire), who is an English Tory. I cannot be sure that the hon. Member for Angus, East will not do something similar in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wish to give the hon. Member some leeway, but let us not stray from the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. My name has been mentioned. We have just heard the usual nonsense that we expect from Labour Members, which I suppose is an example of Labour co-operation. However, what the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) said is not true. I simply say that for the record. It is simply not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was not a point of order. The hon. Member for Angus, East was putting the record straight. Perhaps we could leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is a new point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus, East is not putting the record straight, because I was there when the arrangement was made with the hon. Member for Spelthorne and so were other hon. Members. The record in 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that neither of the hon. Members voted after 10.13 last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Those are not matters for the Committee. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can settle these matters elsewhere. It is not a matter for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it is a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong this, Mr. Martin but what has been said is simply not true. Pairing is an arrangement between the Government and the official Opposition. It used to be anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can finish with these matters and get on with the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall accept your guidance not to pursue that matter. If the two hon. Members wish to pursue it outside that is up to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, it is sensible to proceed immediately to afternoon sittings. I regret that the usual channels do not operate because it may prevent the usual sensible arrangements which enable important debates to be taken in the morning when people from Scotland and all those who are interested in them can easily attend. That does not, however, affect the sittings motion. There are parts of this Bill for which authorities would appreciate Royal Assent, earlier rather than later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For example, I should have thought that hon. Members would wish to see the early rather than late appointment of a staff commission to advise the Government on matters related to staff. Authorities will want that to be agreed relatively soon. Local authority staff will want boundary questions resolved as soon as possible. If the Opposition are really committed, as they say, to full discussion of the Bill they should welcome the sittings motion. It is not an unusual motion for a Bill of this importance and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The list of hon. Members that was distributed to us this morning has under my name the constituency of Hamilton and has under the name of the hon. Member for Hamilton my constituency of Aberdeen, South. I know that the hon. Gentleman is keen to sit on the Government Benches but that is surely going a bit far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has obviously been a printing error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse that point of order. I am sure that the name of the person representing Aberdeen, South will change pretty quickly whatever the printers do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to debate the sittings motion. As the Minister has said, it gives us a chance to air some of the important issues relating to our conduct during our proceedings. My one regret is that the Secretary of State for Scotland is not a member of the Committee. As I predicted last Wednesday at Scottish Question Time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in the Chamber, his enthusiasm for his Bill has been waning rapidly and considerably. It was always clear that at the slightest excuse, the Secretary of State would abandon ship and leave his baby in the uncertain hands of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Secretary of State is in Cabinet, defending Scotland's interests. He asked me this morning to pass on his kindest regards to the hon. Gentleman, because he does not expect to be seeing much of him in the next few weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the people of Scotland would deem the Secretary of State to be making a better job of defending Scotland if he went sailing on the Thames than he makes of it in Cabinet. We and a wider audience outside noted that the Secretary of State did not fight very hard to remain on the Committee. When it came to a trade-off between the accurate reflection of the composition of the House in the Standing Committee to consider the Bill, and the retention of that Committee of the Secretary of State, a pretty rapid move was made and the right hon. Gentleman retreated from his own Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just read an article in 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> from which it seems that the hon. Gentleman has been claiming that he forced the Secretary of State off the Committee. That claim does not seem to be quite in keeping with his remarks now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Stroud has started to read the Scottish newspapers. That must be a novelty for him and I suggest that he read some of the back numbers as well. That will give him a flavour of Scottish opinion on the matter, which I hope that he will take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State was certainly forced off the Committee, by his own hand. The commitment to gerrymandering the Committee's composition was the reason for his leaving the Committee of the flagship Bill that he promised he would guide to Report. We shall listen carefully to the Under-Secretary of State, however because he is one of the originators of the Bill. He is the godfather of the gerrymandered volume that we have before us—the marks of Scotland on the book of Stewart. It is a gerrymandered plan for Scotland, which begins with one essential building block—the optimistic maintenance of a power base on Eastwood district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Stewartry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a tiny fiefdom, from which, it seems, the butchery of Scottish local government is to be accomplished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome you, Madam—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I welcome you, Mr. Martin, to the Chair. You can understand how sensitive I am at present, particularly given my experience with Madam Speaker the other day.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
We welcome your down-to-earth skills and wisdom in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee now includes a large number of new English Conservatives whose sudden interest in Scottish affairs, as the hon. Member for Stroud just showed, will be coming to the fore during the hours and hours that will be devoted to the Bill. Very few of those hon. Members attended the Second Reading or the debate on the Queen's Speech, at which the matter was also discussed. In case their background reading has not included the speeches made in those debates, I remind them that they will be considering a uniquely Scottish measure in a uniquely Scottish context, on which they should reflect very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stable from which the Bill has come has produced other ideas in the past. I give warning to Conservative Members that the same alchemists who produced the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill, to which they are to devote their lives for the next few weeks, are those who begot the poll tax. Those same ideological maniacs produced a scheme for local government finance—the word "maniac" is most inappropriate given what happened to the poll tax and to the party that advanced it. The poll tax was invented in Scotland to get Minsters off a certain hook. It was sold on arguments of fairness and cost-effectiveness. It was to be the revelation in local government finance. The consequence was misery for those who had the poll tax inflicted on them. Misery was also inflicted, luckily, on the Conservative party and its then leader, who disappeared into not-too-great obscruity down the Corridor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members, who are members of the Committee because of the constitutional nature of the United Kingdom, should bear in mind the arguments put forward by Ministers, research carefully what happened in the past and what those people sold north of the border, and worry about it. They genuinely have something to worry about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme of local government that the Committee will consider is designed principally for the interest of the Scottish Conservative party. If the objective is attained, it will be at enormous cost and at the dislocation of fundamental services for the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation is not simply one Bill: it is the largest Bill that the Government have brought before Parliament since 1979, and it should be split into four Bills. Had it related to England, that would have happened. One large Bill will reorganise local government in Scotland in such a way that is negative, expensive, unnecessary and has no public support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also relates to Scotland's water and will make a rearrangement that 95 per cent. of the Scottish population and 85 per cent. of Conservative supporters think is wrong. Control of water supplies will be taken out of the hands of directly elected representatives of the people and handed over, along with the consultative machinery, to the diktat of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is rightiy warning hon. Members who represent English constituencies about the consequences of the Bill. How many of them does he think will vote to mitigate those consequences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman continues endlessly to make that point in Committee I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
doubt that many people will listen. I cannot predict what Conservative Members will do, because I cannot predict what will happen in the seat occupied by the hon. Gentleman. It was occupied by two members of the Scottish National party on Tuesday, but thankfully by only one today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall see how powerful the arguments are, but my arguments will not be designed to alienate English people; they will demonstrate to Conservative Members from south of the border that they should be wary about what they are being sold by Scottish Office Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains massively important provisions for the water industry in Scotland that have no basis of support. Hon. Members who were not present for the debate on Second Reading should read the submission to hon. Members from the Scottish Landowners Federation. The federation is hardly the most radical fount of opinion in Scotland, but its criticism of the arrangements for water should be borne in mind by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will reorganise the children's hearing system and will centralise an effective system of which Scotland can be justifiably proud. The system will not be improved, but altered by the Government's centralising obsession, which affects every area of public life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will also reorganise the tourism promotion industry. That should have been the subject of a fourth Bill as the issue is serious and conflicting opinions have been expressed about it. Four Bills have, unfortunately, been rolled into one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local government provisions are serious and I shall discuss a few points to demonstrate that time is needed to consider them. We have a valuable opportunity this morning to identify for Members of the Committee what we are anxious about.

The discussion of boundaries will take some time and cause anxiety. I welcome the fact that the Government have produced a book of the gerrymandering, so that the maps are available and we can make considered decisions.

I was surprised to read in a letter from a Scottish district council that a Conservative Member will be tabling an amendment to give that particular district unitary status. I believe that it is the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) who has given that commitment, and I hope that he has consulted his hon. Friends on the Front Bench about it. I am not surprised that the Minister appears not to know. Perhaps no one consults him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let me make it absolutely clear that of course my hon. Friends are entirely free to table amendments to the Bill if they wish to do so. The Government are not seeking in any way to dissuade Conservative Members from tabling amendments. If they wish to do so, it is a matter for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will take notice of that, as will people outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when Conservative Members table and move amendments, they will pursue them to a vote and stand by them. They should not use amendments as a hobby-horse or a frivolity to try and gain a little public attention. Any amendments of theirs that will change or improve the Bill will assuredly be welcome. I am certain that Conservative Members, whether from north or south of the border, will show an independence of thought that will appeal to the Scottish people. That may help Conservative members when it comes to the difficult circumstances of the regional and European elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the Minister's significant intervention, in which he seemed to invite his hon. Friends to table amendments, does my hon. Friend agree that it would be deplorable if the Committee became bogged down for weeks on end considering detailed amendments about boundaries, as that would lead the Government to introduce a guillotine, which would reduce the time allowed to debate provisions on water and other important parts of the Bill? I sincerely hope that the Government will not use that device.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my exact point. I sincerely hope that that will not happen. Opposition Members intend to table amendments where they are relevant and proper, and where we intend to support them. We will not filibuster, or obstruct the Bill's progress. The Bill contains 169 clauses and 14 schedules which demand proper scrutiny. In addition, they must be exposed for what they are, what they represent, and the damage that they will do to the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will table amendments with a view to moving them in Committee, and we will do so with some expedition. If Conservative Members table amendments simply to gain public attention but have no intention of supporting them in Committee, such behaviour will be deprecated. If the Minister chooses to use that later as justification for a guillotine, those Conservative Members will not be forgiven easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon.

I did not invite Conservative Members to table amendments. I said that they are entirely free to do so if they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is semantics for you, Mr. Martin. Of course they are entirely free to do so. They are now telling the press and lobbying organisations that they will. I rest my case on the view that we hope that if they do, they will pursue the amendments to the vote and not simply to gain attention from outside. One can view the Minister's enthusiasm for Back-Bench Conservative amendments in the light of the very narrow majority that he will have to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will move amendments on the boundaries issue where we consider that there is a proper case for doing so. We do not believe that this reorganisation should take place—we do not believe that it should take place without a Scottish Parliament in Scotland deciding what the relationship should be between the Scottish Parliament and local institutions. At the very least, there should have been a proper independent review of local government in Scotland. As the measure is now in Committee and must be considered, we have an obligation to protect the people of Scotland from its worst excesses. Our amendments will aim to improve a piece of bad legislation. We will act in a business-like way to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will scrutinise the Bill and expose its deficiencies as our consideration proceeds. As people in Scotland begin to realise the cost that this self-indulgence by the Scottish Conservative party will impose on them, I have no doubt that at the elections in the first week of May, their verdict on the Government, made through the ballot box, will be profound and damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to touch on some issues that will be considered by the Committee. The questions of transitional relief and support for voluntary organisations have already resulted in a huge mail-bag to right hon. and hon. Members in Committee and in the House. Many voluntary organisations, which work hard on detailed matters and contribute conscientiously to the wealth of the community, genuinely fear the danger that faces them from a Bill that makes no promises about their future funding. I know that Conservative Members will want to join us in getting assurances and commitments on that matter from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues of school catchment areas and the role of schools in Scotland have already excited considerable controversy. The Catholic education sector was among the first to come forward with its concerns—its "fears", to quote Archbishop Winning—about what the Bill will do. The archbishop makes the point, as have other Catholic Church leaders in Scotland—about how unconvincing ministerial assurances have been on this issue. The Government's arguments, especially in relation to school catchment areas, are not confined to those in the Catholic education sector. They apply throughout Scotland. Arbitrary lines have been drawn that will cut
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
communities into tiny fractions and affect the way in which their schools operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from Archbishop Winning, which will be sent this week to all Catholic congregations in Scotland makes this point specifically, and it is worth mentioning it early in our proceedings. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"New council boundaries will arbitrarily sever long-standing and effective links between some secondary schools and their associated primaries even within natural communities. This will apply particularly to Catholic secondary schools which have generally larger catchment areas than non-denominational schools. Thus, some families may be prevented from attending the local secondary school with which they have been traditionally associated."</p></blockquote>
Archbishop Winning concludes in this valuable document, which I know will be circulated to all members of the Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such is the extent of dissatisfaction with the Government's proposals that all of the Churches in Scotland, all of the parents organisations, and all of the teachers organisations and unions view the Governments proposals as unacceptable."</p></blockquote>
That is the verdict on one key area of a 169-clause Bill. We shall debate those clauses, but, until now, Government assurances have failed to allay the fears that exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area that is exciting attention and will lead to debates in Committee is the withdrawal of the statutory obligation to have education committees, social work committees and directors of education and of social work in Scotland. The Minister will say that new arrangements will be made. The chief librarian could, presumably, also be the director of education because there would be nothing to prevent that happening. That signals to local government and the wider community the Government's unwillingness to place an obligation in an area where everyone agrees crucial decisions must be made at a local level. We shall return to that later and consider it with great seriousness. I hope that Conservative Members will come to the assistance of the Scottish people on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to the substantial clauses on water, the arrangement is profoundly unsatisfactory. Yes, of course, the Government backed off from their ambitions for full-scale water privatisation. They did so in the face of huge—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Are we discussing part I or part II of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should be following our proceedings. He should know what we are discussing. It is not for me to educate him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. We seem to be discussing water, sewerage and such allied matters. I wonder whether that comes within part I or part II.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I say again to the hon. Member that he should know. I hope that he is not questioning my judgment in allowing the hon. Member for Hamilton to continue his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Stroud was one of the few people to master the contents of the Maastricht treaty. He has obviously not had enough time to get up to speed on this Bill—reading an article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> was as much as he could manage at first bite. As he wades his way through the 221 pages of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Bill, it will give him just as much, satisfaction and just as big a thrill as reading the whole of the Maastricht treaty gave him last year. As a consequence, I hope that he will vote as much with the Opposition as he did last year, when I was so happy to welcome him into our Lobby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sections of the Bill on water are of enormous importance. Despite the Government's retreat from full-scale privatisation—no wonder because the opinion polls say that 95 per cent. of the Scottish people want the industry kept under local authority control—they are trying to design a system that will take power from locally and directly elected representatives and hand it to the Government's list of cronies and normal quango holders. We shall want to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also want to examine the remarkable model of consultative committees. Those committees will be established in the name of customers, but they will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland who tells us that he will be responsible for every dripping tap in Scotland. To coin a phrase that "does not wash". We shall therefore consider in detail the arrangements for water. That will take some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rearrangement of the provisions for the reporters on the children's hearings will also take up some time—and rightly so. Genuine fears have been expressed that the atomisation of the local council structure may lead to the weakening of a system that has served the country so well since it was instituted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A variety of views on tourism have been expressed. As this is the Bill's final stage I hope that adequate time will be available to the Committee to debate it
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stroud has twice already managed to intervene, adding up brownie points that may perhaps repair the damage to his reputation caused by what he did last year. He has, presumably, much to live down in the eyes of the Tory Whips, but I have checked his voting record and he was one of those who trusted Scottish Office Ministers over the poll tax. That was inadvisable and incautious but I hope that during his background reading the hon. Gentleman will see precisely what he voted for, and its consequences, and that his bedtime reading of the Bill may bring him to a new conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Whip, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope), who joins us on the Committee, is a former councillor. I hope that his experience of local government and his reputation for independence will lead him to recognise the genuine folly of the proposals. The hon. Member for Hexham also served as an elected councillor, though I should mention that it was on Wandsworth council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was Wandsworth. However, he also serves on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. He must have committed a pretty heinous crime way back to have been forced to serve on both Scottish Committees. Although the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, hoping to win
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
support from his hon. Friend the Member for Hexham, says that he served "with distinction'', I must mention that he was one of the six Conservative Members who turned up last November to vote on the issue of the Greater Glasgow health board and, despite hearing that day's disturbing revelations, voted not to produce a report. That is not a very good start, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman will redeem his reputation in the eyes of the Scottish people by considering the arguments and voting sensibly on some of the Labour party's proposals.

The hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs) is presumably here in his capacity as Parliamentary Private Secretary, to pass notes to the Cabinet about the performance of the Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I do not know whether marks out of ten or gold or silver stars will be passed down the line. A wide variety of interests is listed for the hon. Member for Swindon in "Dods Parliamentary Companion". They are, apparently,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Marketing, Transport, Tourism, Health Promotion, Nuclear Energy, Information Technology, Cable TV"</p></blockquote>
and the list goes on beyond that. But there is not a word about Scottish affairs or anything at all connected with Scotland to qualify him for membership of this Committee. I presume that he is here to propose the great toast to absent hon. Friends and that he will keep the Secretary of State well briefed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon.

Surely in attacking members of the Committee he is attacking the Committee of Selection for its choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Martin, I would hate to transgress your instructions. Serving as a Front-Bench spokesman on foreign affairs is not a natual qualification for serving on Scottish Standing Committees.

The Opposition will not attempt to delay the Bill unnecessarily. We want it to make good progress and would have been content for the Bill to be in Committee last Tuesday, but the Secretary of State for Scotland bungled his attempt to gerrymander the Committee's composition and obtain a majority of two.

By no stretch of the imagination could it be a point of order, but if the hon. Member for Blackpool, North wants me to mention his constituency and his service on the Committee I am glad to do so.

A cursory check of the index in the House of Commons Library shows that since the hon. Gentleman became a Member of the House, he has asked only one question vaguely related to Scottish business.

Although the Opposition are keen for the Bill to make progress, we are determined to see that it recieves the scrutiny that it deserves. I warn the Ministers that any attempt to introduce a guillotine will be fiercely resisted and gravely resented in Scotland. Last Thursday, 	<i>The Scotsman</i> quoted the Secretary of State—who is absent—as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have no firm timetable in mind for completion of the committee stage. All that matters is that we get through the bill in detail and through the parliamentary processes before the end of the parliamentary session."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister with responsibility for local government quash speculation that abounds throughout the Palace that the Government are anxious for the Bill to be out of Committee by Easter? Does the Minister realise that such a timetable would be woefully inadequate to deal with such an important matter when such a large number of issues need to be discussed? He is aware that the Committee stage of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 lasted four months from 21 January to 15 May 1973. That Act followed a detailed, extremely important and wise Royal commission. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That Act was preceded by seven years of consultation for which there had been a freely established consensus in Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Wheately commission on local government in Scotland commenced its deliberations in 1966. It was only after nine years of extensive and wide-ranging consultation that the new local authorities were put in place. By contrast, we are now supposed to believe that a new, robust, sustainable local government system can be put in place only five years after the first announcement of a reorganisation of local government, and that it can and will be up and running without a hitch. It is not enough for Ministers to claim that the Bill is slightly smaller than the 1973 Act and involves less complex reorganisation. That will not wash. Even taking into account the size of the Bill, the Committee stage must last until at least 21 April to go by the pattern established by the last Bill. When one takes into account the gross inadequacy of the consultations that have preceded it, the Government's timetable looks even more unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable is quite impossibly tight. One cannot in all seriousness expect to achieve a durable system of local government of whatever kind in such a short time span. It will not last. Unless local authorities are given more time to manage the change, and unless Parliament is given more time to debate all these matters, there will be chaos

Member for Hamilton made a confused and contrasting speech. In his concluding words he condemned the Government for, as he saw it, delaying the Committee by arguing that the Secretary of State should be included in the Committee to achieve the necessary majority to allow the business to be taken through. However, in his opening remarks he suggested that the Secretary of State had gerrymandered his way off the Bill. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. In future he should consider his words more carefully. We can all look at the 	<i>Hansard</i> report. It will show that he said one thing at the beginning and totally reversed his comments by the time he reached his conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. I was disappointed that it was delayed on Tuesday. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) has recognised that that move was almost certainly counterproductive. The fact that he stayed out of the Committee Room today does him some credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday a number of people came to sit in the Public Gallery to listen to the opening remarks on Bill because it is important to them. They incurred a great deal of expense and wasted much time. I am delighted that those who have taken the trouble to attend today are able to listen to what I hope will be a constructive start to our debates.

The Bill's general contents are of vital interest to everyone in Scotland. It can be made to work for them. The intent to bring local government to a level at which local involvement and local accountability can take place is fundamental.

The hon. Member for Hamilton referred to the Wheately commission. He said that it got under way in 1966 and eventually concluded on a structure that gave us a two-tier system that included Strathclyde. The result of the Wheately commission's 10 years of deliberations was that we ended up with Strathclyde regional council with which no one in Ayrshire identified.

The letters in my mail bag and the contacts that I have had about the Bill, show that I have received representations from all over Scotland and opinions from district and community councils and voters. Reading their views, I realise that the Government can achieve much popularity because of the Bill. That is contrary to the view of Labour Members. I suggest that Labour Members take account of messages received from their constituents and local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way, given the hon. Gentleman's seniority and the respect in which he is held in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of consultation with the people of Ayr, I have a serious letter from Right Rev. Maurice Taylor of 8 Corsehill road, Ayr in the diocese of Galloway. The letter deals with Catholic education in Ayr and the diocese of Galloway. Has the hon. Gentleman had any time to reflect on the fears of that Catholic bishop about the Bill's effects on the future of Catholic education? That is a matter of considerable concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman. I have received a letter from Right Rev. Maurice Taylor just as I have received one from Archbishop Winning I take every representation that I receive seriously. On that basis, I shall meet Archbishop Winning at 2 o'clock this afternoon to discuss his concerns about the effect of the Bill. I trust that that is the sort of contact and listening that every member—especially Labour Members—of the Committee will hold during the course of our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton suggested that it was wrong for us to table amendments on other areas. I have spoken to some Labour Members who have been bullied into not tabling such amendments. I shall gladly refrain from tabling amendments on other areas if Labour Members do their duty to the local authorities that they represent and table the amendments that local authorities and their constituents want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. The hon. Gentleman will have his chance later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, because I referred to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been no bullying of Labour Members. We shall act in an organised fashion to ensure that the Bill's deficiencies are fully exposed. If the hon. Gentleman tables, for example, an amendment calling for a unitary authority according to the boundaries of the present Dunfermline district council, will he vote for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I table such an amendment, I will do so to give every member of the Committee the opportunity to debate a matter that is near and dear to the people of the area. After the debate, I shall make up my mind, just as I expect every member of the Committee to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could speak for a considerable time, but I respect the wishes of other hon. Members who want to speak. Thank you, Mr. Martin, for giving me an early opportunity to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Committee is moving away from the mood of high drama and apprehension of recent weeks. The Committee must buckle down to a serious job of work because the Bill is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
serious piece of legislation. I look forward to playing a full part in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proceedings will be difficult as the Bill has 169 clauses and, whatever happens, the Committee has a tight schedule. I hope to make a constructive contribution and, in the main, I endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Hamilton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that progress is made and I support the sittings motion. I hope that it can be disposed of this morning because, as I understand procedure, if it is not, afternoon sittings may be prejudiced. I would regret that as time has to be made up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of the Committee of Selection so am partly responsible for this fine body of people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The guilty man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or I am the guilty man, as the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee of Selection's work was valuable, but meant that there was a slight hiatus in starting proceedings. That was right and I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee of Selection for acknowledging the need to accommodate the differing views that were expressed about the constitution of this Committee and the Government majority on it. A majority of one will put the Government under closer scrutiny than would have been the case had there been a majority of two. That will have implications for the sittings of the Committee. The longer that we can sit and the more robust and constructive the pressure that the Government are put under with a majority of one, the better the chance of changing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the Minister the best of luck. He is going to need it, flanked by his Knight and Lord. They will have many a happy hour together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the question of the Committee of Selection, will he clear up a point? I spoke to the Chairman of that Committee, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale (Sir F. Montgomery), who said that he was swimming on the matter. I have sympathy for the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale. What is the position in relation to the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn)? He suggested that, as a Member of Parliament, representing Scotland, he would willingly serve on the Committee. Whatever anyone thinks of the hon. and learned Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee is supposed to be discussing the sittings motion. The intervention bears no relation to it, as it deals with the Committee's composition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the matter is delicate, but the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is a conscientious member of the Committee of Selection. On the Floor of the House, some hon. Members asked about that matter. As the hon. Member for Angus, East knows, I do not always agree with his party, but at least—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. To help the Committee with the point of order, I must say that the Committee is not at
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
liberty to debate the business of the Committee of Selection or matters discussed on the Floor of the House. I hope that discussion will return to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin. The Committee of Selection does not, thank goodness, have to justify the selection of every member of every Committee. If that was the case, it would be difficult to find hon. Members to serve on that Committee. The rules and Standing Orders of the House make clear the matters that the Committee of Selection must take into account in arriving at its decision. If the hon. Member for Linlithgow wishes to pursue that question, I suggest that he does so with the Chairman of the Committee of Selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was simply making the point, which I believe to be in order, that the constitution of the Committee, which was decided by the Committee of Selection, has an implication for its timetable. It certainly has an implication for the timetable as far as the Government are concerned. It would not have been necessary to have afternoon sittings this quickly had the Government taken a bit more care over the measure. There is a stark contrast between the atmosphere in which the Committee is doing its work and that which obtained in 1973. The Minster may say that the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 took a tremendously long time in gestation. It was preceded by a royal commission, however, and a series of discussions which achieved a remarkable degree of consensus. I appreciate that the Standing Committee considering that legislation achieved some change. I cling to the hope that the changes to some of the areas—and the 1973 Act introduced major changes—will still apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion is so strict partly because the Government have not put the Bill together properly. For example, an independent commission would have made the provisions of schedule 1 easier for the Committee to countenance. It would have been better if the proposals had been subject to an objective assessment by an independent body of experts, which took the trouble and time to consider the available options. Had such information been produced, the sittings motion could have been much more relaxed and the Committee could have carried out its deliberations in a better informed way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman see the excellent "On the Record" programme a week last Sunday? Sir John Banham, who chairs the English local government commission said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not going to end up in smoke-filled rooms with squabbling politicians, trying to force us to cut a deal which might meet their short-term political imperitives but ignores the longer term strategic future of local government in particular areas."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that valuable point. No doubt we will return to it later in our proceedings. I am simply making the point that the sittings motion could have been a lot more relaxed if an assessment had been made in advance of the Committee's constitution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a plea to every member of the Committee—and I shall accept it as a discipline on myself—that we take particular care of the timetabling of the sittings, especially with regard to sitting late. I do not say that simply for the convenience of members of the Committee and the Chair. We have a duty, however, to people outside the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Committee—those involved in council groups, council staff and the electorate. Although I am not adverse to sitting late, it is a not a good idea to consider issues after midnight, because I do not think that anyone, after a day's work in this place, is in a sensible state. Some of us are in a more sensible state than others at 12 o'clock at night. I am looking at the Government Whip when I say that, as a general rule, we should not sit after midnight unless it is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider setting out a clearly understood timetable, as far as that can be achieved, especially for schedule 1. People who want to come from the Borders—and I know that there are many—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian is a distinguished constituent of mine. He watches me carefully, and I have to account to him daily. One day he might even vote for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a duty, particularly with regard to schedule 1, to get an idea of when the various matters will be considered. People in my region will want to come and listen and to make representations to the Committee, if hon. Members will allow that to happen. I hope that we can manage to organise that within the informal timetable to which we are working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with what the hon. Member says. I referred to precisely that point in my opening remarks in support of the sittings motion. His comments are entirely fair and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I ask the hon. Member for Linlithgow to go outside to have his conversation with a member of the public. That would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree in principle with the hon. Gentleman. He will recognise that not just in Committee but throughout the House, the Opposition are refusing to have any discussions or any of the informal communication that normally go on between the parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister anticipates my next point. I was just about to say that of the usual channels, I am the only one that remains open. For a small fee, or should I say a substantial fee, I will continue to remain open. I was described the other day as a ringmaster which to me is someone who runs round in circles and sometimes meets himself coming round the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both Front Benches may believe that it is always the other side's fault. The atmosphere in other parts of the Palace, in the absence of the usual channels, will make things very difficult if we are not careful. We must therefore all accept a degree of discipline to make progress on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that a timetable motion will not be necessary. The Government will look to us to make sure that it is not necessary and we must accept that. I am prepared to do that as best as I am able. The hon. Member for Hamilton made the point that if we had the same amount of time as was allocated to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 we would sit until April. Easter is not a watershed. I would rather have good quality scrutiny of
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
every clause, in a free atmosphere, than have the Bill frogmarched through Committee under a timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains enabling provisions which are quite unjustifiable. If our debates are constructive enough, however, we will influence the Government's introduction of the enabling powers. If we cannot influence the primary legislation and get the enabling powers changed, at least the Government may take points that are made in Committee into consideration in the production of the secondary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say this in any personal way against any of the English Members who are entitled to be here, but it is absurd that they have to be dragooned on to the Committee. That is a matter for a debate elsewhere and at another time. We need substantial constitutional change to get a better process for organising the legislative process north of the Border. The sooner that comes the better. As members of the Committee we have a responsibility for all those affected by the Bill. There is a substantial number of them and I look forward to contributing to that process as best I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of detaining the Committee longer than is necessary. I very much welcome the opportunity to sit on the Committee. I have not been dragooned into taking part in the debate on a Bill which is important not only for my constituents but for the whole of Scotland. It is a long Bill; 169 clauses. It will take a lot of debating. There are many issues on which our constituents seek clarification. I welcome the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret our false start on Tuesday. The disservice that the SNP has done to Scotland is extreme. The nationalists have clearly shown that they wish to disrupt proceedings in this place rather than to conduct healthy debate on important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been lengthy debate among my constituents since the publication of the consultation documents about local government reform. Much of the debate has been about boundaries, but in my area a significant amount has also related to the composition of the Bill and the likely functions of the new single-tier authorities. Local authority employees in my area are now keen to discuss the way forward. The Grampian association of district councils, for example, is keen to set up a shadow committee to discuss some of the problems that will have to be dealt with after the Bill is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can make orderly progress on the Bill. I welcome, and hope that I may believe, the assurance given by the hon. Member for Hamilton that we shall make orderly progress. Debate on some of the amendments on specific boundaries could be lengthy. I have an interest in two such groups of amendments, but I hope that the Committee will act responsibly and debate seriously, without repeating the performance that was made when the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Bill was in Committee. I remember that you chaired that Committee, Mr. Martin. The next day I read speeches given at 3am by Opposition Members which made no more sense when I read them than when I heard them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can consider the Bill with a degree of bonhomie between the two sides of the Committee. I hope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
that we can ensure the proper discussion of all matters of concern, and that we shall get on with the business, as these matters are very important for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that there will be no bonhomie from me. More than 31 years ago I first served on a Scottish Committee in this very Room. A man named Jimmy McInnes was the extremely assiduous Opposition Member for Glasgow, Central. The place of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton was occupied by his predecessor but four, the late Tom Fraser, an able and charming man. The Minister's place was also occupied by an able and charming man, whose obituary I prepared for 	<i>The Independent,</i> Jack Maclay, Viscount Muirshiel. I mention the obituary because it caused me to consider in detail some of his qualities, which included listening and flexibility. I hope that throughout the debate the Minister will show the same qualities as his distinguished predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe in taking a personal approach to these matters, but I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, will show the same flexibility and intelligence in this matter as was displayed by his mother-in-law, who sat in that very place all those years ago. Those are the last personal remarks that the Committee will hear from me during consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a great pity that nothing came of the idea put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, which I raised with the Leader of the House, for four or five sittings devoted to evidence—not from every district or regional council, but at least from the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, from the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, and several others that could have given objective evidence. It is a pity because during such sittings an answer to a basic question would have been welcomed. Who wants the legislation? Where is the demand coming from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the hon. Member for Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that it comes from the hon. Member for Ayr, but I want to know which organisations and groups are clamouring for the Bill and why it should be more important than a children Act for Scotland. From our constituency work, all hon. Members know that a Scottish children Act is a matter of crying urgency. Why should this Bill be given priority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is important and I shall not blether, but I have some questions for the Minister. In an interview in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"People are fed up with the inefficiency, duplication, bureaucracy, lack of accountability and costs of the present system."</p></blockquote>
I am entitled to ask which people and which organisations are fed up. Inevitably, there are petty grievances against all local government no matter how hard it tries. But the Secretary of State's sweeping statement owes less to objective considerations than to saloon bar gossip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the demand for the Bill coming from? It has not come from the organisations that have contacted us. Still less is it from distinguished civil servants, many of whom are mystified by why they are being asked to work upon it. If I refer to the old days, a rigorous man such as Sir Douglas Haddow would be turning in his grave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Before I deal with the sittings motions, I wish to refer to another urgent matter. It is general knowledge among hon. Members that a pastoral letter will be put out in Catholic churches. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has already referred to that. As Members of Parliament, we have received many inquiries, and the terms of the letter are formidable. Incidentally, it expresses the views of not only Archbishop Winning and the Right Rev. Maurice Taylor, who is the Bishop of Galloway, but many other Catholic organisations. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In recent months, however, substantial worries have been voiced about the implications for Catholic pupils, parents and teachers of the proposals for local government reform which are now being considered by Parliament. These fears have been formally raised at meetings between Church representatives and the Scottish Office."</p></blockquote>
Archbishop Winning adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have to report to you that we have been unsuccessful in obtaining any guarantee that the rights and opportunities currently enjoyed by the Catholic community will remain in place under the proposed new local authorities. These new authorities will be responsible for delivering the education service."</p></blockquote>
The pastoral letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"New council boundaries will arbitarily sever long-standing and effective links between some secondary schools and their associated primaries even within natural communities. This will apply particularly to Catholic secondary schools which have generally larger catchment areas than non-denominational schools. Thus, some families may be prevented from attending the local secondary school with which they have been traditionally associated."</p></blockquote>
This Sunday, the letter will be read in every church or delivered to every Catholic churchgoer. It is urgent that provision be made in the sittings motion for a Scottish Office explanation of its position about what took place during the discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the proposals, Catholic education may be available to some children only if the new councils are prepared to pay transport costs and cross-boundary payments. Significantly, the proposals do not require the new councils to accept this responsibility."</p></blockquote>
What are the new councils to be told? The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some schools may be affected by overcrowding caused by an influx of pupils who previously would have attended a school in another authority's area. Others might eventually see a dramatic drop in rolls because of new catchment arrangements, thereby placing their future viability at risk."</p></blockquote>
I cannot talk in detail about Strathclyde, but I know that the chairman of the Lothian education committee, Mrs. Maginnis, her colleagues and the officials who have to deal with the matter have wrestled with the problem satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is sensitive, but the Committee should be given a suggestion of the Government's thinking before next Sunday. In the letter, the hierarchy states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Though these concerns have been voiced officially, the response from the Scottish Office, both politically and at officer level, has suggested that matters can be resolved through legislation regarding placing requests."</p></blockquote>
The archbishop regards that
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a sidestepping of the issues."</p></blockquote>
The issues must be faced straight on at an early stage. Whatever is thought about the 1918 Act, it should not be changed, back-door, through a Bill that purports to be about local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley made a legitimate and important point of order. Is there likely to be, at an early stage, a revision of the Treasury estimates? Yesterday, the Scottish Office will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
have received a truly formidable document from COSLA. It is non-political—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] That is part of the trouble. Such serious work, carried out by officials whose politics I do not know, cannot be laughed away. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South should learn something from Lady Tweedsmuir, at least she listens to arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should be given the Treasury view by Scottish Office Ministers. I sent a copy of the letter from COSLA to the Chancellor and shall send a copy to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury today. My hon. Friends and I would like a statement to be made about whether changes have been made to the financial implications. I do not want to exceed the time on any occasion, so I shall leave my remarks at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout the proud and glorious history of the English people, we—the greatest, the noblest and most feared race on earth—have been called upon to serve other nations throughout the world. It is no surprise to me that five of us should be serving on the Committee. It is a great delight to have volunteered to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout history Scottish government issues have been of great interest to English people, especially to those in the north of England. Indeed, north Lancashire was once part of the kingdom of Strathclyde. Much of southern Scotland, including Edinburgh, was once part of the English kingdom of Northumbria. Therefore, Scottish government issues are of concern to us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship between the north of England and Scotland continues today. My constituents are pleased that it should do so because many of the Scottish diaspora have made their homes in Blackpool. About 5,000 Scots live in Blackpool and millions visit every year to enjoy the facilities and excellent holidays that that great town offers. My constituents have almost a love affair with Scotland so great is the enthusiasm that they have for Scottish visitors. In the old days, the Glasgow police used to accompany many of the Scottish visitors. Our enthusiasm for them is so great that we rather wish that those days were back again.

I am here as an Englishman and I have the right to be as an English unionist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be contradicting himself. He began by beating his breast about the proud English who went out to help other nations—as I remember it, that help meant to oppress them. Why did the hon. Gentleman need the Glasgow police to protect him from Scottish holidaymakers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that we were protected from Scottish holidaymakers. I said that Scottish holidaymakers traditionally enjoyed coming to Blackpool. So great was their enthusiasm that they communicated it to the Glasgow police who accompanied them at the same time. Many people wish that such days of enthusiasm would return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am here as an Englishman and as an English unionist. It is important that we should think of the Union when we consider the issues. Many of the issues that we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
discuss have an impact on the Union as a whole. The Union is as important to my constituents as it is to Scotland. It is a vital dynamic in our economic life and for our common wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the Union is good government. That is clear in Northern Ireland where there is much concern about the democratic deficit, which has had deleterious effect on the strength of the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the words of the hon. Member for Hamilton that English Conservative Members should consider carefully the arguments of the Opposition very much to heart. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall do that. I believe in our common Union and the Bill is important for that. It is about good government. I am concerned to ensure that the Bill provides precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area in which I am interested and about which I am keen to listen to the Opposition is the promotion of tourism. My hon. Friend the Member for Swindon shares my concern because he is the chairman of the Conservative Back Bench tourism committee. No doubt, we shall hear good arguments about the promotion of tourism being a matter for the Union and that it should not be left to regional or national boards. My hon. Friend and I will look forward to deploying and discussing those arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>Opposition Members need have no fear that English Conservatives will not listen carefully to the arguments. They may find that they will sometimes appreciate our presence on the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Sir James. I am sure that you would have been interested in the outpourings of a self-confessed unionist from England. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North started off badly, but he ended up making some serious points. I am glad to hear that he intends to address Scottish issues seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a massive Bill which affects every aspect of Scottish local government, including administration and the boundaries. Over the past 15 years, government from Westminster has been held in increasing contempt by people in Scotland. They take the view that hon. Members from England have been voting on specifically Scottish measures for purely trivial reasons or on the basest political grounds. If the hon. Member for Blackpool, South is serious about wanting to protect the Union between Scotland and England, he and his hon. Friends should be aware of the feeling that is building up in Scotland because of that trivial approach to Scottish affairs by England. Scottish nationalism is deriving its support from that feeling. Earlier this week, we saw something of the silliness that can be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I should like to apologise to the Committee. I was just checking that the COSLA finance document was drawn up by non-political officials. I am assured that the document was, indeed, drawn up entirely by non-political officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's apology. Mr. John Home Robertson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that some Northern Ireland Members are a bit worried when they hear the first part of my name called. You have the whole story there, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton told a cautionary tale for the benefit of Conservative Members about the track record of local government legislation in Scotland. The last time that I served on a Committee considering local government in Scotland, the Bill became the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987—better known in due course as the poll tax Act. Oh, how we warned the Conservative Members on that Committee of the trouble that they were getting into. They would not listen. They enacted that Bill, and where are they now? Two of them are in the House of Lords—Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and Lord Mackay of Ardbrechnish. They were the lucky ones. Almost all the rest have disappeared without trace. One or two, such as the hon. Members for Winchester (Mr. Malone) and for Devises (Mr. Ancram) were displaced to England. I do not know what has happened to Alex Pollock, Anna McCurley, Barry Henderson and John Corrie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will stick to discussing the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the end of the lecture, Sir James. All those Conservative Members lost their seats at the next general election. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was one of the two or three survivors, and it would be wise for them to recognise that
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
their approach to the Bill could have serious consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be the final arbiter of this massive Bill. I am unhappy about the motion's terms. Six months of consultation followed the preparation of the consultation document and the White Paper, but the Bill is a dog's breakfast. There is a mass of detailed provisions about boundaries and the future administration of services. I do not know how members of the Committee—particularly English members—can address the details of the subject properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know much about the hon. Members for Stroud and for Blackpool, North or the rest of them, but I wonder how much they know about Scottish affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. By questioning the ability of Conservative Members to examine the Bill, surely the hon. Gentleman is questioning the Committee of Selection, which put them on the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that no hon. Member should question the Committee of Selection. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will discuss the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Sir James, that I am not questioning the Committee of Selection. My point is that the Committee has to do its job properly and it is difficult to do so as certain hon. Members may not have had the benefit of receiving the same representations as those hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pity that proceedings could not take place under the arrangements for a Special Standing Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow said. That would make it possible for all members of the Committee to be briefed about the Bill's detailed provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even at this embryo stage in our proceedings, it is clear that we have lost greatly by not having, for example, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and the treasurers in front of us to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must make it clear that that stage has been passed. The Committee is dealing with the Bill that the House has sent to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and am afraid that the Committee is labouring under great difficulties. Decent legislation will not result in the circumstances. It may be better to sit just in the mornings to create time for briefings elsewhere to enable us to study the Bill's detailed aspects properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation document has been published for six months or more and hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies have received masses of representations about boundaries, school catchment areas and the future of concessionary fare schemes. My constituents are worried about proposals that would split their historic districts, perhaps adding a part to Berwickshire and part to a detached bit of west Lothian with the rest going to mid Lothian. They do not understand where the idea came from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
No one in my constituency or in other areas affected by the curious gerrymandering proposals can understand how the Scottish Office has come forward with such ideas. No one has been given an explanation, so it is the duty of the Committee to try to tease all that out. Now that the Government are playing a game of cat and mouse—apparently a double act between the Minister and the hon. Member for Ayr—we do not know what is on offer, or what the Government are prepared to accept in the way of boundaries. It would be useful if we could have more information about that before we agree to sit, mornings and afternoons on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The background to the sittings motion is thoroughly unsatisfactory—as is the background to the entire Bill. We shall have to make the best of a very bad job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the latter remarks by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North. I hope that he and his colleagues will take note of my earlier, serious point about the fact that recent Scottish legislation brought before the House has been bringing the Union and Parliament into disrepute in Scotland. I hope that he and his hon. Friends will tackle the Bill seriously and try to create a better framework than the Government now offer. If we fail to achieve that, there will be damage to Scotland, and that will damage the Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I raise this point now because I do not wish to get into difficulties throughout Committee sittings. It is the old question of Opposition Members seeking advice and checking facts. I perfectly well understand that the Minister will, of course, want to check all sorts of things with Mr. Mark Batho and his other civil servants. That is understandable and arouses no objection, but I do not want to be called to order every time I consult Mr. Graham Bowie, of Lothian region, or someone else who has come to watch the proceedings of the Committee. May we have guidance on Opposition Members' practice of checking facts with people in the Public Gallery who are in the same relationship to us as civil servants are to the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That it depends on the circumstances, but whenever an hon. Member wishes to have a discussion with a person in the Public Gallery, he should do so in the Corridor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Is it possible for hon. Members to take a seat in the Public Gallery to conduct conversations? Presumably, you require us to leave the Committee Room and miss what is said to prevent disruption, but would not it be sufficient for an hon. Member to sit in the Public Gallery to obtain more information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no problem about the passing of notes between the Committee and the Public Gallery, but there is always a problem when hon. Members conduct a prolonged debate with somebody in the Public Gallery. I therefore urge hon. Members who have a matter to discuss at length to do so in the Corridor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. If civil servants are passing
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
information to the Minister on points of fact, may I have a copy as well, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the tradition is that civil servants sit beside the Minister to be able to supply him with information and place him in a better position to respond to questions put to him by hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At long last I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the sittings motion. We should get on with that business, because everyone knows that it is the duty of the Committee to report to the House within a timetable that can be seen to be reasonable. The Bill is important—probably one of the most important Bills in a long time to be considered by a Scottish Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It contains 169 clauses and, of course, deals with many aspects of life in Scotland—not just local government. It was interesting that earlier in the debate the hon. Member for Hamilton introduced some novel reasons for considering the sittings motion. He introduced what I shall call "George's law" which states that all amendments tabled must be voted on regardless of the technical standing of the amendment and the conduct of the debate. That is new to me and it has never happened before on any of the many Standing Committees of which I have been a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other interesting "George's law" related to the absence of hon. Members from Scottish Committees in earlier Parliaments. Only the hon. Member for Hamilton has found reasons for being absent from those Committees. His excuse was that he is interested in foreign affairs. It may surprise him to know that other hon. Members have interests other than in Scottish matters and, quite properly, they have given time and attention to them. The hon. Gentleman's remarks were humbug and we saw them for what they were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the hon. Member for Hamilton is not the only George on the Committee. There are three. I am called George and so is the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch). In future, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will refer to us as George I, George II and George III. I want to be sure that I am not George III because he was mad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should say "Wee Hamilton". That would deal with the matter. I say not to "Wee Hamilton", but to fairly robust and rotund George that we should deal with the issues properly, fully, fairly and effectively. I agree with the hon. Member for Hamilton that the Committee has a duty to study carefully everything in the Bill and to go through it line by line and clause by clause. We can do that only if we move on to the business and deal with the clauses. We cannot do that if we have the sort of interference that delayed the Committee at its previous sitting. Our duty is to get on with considering the Bill, and to do that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your presence, Sir James, I am truly surrounded by unionists even though some are more open about that than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Blackpool, North who said that the Bill is of great interest to the people of England. I am sure that Scottish local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
government reform was not too much to the fore in the hon. Gentleman's election address, but I am sure that the good citizens of Blackpool, North will be in the pubs this weekend and agog as they consider the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he would listen. I hope so because he is a well-known advocate of privatisation. If he listens to the Scottish people, he will realise that we are totally opposed to privatisation and to the sort of water boards that will be established by the Bill. I hope that he will listen to our views and vote against such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow spoke with experience, wisdom and great knowledge of local government. I hope that the Government will heed what he said about COSLA, which has put forward a detailed case that should be answered. If the Committee cannot do that, perhaps the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs would be the forum to do so. The hon. Member for Linlithgow was right: COSLA's case must be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton has temporarily left the Room. I listened with interest to his remarks even though I have had recent difficulties with him and vice versa. He pointed out the many problems and unfairnesses inherent in the Bill. Although we disagree on many matters, we certainly agree about the amount of damage that the Bill could do to Scottish local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Government's inbuilt majority on the Committee and their ruthlessness in using it, it remains to be seen whether the Bill will be amended substantially. The best change would be to scrap the Bill, which is unwanted in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motions gives a clear view of the Government's intentions. Two morning sittings usually suffice to begin with, but even at the outset the Government are slamming on an open-ended afternoon and evening sitting. The Government will use their majority to push through the Bill as soon as possible. Apart from posing problems for hon. Members who travel by sleeper to Edinburgh and Glasgow on Thursday night, of whom I am not one, the open-ended Thursday sitting reveals the Government's plan. Doubtless they will also soon fill the afternoon and evening sitting on Tuesdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a corollary, I hope that due scrutiny will be given to all aspects of the Bill and that the Government will not resort to the guillotine. The Bill must be considered in detail. It is not wanted in Scotland; it will create a mess of Scottish local government and it must be tackled point by point. At the risk of going too far, I must agree with the hon. Member for Hamilton that the Bill is not just one Bill, but three or four Bills. Instead of just one Committee discussing one Bill, there should be three of four Committees scrutinising the details of those three or four Bills. I hope that the 169 clauses and accompanying schedules will be picked apart, seam by seam, throughout our proceedings and will be brought to the attention of the Scottish public so that everyone will know the disastrous effect that the Bill will have on local government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with not just boundaries and services, but water services, water board provisions, tourism and children's panel arrangements, all of which deserve the detailed scrtuiny that is impossible when the Bill is to go through in this form. A wide range of subjects is involved.
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
We are dealing with fundamental services, which are available day by day to every man, woman and child in Scotland. Some services are monopoly services, which people cannot avoid using. Therefore, we should scrutinise the provisions in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should not ideally, have come before the Committee. There should have been more detailed consideration or, at the very least, a commission, as in England, to ensure that, from an examination of boundaries and services, a local government system would emerge which would last not just for 20 years—as did the previous system—but into the future and serve adequately the needs of the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every test of opinion in Scotland has shown outright opposition to the provisions in the Bill relating to the water boards and to water privatisation. I hope that the Government will realise their error. I hope that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North, who is an aficionado of water privatisation, will understand what the Scottish people are saying and will vote to reject that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subjects of local government boundaries, services, tourism, the children's panel and water services cannot be treated properly unless the Committee can examine them in detail, according to an adequate time scale. I hope that the Government will not use the guillotine at any point during our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to have a strange and cavalier attitude toward Scottish legislation. They either shoe horn legislation for Scotland into Bills relating to England and Wales, or concertina three or four Bills into one package. That system cannot cope with the needs of Scottish legislation. The sittings motion and the Bill illustrate reality, because the Conservatives have no mandate and no majority in Scotland. They therefore have to use hon. Members representing English constituencies to create a majority for promoting a Bill that goes against the wishes of the majority of people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The hon. Gentleman is calling into question the right of hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
remarks that I have made about representatives of English constituencies are not directed at hon. Members on a personal basis. In looking at the sittings motion and its consequences, however, we have pointed out the unfairness of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is being rushed through. Its timetable is far too tight. I remember the previous reorganisations and the problems caused by parallel authorities, by overworked and overstretched officials working for two authorities. That is what is being inflicted on the Scottish local government system. The Committee should therefore make sure that the reorganised set-up that is created is capable of providing a suitable and adequate local government service for Scotland. We must avoid the confusions and problems of the previous reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing something that is important to every person in Scotland. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall be finishing shortly when I am sure the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley can contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our sittings will reveal that the Bill proposes not a single tier but a multi-tier and extremely confused set-up. It proposes not decentralisation as the Government maintain but gives greater powers to central Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland in particular. The unwanted water boards get more freedom of action than is being allowed Scotland's democratically elected local government. That is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for having kept the Bill out of Committee for as long as possible. If I had my way, I would keep it in Committee for three or four years but if I really had my way it would be dumped completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We heard an interesting speech from the hon. Member for Angus, East. I respect the hon. Gentleman's views. He is a convinced nationalist. He says that he is worried about delay and lack of time and so on, but an entire morning was wasted earlier this week as a result of a pantomine organised by his party. A full sitting was wasted in the quest for publicity and instant news. What purpose did that serve his party, our party, the Labour party or anyone else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principal point relates to the hon. Gentleman's inclusion in the Committee and his participation in Scottish local government reform. Our actions were designed to delay the start of the Committee for the very reason he is on it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and I can give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking that we are hear to listen. I am a convinced unionist and I do not mean the European Union but the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which includes Scotland. I was pleased to hear remarks from Labour Members who we thought had become slightly wimpish about the Union. We have heard encouraging remarks and look forward to closer co-operation on the Bill than might have been otherwise possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Members should realise that about a fifth, or nearly a quarter, of Scottish Members are represented on the Committee. How on earth do they think that Committees dealing with matters relevant to England—which has more than 500 Members of Parliament—manage with a representation of 20 or 30? One Member in 20 serves on a Committee dealing with English matters, yet Member after Member has spoken as if Scotland is not represented on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Members should try to sit on English Committees. I hope that they do—they would be welcome. Nothing annoys me more than hearing people say, "Why should an English MP sit?" Why should not a Member of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Parliament be on a Scottish Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the situation were reversed and people said, "Should a Scottish Member of Parliament be allowed on an English Committee?" the situation would be so ridiculous and small-minded that everyone would see such arguments as false.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give an undertaking that, no matter how many hours the Committee sits after the trains have left King's Cross for the north on Thursdays, we shall be here examining the Bill line by line. That is a promise. We look forward to examining all 221 pages, all 169 clauses and all 12 schedules, as long as the time is properly used.

We have heard one or two surprising remarks. I am immensely impressed by the Labour party's feelings about the wisdom of the Heath-Walker reforms of 1974 and that it is so much in favour of that method of local government. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There was similar Scottish legislation at the time.

My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has set out for our English colleagues the importance of this issue to Scots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members of the Committee are not anti-English; we are simply anti-Conservative. Conservative Members should not worry that they are sitting among people who think that, because they are English, there is a problem. It is because they are Conservatives that we take issue with them on these key matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton outlined a number of concerns about the Bill that should be debated. If it is approved, the sittings motion will give us the opportunity to debate some of those issues on Tuesdays and Thursdays, perhaps long into the night. I should like to touch on the issues. In the sittings motion debate we should flag up why it is important to approve the motion, and get on with the job. Reference has been made to delays, but now we are in the business of discussing the detail of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason that we support the sittings motion is that I fear that Conservative Members have stolen a march on the Committee's Labour Members, Scottish Nationalists and Liberals. A draft of the Bill was clearly given to a Mr. Jeremy Howard at Tory party headquarters in London. As a consequence, Opposition Members did not have access to any of the details of the clauses until the Bill was published on 9 December. Mr. Howard, speaking loosely, but eloquently, to 	<i>The Scotsman</i> suggested that he received material from the Scottish Office before the Bill was published. Perhaps such action is not contempt of the House, but it seems ridiculous, considering that this is an issue of the greatest sensitivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know whether Ministers or civil servants were responsible—Mr. Howard simply referred to the Scottish Office. To be fair to the civil servants, they said that they did not know who this person was. That leaves the lingering suspicion that material privy to all right hon. and hon. Members of the House was given in a favoured way to Conservative Central Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a great deal of time to discuss the Bill's implications, especially if what I have said is true. We have documentation from Conservative party headquarters to suggest that it was given that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for his support for the sittings motion.
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I can assure him that neither Conservative Central Office nor anyone else improperly received a draft of the Bill before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister gives me a categorical assurance—and I have no reason to doubt him—that a draft Bill was not given to Conservative Central Office, what was given? Was it a list of clauses, or a detailed briefing? That is germane to the need for much debate in the Committee. Jeremy Howard of Conservative party headquarters confirmed that he had been given material prior to the Bill's publication, which allowed Central Office to provide a detailed Conservative briefing that was sold to lobbying firms, but which had all the clauses in the wrong order. I see that I am stretching your tolerance, Sir James. I wanted to raise the issue in Committee because it is very important if my hon. Friends cannot see material which may have been given in a privileged or favoured way to a party organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other issues need rigorous debate in Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton mentioned gerrymandering. It is an issue that we will be able to debate on Tuesdays and Thursdays, long into the night. This reorganisation has nothing to do with the people of Scotland, the 300,000 employees of the service or the 5 million people in Scotland who have some of the best local government services that can be provided. It is simply a case of the Government using taxpayers' money to gerrymander boundaries and seek political favours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that that must be discussed by the Committee. It is part of the Bill. Councils will emerge, such as Stirling and East Renfrewshire, that have been designed to ensure that the Conservative have party advantage. That issue will be discussed under the schedules, but I am sure that you, Sir James, agree that we need to discuss on Tuesdays and Thursdays, long into the night, the important issue of what the Conservatives are really doing in Scotland when they should be tackling its problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we approve the sittings motion we shall also, in debating the Bill, touch upon the matter of costs. They are vital, of course. My hon. Friends have raised some of the issues and we shall return to our discussions this afternoon so I shall not, I hope, need to say much more about it. But the question arises, how, if we approve the sittings motion, are we to discuss the Bill's implications long into the night on Tuesdays and Thursdays if we are provided with such tawdry, shabby, pathetic financial information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the Touche Ross debacle—Touche Ross were the consultants who initially set up the financial debate—through to the memorandum in the Bill, many different ideas and proposed savings have been juxtaposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Especially by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says "Especially by the Opposition." We shall describe later what the Government have been doing. If every there was a back-of-an-envelope job it was this document, which, in its treatment of costs is premised on the flimsiest of commercial and financial considerations. I perceive your
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
tolerance, Sir James, and do not, want to go into detail. We shall expose for what they are the costs set out in the Bill. Costs are not a serious part of the Government's thinking, which is concerned with the ideology behind gerrymandering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue in the Bill needs to be dealt with at some stage in our proceedings. We shall have to discuss the unelected state. Part and parcel of the Bill is the increasing shift from elected authority control to quangos. Of course that is an important matter and Scots will, I am sure, be observing the sittings motion debate in awe and anticipation because it encompasses the subject of quangos. Germane to the sittings motion is the fact that, if the Government set up, as they intend to through the Bill, three super quangos, we shall, for the first time this century, have shifted the balance of finance from the Scottish Office—£14 billion—away from elected authorities and organisations to quangos which will, in the main, be appointed by the Scottish Office. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has often suggested, events such as the Greater Glasgow health board fiasco raise great issues. We are keen to discuss those in the coming sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also germane to the sittings motion is the question of how long we shall be dealing with the Bill. I am sure that my hon. Friends and I would wish to discuss it for as long as it takes to cover 169 clauses—a long time. But what will the Minister be doing about that? He made a brief statement in support of the sittings motion, but he did not go into detail. I hope that he will soon accept the invitation from my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton to say that the Government will not guillotine the Bill. Is the Minister willing, in the interests of Scotland and of good debate, to say that no guillotine will be used? I am a generous man and during the endless debates long into the night we shall want to hear the Minister address these issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall that during the debate on the Floor of the House about the behaviour of the SNP, my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) said that he had been told by the Minister that the Bill would not be guillotined? He had been given that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that, through my hon. Friend, the Minister gave that assurance. It would be helpful to have on record in the Committee or in the House that the Minister is a generous man and would be willing to continue sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays to well beyond Easter. I believe that the Minister is a reasonable man—my hon. Friends will not influence me from praising him—so I hope that our proceedings will go beyond Easter. Surely, the Minister and his hon. Friends do not think that we can debate three or four major Bills in such a short space of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sitting motion is about our proceedings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The quality of the debate on those days will be influenced by how long we debate the issues over the next two to three months. I am sure that the Minister would agree that to sit for only six or seven weeks would put tremendous pressures on our debates on every Tuesday and Thursday, because we would sit late into the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
I hope that the Minister will put on record that, in the interests of Scotland, the Government will not guillotine the Bill and that every clause and subsection will be debated fully. That is what a sittings motion is designed to do. It should give hon. Members the opportunity to discuss the Bill. The Minister is laughing and nodding his head positively so I take it that he is willing to be present on Tuesdays and Thursdays and late into the night to discuss the vital issues that affect Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that you, Sir James, are a tolerant Chairman. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we want to hear Ministers relate how the Government are dealing with the issues. Some constructive comments have been made by English Conservative members of the Committee. They seem to have open minds and the hon. Member for Tayside, North said that he would listen to the arguments. The precedent for that behaviour in Scottish Committees is not good. Conservative Members may make favourable noises at the start of proceedings, but when we reach the nitty-gritty of a Bill, concessions are rarely made even if logical arguments have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish the hon. Gentleman to get things wrong. If he examines Standing Committee records over many Parliaments, he will see that I have often—I mean often—exercised my independent right to vote as I wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in danger of being criticised by my hon. Friends for being over generous. Of course, the hon. Member for Tayside, North will wish to contribute his independent views on such an important Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues in the Bill transcend much of the political knockabout that characterises Committees. Those issues should be taken seriously. On one Tuesday, Thursday and late at night, we may wish to discuss Kincardine. We shall want to discuss that because Kincardine is being stolen from Fife and will be put into Central in order to make sense of Stirling becoming a Tory enclave. Falkirk and Clackmannan will then be left in a ridiculous position, without a road link, so it will receive a piece of Fife to facilitate that. You are shaking your head, Sir James, but I wanted to make it clear that we shall want to return to that point. I am sure that hon. Members want Kincardine to be retained by Fife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that the Minister has never explained to him the connections between Oakley in Fife and Camelon in Falkirk?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issues to be discussed by the Committee are vital and I was delighted to see its proceedings are being followed by Archbishop Thomas Winning. Education will be a crucial matter. The archbishop represents a powerful body of opinion and the Government will ignore at their peril the serious concerns that have been expressed. I am sure that we shall continue to have a dialogue with the archbishop and that the Minister will warmly welcome his presence in the House today, which adds an important flavour to our proceedings. I thank you for your tolerance, Sir James, but I think that I kept to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I do not ask for a full answer as that would be unreasonable, but will the Minister comment on the questions that I asked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
about the discussions with the Catholic Church? What is the view of the Scottish Office—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The sittings motion refers to the day and the time of the sitting, but does not mention the place. Would it be possible for the Committee to meet in a place other than the Palace of Westminster if it so desired?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee could consider doing that, it would have to get the permission of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
