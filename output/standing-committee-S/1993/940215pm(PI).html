Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) said, is a regular occurrence when I get to my feet. If I were able to refer to it, I would say that the people there are distinguished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) said that my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) was aware of this amendment being tabled. He may have been aware of it being tabled, but that does not mean that he was happy about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is astonishing. If the hon. Gentleman was not happy about the amendment being tabled, why did he waste everyone's time by leading a delegation to see me to put forward a case that is precisely the one being put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the oportunity to explain. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale, like all good democrats, wants all cases to be heard by the Minister. He represents Clydesdale and he has a responsibility to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
ensure that the Minister hears all cases, so he availed himself of that opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does not the hon. Gentleman extend that principal and take the view that if such a case should be heard by a Minister, it should also be heard by members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale represents the area and has been to see the Minister, I assume that the Minister had a responsibility to pay attention to what the Clydesdale delegation said, and should have reported it to the Committee and assessed its recommendations and suggestions. It is not the responsibility of rogue Back Benchers to table such amendments. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Some Conservative Members are awfully sensitive. The hon. Member for Ayr has a broad enough back to take these gentle comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I point out to the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr Kynoch) that I was using the term as an adjective and not as a noun; that is a very important difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I agree with you: I have heard worse, particularly from the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been called a likeable rogue: I object to the word likeable, so we will have to stop that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr, in advocating the case for Clydesdale, said that a poll had been carried out. He would not, however, let my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) ask the crucial question about the result of the poll, because although 59 per cent. of people took part and more than 26,000 people voted, the majority in favour of an independent Clydesdale—an opt out—was only 184. That figure may be significant to the hon. Member for Ayr because it is double his majority, but it is not a very large majority as far as most people are concerned. It shows that the people of Clydesdale were roughly equally divided about whether to opt out or to opt in. I hope that that has put the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given his previous responses, the Minister may be sympathetic to the point that I am making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to refer to "The Case for Clydesdale—management of regional service", which has been sent to us by councillor Robert McMillan, who is the leader of Clydesdale council. I understand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
that it was prepared by the chief executive. It reads:
	<br><q><p>"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a unitary Clydesdale council would be able to deliver all the services currently provided by Strathclyde Regional Council that are to be transferred".</p></q>
I have examined the paper carefully, as a former regional councillor, and it manifestly fails in that purpose. There are no arguments in the paper that convince me that services will be delivered efficiently and effectively under the proposal. Two or three examples will demonstrate that. The first is education. I shall not dwell on the fact that there are only four secondary schools in the area, although it stretches the bounds of credibility that we should have a full-blown education authority with a director of education and the rest of the structure to run only four secondary schools. The paper talks about what it describes as the "residue" of 15 per cent. of the present expenditure in Clydesdale. That makes it sound as if it is an afterthought and of no great consequence. But it includes special education provision for the mentally and physically handicapped. As far as I am concerned, that is not a residue; it is vitally important. It includes advisory services. They are not a residue; they are a vitally important part of education. It includes psychological services. As a graduate in psychology—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That explains a lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. That does explain a lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Psychological services cannot be described as a residue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend would need a qualification in psychiatry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) has taken the words out of my mounth. I trained in psychology, which is the study of the normal mind. Psychiatry is the study of the abnormal mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another part of the residue is pupils' transport from home to school. Let us consider the controversy about such transport at present. There is rightly controversy because a young person was killed in my constituency as a result of current problems relating to school transport. This is a very important issue. Strathclyde is generous in its provision for school transport; that provision is way above the national average. So that is what the residue consists of. I find it strange that the Clydesdale chief executive, as I understand it, considers such functions to be the residue of services. The paper suggests that psychology services
	<br><q><p>"could be bought in from the proposed North Lanarkshire Council or could be provided jointly with a Hamilton-East Kilbride Council."</p></q>
If such services are to be provided by joint arrangement with the council from which Clydesdale proposes to split, why should it split away in the first
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
place? Why should not it stay as part of that council and provide those services within a unitary authority? The report continues:
	<br><q><p>"The school functions remaining to be administered centrally"—once they have hived things off, passed them on to joint boards or asked someone else to take responsibility for them—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"would be the responsibility of a small team of education officers. There need only be a small core education dept, which might well be integrated with other personal social services, to provide a new approach to the delivery of such services".</p></q>
My analysis is that that is not a new approach to the delivery of such services. To let schools have control of their own affairs, as happened under the old school boards, to cut down the advisory and specialist services and to hack away at services for the mentally and physically handicapped will take us back to the 19th century, not forward to the 21st century. The scenario painted by Clydesdale council in its proposal is worrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the argument my hon. Friend is developing. From his analysis, would he expect a unitary Clydesdale authority to do away with the education committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only conclusion that we can draw. That means that there would be no direct discussion of education policy in Clydesdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nursery and community education would be farmed out principally to the voluntary sector. I have a great respect for the voluntary sector. Before I came here, I worked for Age Concern Scotland, dealing with the elderly and, prior to that, I worked for Enterprise Youth, concerned with community service done by young people. But I do not think that the voluntary sector can replace statutory provision in the way that Clydesdale proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states that the most important area in social work is community care. The social work department is the lead department in providing community care, dealing with all aspects of community care, including the health board. The health board in Lanarkshire covers the whole of Lanarkshire, so one small authority in the south of Lanarkshire—I accept that Clydesdale is an important area, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale keeps reminding me—will be the lead authority in providing community care, working with the huge Lanarkshire health board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states:—
	<br><q><p>"The social market in health is still in its infancy." I wish that the social market in health had been stifled at birth.</p></q>
The report continues:—
	<br><q><p>"By contrast there is already a substantial private market in social welfare."</p></q>
That is one of the worries, if that is the way in which social welfare is progressing. In my constituency, a private nursing home is going into liquidation because it is no longer making money, and the old people are being thrown on to the streets. The Ayr
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
division of the Strathclyde social work department has looked after them extremely well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman advise us of the particular location where these old people were thrown on to the streets? Presumably, from what the hon. Gentleman said, they were abandoned. Is not that an example of the hon. Gentleman's total exaggeration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Member for Ayr would listen. I said that the old people's home in Kirkmichael went into liquidation and that the people were thrown on to the streets, or would have been if—[HON. MEMBERS: "Ah".] All right, a semantic difference. I then said that they would have been thrown on to the streets if it had not been for the social work department of Strathclyde, in the Ayr division. If the enabling authority relied only on private health care, private nursing homes and private old people's homes, people would be on the streets because there would be no safety net of the social work department to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members, including the hon. Member for Ayr, mentioned value for money. The business community has mentioned that it supports Clydesdale, although I notice that the hon. Gentleman did not pay much attention to the business community's view of Ayrshire. One of the advantages of Strathclyde, what I hope would be one of the advantages of an Ayrshire authority—if we can agree it at a later stage—and what would be one of the advantages of a south Lanarkshire authority is that they would be big enough to have the purchasing power to get many goods and services from surrounding areas. They could bargain from suppliers to strike good deals. That could not be done by a small authority the size of Clydesdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not discuss highways because the criticisms about them could be even more devastating. I hope that I have given my hon. Friends, and perhaps the Minister and some Conservative members, a clear indication that it is impossible for an authority the size of Clydesdale to attempt to cover the range of services currently delivered effectively and efficiently by Strathclyde region. I hope that the amendment will be strongly and overwhelmingly rejected by the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has made a forthright speech, but I must part company with him because he has been arguing on the issue of size and ignoring the issue of proportion. Mere size does not solve every problem; the key to progress is good management, with whatever level of resources is available, through councils appropriate to, and representative of, their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This time I do see a solution for Clydesdale—, through cost effectiveness, service delivery and local support across all parties and sections of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
I support Clydesdale's bid to become a unitary authority. The community does not want to lose its identity in a large, remote and, to it, unwanted south Lanarkshire. Clydesdale is different in character from the remainder of the proposed council. Clydesdale has a large rural area with a sparse population and a geography and economy distinctly different from the more industrialised and heavily populated parts of Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing district council has reflected those differences and delivered services in a style and manner totally suited to its demographic needs. In housing, its maintenance expenditure is the second highest in Scotland, yet its rents are low. Ninety-seven per cent. of Clydesdale's housing stock has full central heating and it has developed a decentralised administrative system. Clydesdale district has a national reputation for its approach to management and for its services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is precisely because of that community-based, sensitive service provision that I support Clydesdale as a unitary authority. The smaller population ceases to become a drawback when allied to a management and service delivery structure that provides value for money and meets exactly the needs of its communities. Instead of being a mere southern fringe of what would be a large urban-based system, Clydesdale would be at the centre, and be an authority that delivered quality services exactly suited to the needs of its client population. That type of quality service is at the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no doubt about the support given to the idea for Clydesdale across all political parties, and by the majority of the people in a referendum, to which the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred. The majority said yes, but it is important to be aware of the question that was answered. When public opinion sampling elsewhere in the country asks simply "Are you in favour of the Government's proposals?", the usual response is a massive no. If that question has been asked in Clydesdale, I have no doubt that the answer would also have been a resounding no.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clydesdale referendum was designed for an entirely different purpose. Clydesdale council did not want to turn its referendum into a test on the Government's views. It wished to ascertain what support existed for a Clydesdale single-tier authority. It asked:
	<br><q><p>"Are you in favour of the establishment of a unitary council for the area presently covered by Clydesdale district?"</p></q>
That positive proposal achieved majority support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be said with absolute certainty that those who voted yes strongly favoured a unitary Clydesdale authority. The minority no vote could probably be further divided into several categories. Some would oppose south Lanarkshire and some would oppose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
any reorganisation. Who can tell? What was clear beyond doubt was the majority vote of confidence for Clydesdale as one of the new unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the quality of service that is so important—a service supplied by a method appopriate to the area and communities that the council services. Size alone is not important, good management and quality service are also important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Clydesdale do not wish to be part of a large south Lanarkshire, as the Government proposed originally. A unitary Clydesdale, on its own record, on merit and past performance, offers efficient locally based services that are cost effective and exactly suited to the needs and nature of local communities—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is clear that some hon. Members have no idea what it is like to live under a well-run smaller authority. That is a pity, because they could learn a great deal if they applied some of the good management techniques to larger authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will listen to Clydesdale's well-argued case. I support its bid to retain its very distinct identity and its own local government provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some additional points to those raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. In its submission, Clydesdale mentioned a residue of 15 per cent. and the things that the council could pick up with the money. I presume that the hon. Member for Ayr realises that the 15 per cent. residue would have to pay for secondary Roman Catholic education. At present, a different area of Strathclyde pays for that. It is inappropriate to describe Catholic secondary education as a "residue". It would be marginalised by the proposal, especially when we consider its attendant transport costs. It would be tempting to make cuts to Catholic secondary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for a small authority to maintain a wide range of professional education services. I accept that big is not necessarily beautiful and that services do not always improve with size. However, there is a point at which an authority is too small to make viable educational provision. An authority of 58,000 people seems absurdly small to try to run the necessary range of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry that, in financially tight circumstances, the most important attendant social services, such as footwear and clothing grants, discretionary school transport, subsidies for school meals, and bursaries would be cut. The local authority currently has some discretion over such services, but those services would be cut if the authority was forced to concentrate on its core provision. An enormous range of joint arrangements would have to be made, and small authorities would not be able to operate them cost effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
Joint arrangements would have to be made for special educational needs, psychological services, and educational development services. There would be no teachers resource centre in Clydesdale and no residential centres for people who have behavioural problems. The under-fives, community education and careers services would be operated by joint boards or sharing arrangements, but those arrangements would not be as cost-effective as the services that larger authorities can provide. Disproportionate overheads would detract from the core provisions and the discretionary elements would go by the board. Clydesdale would not be able to provide the quality of education that its pupils and parents desire and deserve. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr for tabling the amendments. He has the general support of the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). I am at a loss to understand the criticism of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. He believes that it is right and reasonable for the hon. Member for Clydesdale to bring a delegation to meet me and present the case that the Committee is considering. He then claims that it is for the Government or the Opposition Front Bench to examine and present the case. That is the new Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley doctrine: no Back Bencher has the right to table amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case. I drew attention to a pattern of circumstantial evidence. One Back Bencher tables the amendments. Such an occurrence seems strange. A random distribution of amendments tabled by Back Benchers would be reasonable. However, there seems to be some inspiration—perhaps it comes from St. Andrew's house—behind the series of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one considers the speeches made by Scottish Labour Members of Parliament on a range of topics, one finds that the distribution is not random. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley would come top of any such league.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend the Minister notice that, before we broke for lunch, the hon. member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley launched a tirade against my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr for speaking in an area outside his own constituency? The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to attack the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley personally. I am merely trying to establish why he has taken such exception to the perfectly reasonable subject for discussion raised by a Conservative Back-Bench Member. That subject was put forward by an authority whose majority is Labour; it is not a Conservative authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons why I spoke is that my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale is not a member of the Committee. He wanted his views expressed to the Minister, which I did on my hon. Friend's behalf. Moreover, the Labour party does not hold the majority in Clydesdale. It has seven of the seats. The majority of the members do not belong to Labour, although there are Labour chairmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disputing that. I thought that I said that Labour was the majority party—it is the biggest party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us not cross swords on that point. My understanding of the political balance on that authority is that there are seven Labour councillors, five Conservative or independent councillors and four Scottish National party councillors. My general point is that a case was advanced by a Back-Bench member of the Committee. It was supported vigorously by the Scottish National party, but the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley took exception to it. The hon. Gentleman said that it should be advanced by a Government or Opposition spokesman. That is an astonishing principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley normally is most courteous. Uncharacteristically, I agree with some of the points in the hon. Gentleman's speech. I shall come to those points later, but the hon. Gentleman's sneering contempt for the Clydesdale submission was without precedent. When I met the Clydesdale delegation, I found their case for a single-tier council based on existing district boundaries to be well considered. The delegation had thought hard about the problems of delivering the strategic services currently delivered by Strathclyde region. Members of the delegation pointed to their experience of working jointly with other authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had an equally interesting meeting about Clydesdale with the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) and a delegation from Motherwell district council. They argued strongly in favour of a combined Motherwell and Clydesdale authority. That option is not before the Committee, as no hon. Member chose to submit it for discussion. It is entirely up to hon. Members to decide what amendments they table. I made it clear to that delegation, as I have to others, that, technical amendments apart, the Government do not intend to table major amendments to the map during the Committee stage of the Bill. Obviously, in theory, Report stage is different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In enunciating the Government's strategy for the Bill,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
why is the Minister ruling out the possibility of the Government tabling any amendments to the schedule while we are in Committee? We all know that the Government control what happens in Committee because they have a majority, so why, in spite of the representations, is he ruling out tabling amendments in Committee, but not on Report? What is the thinking behind that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.00 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Government cannot rule out tabling amendments on Report. I have said—there is no secret about it because I have said it to delegations—that unless the Government are convinced that there is a 100 per cent. and overwhelming case for a particular boundary change, we will look to Members to table amendments in Committee. It is clear from virtually every debate that we have had on boundaries that 100 per cent. certainty is not usually the name of the game. There are cases to be made on both sides of an argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now wish to praise the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. This is where he gets nailed to the wall. When he got past his opening remarks, he made some sensible points about the delivery of services in a South Lanarkshire authority. Our policy is to encourage decentralisation to ensure that decisions affecting Clydesdale are taken there. The Committee should take seriously a number of points that the hon. Gentleman made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not, however, go quite as far as the hon. Gentlemen in saying that an authority with a population of 58,500 would necessarily be unable to deliver services. That is not the position in Strathclyde or that of the Labour party. It has already tabled amendments and divided the Committee on the proposal to take Helensburgh out of Argyll, which would leave Argyll with a population of 66,000. The population would also be much more widely spread than in Clydesdale. So the argument on population is not necessarily decisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr made the case for Clydesdale, supported by the hon. Member for Angus, East. There is a theoretical alternative case concerning Motherwell and Clydesdale, but that is not before the Committee. Instead, the proposal for a South Lanarkshire authority is the sensible alternative. I do not wholly reject the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr and the hon. Member for Angus, East; they may wish to withdraw the amendment so that we can return to the issue at a later stage. On balance, I cannot recommend the amendment to the Committee—so perhaps my hon. Friend will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little sad that the Minister was not prepared to grasp the nettle. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the Government's response to the previous proposal, I suspect that they will give a similar answer to my amendment. I am puzzled by their attitude and would have thought that they would have had the idea clear in their mind. I do not understand why the Minister has to undertake further consultations because he must be sure of the proposition that has been put to him and whether a council of such a size would work. Perhaps he wants a Motherwell-Clydesdale amendment. I am not sure what he requires, especially as he has known the arguments in favour of the amendment and authorities such as Clydesdale for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the matter will not be shuffled for discussion at a later stage. Up to now the Government have made clear decisions for or against amendments, which is satisfactory.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the best interests of the hon. Gentleman, I hope that he is not suggesting that the Government should always say "no" rather than "maybe".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more used to "no" than "may be", but have liked the occasional "yes" that we have heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides for a Cumbernauld and Kilsyth unitary authority. I am sure of the total opposition locally to the proposed North Lanarkshire authority. It would be a vast, unfair and unworkable system for the population of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, which does not want it. Though Cumbernauld residents do not want to be lumped into a giant authority containing Monklands and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
Motherwell, that is as nothing to the alarm felt in Kilsyth at the self-same prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of the strength of feeling in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth against the North Lanarkshire proposal; it is backed by a 5,100 signature petition that demands the retention of local control of affairs in an all-purpose authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is a relatively new local government unit, but it has firmly established its community base and is a distinct, recognisable entity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks of the strength of public opinion in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, but his amendment's provisions go beyond that area. Where is the public support for splitting Strathkelvin? In particular, will he say whether the Scottish National party branches in Strathkelvin have been consulted about and agree with his amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was acting on the information that was made available to me and suggested such support. If the hon. Gentleman has evidence, I would be happy to hear it. I have heard evidence today that is interesting and I shall investigate it further. I am acting on local evidence that I have received and am assured of the total opposition to the North Lanarkshire proposal—I want to oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local opinion is that Cumbernauld and Kilsyth should continue as a unitary authority. The area has a case because it has an established track record of providing good quality services that are suited to its population. It has an established management system and existing services would be cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Merging with North Lanarkshire would be costly for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. Compared to Monklands, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth pays considerably less council tax. There is a big difference—£146 and £200 for a Band D house, and £78 up to £ 132 for a Band C house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth paid considerably less poll tax, but after amalgamation with the massive North Lanarkshire authority it would no longer be able to benefit from its efficient service provision. Its population would make it bigger than the eight other proposed authorities and comparable to councils already agreed by the Government, albeit with the caveat in their previous decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Chryston have already been formed into a schools consortium and share local resources. St. Maurice's high on the western edge of Cumbernauld has the Chryston area as its main catchment source, and councillor Charles Gray argued in favour of that arrangement with Cumbernauld and Kilsyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Excellent road and rail public transport exists for Cumbernauld via Moodiesburn, Muirhead and Stepps.

As Bearsden and Milngavie have publicly opposed joining with Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, a unitary authority based on Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is an option that has public support in the district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, who is way out of his depth. He referred to councillor Charles Gray supporting something. Members of the Committee and people outside might get the impression that the councillor was promoting the hon. Gentleman's eccentric idea; in fact, he is violently opposed to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Charles Gray, who represents Chryston, supports the amendments tabled by the Opposition, the effect of which would be that the whole of Strathkelvin and the whole of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth would become part of the east Dumbartonshire—renamed Lennox—authority. If the hon. Gentleman was even implying support for his idea, he is entirely wrong. Everyone in that area—the Scottish National party and all the community councils—rejects the formulation proposed by him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not imply that councillor Charles Gray supported my amendment—clearly, he does not. I was pointing out existing arrangements that would be in tune with my amendment. There is a difference in configuration between my amendment and that of the Labour party, but both are opposed to Cumbernauld and Kilsyth being in north Lanarkshire. I would accept the Labour amendment as a fall-back position, but I am arguing for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth as a unitary authority. That is the case that I am advancing, but I would accept any amendment that would keep Cumbernauld and Kilsyth out of north Lanarkshire, as the people do not want that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is giving the impression that his amendment has won support in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. I have a copy of a letter addressed to the hon. Gentleman from Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council, which says:
	<br><q><p>"I have to advise you that this is contrary to the wishes of this authority."</p></q>
A letter from Strathkelvin district council states:
	<br><q><p>"I have been instructed to write to you protesting that this action is contrary to the express wishes of this District Council."</p></q>
I know that my hon. Friend the Member of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) has written to the hon. Member for Angus, East in terms that can barely be repeated in Committee. What is the hon. Gentleman up to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to repeat the terms of that letter, he is quite entitled to do so. It is beneath contempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party, by deliberate policy, has ruled out any present district authority being a new unitary authority. That is a policy hook on which the Labour party is hung. I am not a Labour party member. It is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
the hon. Gentleman's problem, not mine. If a Labour-controlled authority puts forward that view, it is reiterating Labour policy. I am not in Parliament to follow Labour policy, as is the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Retaining the existing council would give direct access to council officials, rather than trailing across to Coatbridge or Motherwell. There is virtually no public transport to the Monklands area, which poses major problems for people who need to get to and from Monklands hospital. Linking Cumbernauld and Kilsyth with north Lanarkshire would only exacerbate those problems. Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council has an excellent record of good quality provision across the entire range of services. Such a council would involve no more joint boards than would be required for any north Lanarkshire scenario.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the wind-up of the Cumbernauld Development Corporation, a pool of talented staff will be available to the council, which would remain a truly locally-based council, providing employment prospects for local school leavers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I am very familiar with the three wards mentioned as an addition to Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. I hoped that the hon. Gentleman would cite the logic behind the three wards being added to Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district as a unitary authority. My in-laws live in that area and I spent a long time in the Moodiesburn Muirhead area. I cannot understand the logic of putting three distinct parts of Strathkelvin into Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, while continuing to argue that there should be a unitary authority. Does the author of the amendment have some relatives whom he wants to include in the district? There is no relationship between Cumbernauld and those areas. It does not make sense. Will the hon. Gentleman further explain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened to what I said earlier, he would have heard me mention transportation and education ties and other arrangements extant between Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Chryston. I can expand on that point if he wishes. Local opinion favours a Cumbernauld and Kilsyth council, and is totally opposed to north Lanarkshire. Any reasonable amendment would be preferable to Cumbernauld and Kilsyth being absorbed into north Lanarkshire. I do not want the Committee to dispatch Cumbernauld and Kilsyth into history without my speaking in its support.

Since its inception, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth has had an excellent record as a good local council. Its record and history deserve someone to speak in its defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to amendment No. 27, I shall say a few words about

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
amendment No. 122, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Angus, East and which I recommend the Committee rejects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have attempted to find common ground and have been remarkably successful in so doing. The normal rules of politics have not been suspended. Therefore, when the hon. Member for Angus, East proposes a measure with which we do not agree—in fact, we find it ludicrous and beyond belief—we are compelled to say so. On the rare occasion that the hon. Gentleman felt the same about one of our proposals, he would take advantage of it in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, the hon. Member for Angus, East suffers from intimidation by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). Even when he is not physically in the Committee Room, his presence is still there, sitting behind the hon. Gentleman and telling him what to do, but not today. Today, it is somebody else entirely. The looming presence is not the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan but ex-Provost Gordon Murray, who is standing behind him pulling the strings. The ex-Provost brings to mind the old expression, "But would you want to live next door to him?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That looming presence offers the hon. Gentleman no good advice or information. He has sold him a pup. I fear for the reputation of the hon. Member for Angus, East now that he has been forced to make a case that will bring ridicule on him and his party in at least one part of the area that he identified in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am compelled to draw the Committee's attention to the matter because the hon. Gentleman advanced a case for unitary status for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council. As other members of the Committee put that case, it seemed an exceptional view to advance. The Scottish National party motion on Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council, which considered the matter, said that the unitary authority should be based on Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council and those parts of Strathkelvin district council that wished to join them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It entered the caveat. The hon. Member for Angus, East has tabled an amendment that would rope in a series of communities that not only do not want to be part of a unitary authority based in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth but were not asked about it. Had they been asked, they would have replied, "Certainly not. We do not want to be part of that unitary authority." If the hon. Member for Angus, East had bothered to lift the telephone to speak to the Strathkelvin SNP, he would have found out what I discovered at lunchtime today. Strathkelvin SNP does not agree with the idea of the areas in Strathkelvin being associated with the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East said that he did not know fully, but that it was his understanding. If he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
is relying on the authority of Gordon Murray, I must tell him that that is not good enough. I am sure that Strathkelvin SNP would be glad to tell him its views. I know most of the villages in the area because I used to live there. The people in the villages of Chryston, Muirhead, Moodiesburn, Banton, Queenzieburn, Croy and even the town of Kilsyth do not want the formulation that is being offered by the hon. Member for Angus, East. Those in Strathkelvin do not want Stathkelvin to be broken up. Had they been asked, they would not have supported the hon. Gentleman's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a small element in the new town of Cumbernauld in the control of ex-Provost Gordon Murray who believe in the hon. Gentleman's proposals. I feel sorry for him for having been sold a case that is unsustainable and which will not gain him the popularity that was presumable the main design of his proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Angus, East has said that he will vote for the amendment as a fall-back position. Fall back is certainly what will happen as amendment No. 122 disappears beneath the waves. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman will support it. I hope that the strength of the case that has been argued by Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council, and the elements that were left out from Strathkelvin, will persuade the Government that the matter should be resolved this afternoon. I advocate that Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council and the whole of Strathkelvin district council should be added to the area that the Government propose to call East Dumbartonshire. Their case is strong and it should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth has never been part of Lanarkshire; it has always been part of Dumbartonshire. It was one of the peculiarities of the local government geography of Scotland over many years that Cumbernauld was in that detached element of Dumbartonshire; it was physically separated from the rest of the Dumbartonshire. Before achieving burgh status in the reorganisation of the 1970s, its services were provided by Dumbarton county council. After the formation of Strathclyde regional council and the district council, services other than district services were provided by the Dumbarton division of the regional council. We could say that the old county council set-up continued. The services were not provided by the Lanark provision of Strathclyde region. More recently, social work administration moved to Monklands and health services, through the Lanarkshire health board, were provided from locations in Lanarkshire. However, the people of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth would have always preferred their health provision to come from the Greater Glasgow health board. That is no disrespect to the excellent Monklands district general hospital or any other Lanarkshire hospital. That is simply a reflection of the origin of the population of Cumbernauld, coming as they do largely from the city of Glasgow. Likewise, Kilsyth has had a long historical attachment to Glasgow's hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
Although the administration of medical services has been through the Lanarkshire health board, the reality is that, because of those historical patterns, people from Cumbernauld and Kilsyth have gravitated towards the Glasgow hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lanarkshire and the towns of Motherwell, Coatbridge and Airdrie, which form the bulk of the north Lanarkshire area as proposed, have never been associated with the provision of local government services for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. Moreover, those locations are not easily reached by public transport from either Cumbernauld or Kilsyth. Local people do not use services, such as shopping, at any of those town centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kilsyth, which was hitherto—that is, before local government reorganisation in the 1970s—part of Stirlingshire, has a long and close association with Kirkintilloch and Strathkelvin since reorganisation but, again, it has no historical or practical relationship with Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abvious new authority for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth would be the council that was identified in the White Paper as East Dumbartonshire. Under that authority, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth would continue as part of the geographical and administrative area to which it has always been related. That community has been excluded from East Dumbartonshire because it would distort the aim of the Government to produce what they optimistically consider would be a Tory-dominated council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that end, the Government have created a hybrid authority called East Dumbartonshire, and have excluded not only the natural component of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, but that part of Strathkelvin which is represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke). It goes without saying that all its local authority seats are filled by Labour party councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correct solution is an East Dumbartonshire authority, which includes all of Strathkelvin, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. I am sure that even the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) would agree that the most popular name for the new authority would be Lennox. Most people agree that that would be the best title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That view is share by Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council and was expressed in the council's paper that was persuasively presented to the Secretary of State before publication of the Government's White Paper. It is also shared by Strathkelvin district council, which has made its wishes absolutely clear both to the Minister and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the only sentiment that has been expressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) by community councils and those individuals who wrote to him. My hon. Friend has made extensive inquiries into the matter. He has taken considerable soundings and his view is based
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
not on a few anecdotal telephone calls, but on a careful and thorough background study of the feelings of his constituents and people in the neighbouring areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>People in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth are clear that they should argue for proposals that are right for the delivery of local authority services; services that have regard to where they have come from in the past and where they come from at present. I am referring to proposals that are based on the expressed view of the elected local authority and of local communities which have made their opinions known through their community councils, and of individuals who have let their opinions be known to the local Member of Parliament and, for that matter, directly to the Secretary of State. After all, that is what democracy is about. If one takes into account the views expressed by the Minister in previous boundary debates, the proposal should appeal to him, given the criteria that he has already outlined.</p>
	<p>The amendments would provide for a new authority to be made up of Strathkelvin, Bearsden and Milngavie along with Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. Bearsden and Milngavie is essentially a residential area. Strathkelvin is an excellent administrative and commercial centre and Cumbernauld is a new town at the forefront of manufacturing in the new high-technology industries.</p>
	<p>The amendments would provide a well-balanced, well-focused community that has a basis in social history and development and a basis in the economic life of central Scotland. Above all, the amendments have the support of local people. I, therefore, commend amendment No. 27 and its consequential amendments to the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had another stimulating debate on boundaries, about which, it is obvious to the Committee, no clear consensus has emerged about what the new structure should be. The Committee has heard the strongly-held view of the hon. Member for Hamilton that Cumbernauld and Kilsyth should be included in the new East Dumbartonshire authority. That view was expressed when in December I met the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and a local delegation who pointed out particularly the problems of transport links in the proposed new North Lanarkshire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those points were reinforced yesterday when I met the hon. Members for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, for Monklands, West and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). Popular support has been expressed for that option, perhaps most notably in the form of a postcard campaign mounted by Kilsyth community council.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
The petition mentioned by the hon. Member for Angus, East has been discussed. I believe that that was organised by the local Scottish National party branch and it contained, I can confirm, 5,000 signatures. It was backed by a significant number of letters—well over 200—in favour of the argument put to the Committee by the hon. Member for Angus, East, for a new authority based on the existing district, but possibly also to include neighbouring parts of Strathkelvin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hamilton suggested, we have also received representations from the people of the Chryston area—or the "southern corridor" of Strathkelvin, as it has been called—who do not wish their area to be separated from the rest of Strathkelvin, although it is fair to point out that prior to 1975, parts of Strathkelvin fell within the former county of Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also of relevance to the debate, however, are the views of other areas that would be affected by the amendments. I am thinking particularly about Bearsden and Milngavie. Bearsden and Milngavie district council originally argued for a district council based on its own boundaries. As the hon. Member for Hamilton and I would probably agree, that is not, on balance, a sensible solution, despite the strength with which it was argued by the council. As he said, it is a relatively small and suburban authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received a range of submissions from the area, to the effect that people did not want to be part of an authority whose centre of gravity would lie too far to the east. The views of the district council, on what the hon. Gentleman rightly called the "Lennox option", are stated on page 9 of its submission:—
	<br><q><p>"the … Lennox proposals result in an elongated region orientated east to west and it has been pointed out elsewhere that public transport in those directions is difficult and sparse."</p></q>
The Committee must take those views into account in making decisions about that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's decision to establish a North Lanarkshire authority was based in part on the consideration that I have described, and in part on other considerations. We were keen to create strong and powerful authorities as a counterbalance to the cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just made a powerful argument in favour of an all-Ayrshire authority. Why, therefore, did he not accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the time that the hon. Gentleman had put forward a reasoned case for an all-Ayrshire authority, but that the balance of arguments was against it. Ayrshire is some little distance from Glasgow, as I am sure that he will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not agree with that proposition, I shall give way to him, but it is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that the northern Ayrshire boundary is contiguous with Eastwood and is not far from Glasgow. Newton Mearns is only about five or 10 minutes by motor car from the boundary of Glasgow. Similarly, Largs and Skelmorlie in the northern part of Ayrshire are close to the western part of Glasgow. The principle that the Minister adduced of counterbalancing the cities in relation to their dealings with central Government and their power within Scotland is a good one. All the scattered little authorities that the Minister seems to be willing to consider will not have that kind of influence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree entirely with the point of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, which he made in the previous debate. A number of factors must be taken into account. I think that members of the Committee from across the party divide recognise that there is a balance to be struck. A major factor that we took into account was the need to create some strong and powerful authorities as a counterbalance to the cities. That does not mean that Glasgow must be surrounded by only one or two powerful authorities, but we need to have some authorities in the west of Scotland. The proposed North Lanarkshire authority, with a population of well over 300,000, clearly falls into that category. It has the potential to become a centre of excellence and to provide specialist services—a point that Labour Members have emphasised before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point of the hon. Member for Hamilton about where people would prefer the health board boundaries to be. We were conscious that the inclusion of Cumbernauld new town within North Lanarkshire authority would give the authority what I would describe as a health mix of new and traditional industries. Of course there is a focus on development and partnership in Monklands and Motherwell that has been effective in several respects, but the new town will be a considerable focus for future growth. The proposed new authority would give North Lanarkshire a strong and balanced economic base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not realise that when he speaks in those terms, he sends a shiver down the spine of all the people who have been listening to the Government promising a revival for Motherwell and a massive initiative to replace the economy of the steel industry with the new economy in the south? He now seems to be saying that the Government will rely on sucking some cash from Cumbernauld. The Government should not be saying that when the fruits of their labours in Motherwell have not been of the order that they promised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not what I am saying. I am clearly not saying that the wind-up of Cumbernauld new town itself is on our agenda. The new powerful authority proposed would have within it a range of traditional and new industries. That point would be generally accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
The hon. Member for Hamilton asked me about the Chryston area. The proposed boundary closely follows the former county boundary, although the line we have drawn keeps Lenzie in one authority. That was not simply a response to representations we received during the consultation process. For a long period representations were received asking that Lenzie, one way or another, be joined in one authority and not split. It is also worth noting that that boundary approximates closely to the Monklands, West parliamentary constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that hon. Members will recognise that there are no easy answers. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred to the fact that prior to 1975 there was the oft-quoted Dumbartonshire detached, a part of the former county which was entirely separate from rest of Dumbartonshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consideration of boundary matters is bound to be an ongoing process as the Bill proceeds through Parliament and the evidence is conflicting, but I believe that on balance our proposed structure is the right one. I cannot therefore recommend a change to the Committee now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reflect on what hon. Members have said, but that is against a background—I wish to be honest with the Committee—of no commitment to change. Hon. Members may or may not wish to withdraw their amendments—if they pushed them to Divisions, I would have to aks my hon. Friends to vote against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response continues a pattern to which we have become accustomed and poses several serious questions about the way in which the Committee is proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister may be listening and balancing the arguments, although to be fair most of the scripts from which he is reading seem to have been prepared before the Committee sittings. It may be that well-researched documents can be produced in advance. Clever civil servants may be able to produce a number of papers from which the Minister selects paper one, two, three or four, according the the quality of the Opposition's argument. As my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley says, we are finding ourselves in a dilemma. The Minister said that we need large authorities to balance the power of the cities. He then read out a list of criteria and talked about the North Lanarkshire council, using descrptions that easily fit the model of the old Ayrshire authority, which Opposition Members favoured for that part of the world. Instead, the Minister went for three authorities for Ayrshire. Far from going for strong authorities to balance the cities, he has gone for the fragmentation of Ayrshire. That produces an illogicality in my mind and, I am sure, in the minds of many people outside the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Opposition Members felt strongly that there should be an old Ayrshire authority, why did they not force a vote on the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who failed to spell, as it were, the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire)—the English spelling is "Rachel" rather than "Raquel"—is in some trouble. If the hon. Gentleman knew Committee procedure, he would realise that the supposed option was not available to us. I am sure that his hon. Friends will go through the painful process of explaining the matter to him. Perhaps we should adjourn the Committee for five minutes to allow them to do that. The length of the necessary adjourment would give us enough time to have dinner, never mind a cup of tea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr has raised an important point. He should reaffirm that if our procedures had allowed us to vote for an all-Ayrshire amendment, there is no question but that we should have voted for it. My hon. Friend has already given the assurance that Labour Members will vote for such an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I advise my hon. Friend that the name "Raquel" is to be heard regularly in "Only Fools and Horses". That may be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My daughter's name is Rachael. Even my hon. Friend, if he wishes to remain my friend, had better not make jokes at her expense. However, to assure my own safety, I must tell my hon. Friend that he is exactly right. Had the order of the amendments appeared as we intended, rather than as procedural circumstance dictated, Labour Members certainly would have pressed for a vote on all all-Ayrshire authority, for exactly the same reason as that put forward by the Minister in respect of North Lanarkshire. It is an interesting argument, to which we shall return on Report, when we shall press the case for the all-Ayrshire authority that we have favoured all along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial point is that we are not talking about fragmenting authorities. The size of North Lanarkshire would be reduced, but not hugely, to the average level that has been talked about, because Strathkelvin and Bearsden would become part of another, larger authority. That authority, on the edges of the city of Glasgow, would be a perfect component to balance the size of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee would be right to reflect on the inconsistencies in the argument that is being advanced. We would be wise also to reflect on another element of the Bill. We are not talking about abstracts, as in the Criminal Justice Bill. That involves legislative proposals which may or may not come into effect, which will be interpreted by judges through the years and which may or may not have practical consequences. We are dealing with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
definition of local authorities and we are doing so on a very tight timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outside the House, the Minister tells local authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities that they are obstructing the Government's plans for local government reorganisation in Scotland by not co-operating with them. Yet daily in this Committee, there is movement in the boundaries, criteria and the standards by which the Government judge the proposals. How can anyone predict what the Government will do tomorrow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be more reasonable to differentiate between the position taken by COSLA and that taken by individual authorities? COSLA deals in generalities. It has made no boundary recommendations to the Government, but has said that it is reasonable for individual authorities to put their cases to the Government. That is what we are discussing in the Committee: the individual cases that authorities have advanced during discussions at meeting after meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I do not object to the Government being reasonable. We are slightly surprised, because we are not used to that phenomenon. My point is that local authorities in Scotland, and the people who will run them, must be receiving hugely confused signals from what the Government are doing in the Committee. Yet next year they will have the first elections to the authorities, whose boundaries move and shift with every whim that enters the Minister's mind. If we followed a logical pattern from consultation to the consultation document, through the White Paper, on Second Reading and in the Committee, many people in Scotland would at least know what the Government were doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wholly unreasonable for the Government to say that local government reorganisation will, willy-nilly, come into practical effect next year, when they have no fixed guidelines, signposts or milestones along the road to getting there. It may well be that the Minister is being swayed by the flow of debate in the Committee. In his original statement, he implied that perhaps it was regrettable that the Opposition had not tabled more amendments. If a guillotine is imposed I wonder whether the Minister will be as generous in his view. The Minister said that the Government were willing to consider amendments. They have accepted some, yet they say that they would not have tabled any amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the objective bystander make of such a process? Had the hon. Member for Ayr not taken out his motor car atlas and decided to draw some lines on it, would Ayrshire still have two authorities rather than three? The Government were not proposing three authorities. If the hon. Member for Ayr had not run out of lead in his pencil, we might have had 10
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
authorities in Ayr because that might have appealed to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before the Liberal Democrats interrupted us—I welcomed the interruption because the results on the Floor of the House were decisive—I was about to return to the subject of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, which was the brunt of my speech, although all of what I say relates to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting point has arisen. Uncertainty exists in Scottish local government. Only 14 months before the shadow elections to the new authorities, there is complete uncertainty about what the boundaries will be. That must worry not only people in local government who will be expected to make the new authorities work if the Bill is enacted but the wider community whose services will be affected by the structures that will be adopted. Therefore, what the Minister has said about Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and the amendment has a significance reaching well beyond the case that I advanced on behalf of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he is minded to maintain the boundaries of the proposed north Lanarkshire council but that he will reflect on what has been said. In the circumstances it would be wrong to press to a vote amendments that would block other possibilities that are likely to be more popular among people in those areas. If the Minister will clarify that, I shall be minded not to press amendment No. 27, but on the basis that the communities in the relevant areas are allowed to put their views, with the Minister listening and being persuaded by the strength of argument for the new authority. That is not an unreasonable demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the hon. Member for Angus, East will do. Perhaps he was telephoning during the suspension of the sitting. We want to keep the matter open. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to have a vote, that would be worst of all possible options, and we would be obliged to vote against. However, the openness of mind that the Government have suddenly developed at this stage of their antiquity may lead them to reflect on the argument that is universally held throughout the areas of Strathkelvin and Cumbernauld district councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tain Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the important contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, I ask a few questions of the Minister because I am rather puzzled about the methods by which the boundaries are arrived at.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
Without anticipating clause 33, does the Minister agree that joint structure plans will have to be prepared for the Clyde valley and for Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen and their hinterlands? Will a Clyde valley structure plan be prepared in the new circumstances? The Bill does not specify any areas. The Secretary of State has stated consistently that unitary authorities for the main Scottish cities and their hinterlands are too small to carry out effective strategic planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is: does the Minister have any view about the minimum geographical area or the minimum size of population for which a structure plan should be prepared? That is relevant to decisions about boundaries. Does he believe that structure plans should be prepared for areas that coincide with the boundaries of, for example, passenger transport authorities, local enterprise company areas, or health boards? Why does not he specify in primary legislation those areas that require a joint structure plan for more than one authority? Why is such a provision not included at an early stage in the Bill? If we are to make decisions such as those that we have discussed for the past hour and a half, we should have a clear view about primary legislation and those areas that require a joint structure plan for more than one authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister ensure that the areas that require a joint structure plan are defined at the outset as shadow authorities to enable the proper transfer of resources and the establishment of operational procedures? Many people would like a prompt answer to those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that there were no easy answers, yet he has simply reaffirmed what people clearly said they do not want. I am perturbed by the way in which matters are proceeding. When will decisions be made—later in Committee, on Report or under a guillotine? We are drifting along and the Government have not made a decision. The Minister may claim that he wants to consult further, but, we should have some idea about the end product of that consultation. If we proceed, we shall discuss services without knowing the structure of the authorities. We are debating in a vacuum. Meaningful debate is difficult unless we know the framework in which services will operate. A sense of drift does the Committee no good. Does the Minister know when decisions will be made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Hamilton believes that the spectre of Gordon Murray looms over me, he should wait and see what it does to him. He is in more danger than me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[HON MEMBERS: "Oh!"] I mean from a spectre—metaphorically speaking. It is incorrect to imply that unanimity of view exists about the boundary changes. The hon. Member for Hamilton dismisses the opinion of many people who want Cumbernauld and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
Kilsyth to be their unitary authority. His threat works both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not apologise for tabling the amendment. I shall withdraw it reluctantly if we can investigate the Minister's intentions. I hope that the truth will be brought to light of day and that the Minister can give us some sort of timetable. I could then withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says that he would like to know when the process will end and when the Bill will be on the statute book. I should like to know the answer to that question. We have to consider the proceedings not only in this House but in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not inquiring when the Bill would be on the statute book; I was inquiring when the Minister would come to a decision about boundaries, which I presumed would be before the Bill got on to the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman's request is unreasonable. All I am saying is that it is not impossible, either on Report or in another place, for there to be considerable interest in some of the matters that we have been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow made a general point about structure plans. That is covered by clause 33, which deals with the Secretary of State's powers. No doubt he will look forward to the general discussion on clause 33.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that that will not do. How can boundaries be determined if there is no view on the minimum geographical area or minimum size of population for which a structure plan should be prepared? That reveals how ill thought out the Bill is. The Minister should ask for advice, because I wonder who on earth dreamt up these boundaries. The Wheatley commission consulted throughout the country. Who in heaven's name has dreamt up all these boundaries? We are entitled to know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The process is perfectly clear. After extensive consultations the Government put forward a set of proposals. We provided for the Secretary of State to have powers to designate the areas in respect of which planning authorities will be required to prepare structure plans and to provide for the carrying out of certain functions. That is clear from clause 33. The hon. Gentleman surely regards it as reasonable for the Committee to have a full debate and, if necessary, to make changes to the Government's proposals.

The hon. Members for Angus, East and for Hamilton referred to uncertainty. Some uncertainty is inevitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Parliament and hear their case. He is now keeping his options open on North Lanarkshire, and no doubt he will be willing to see my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and any deputations he may arrange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there will be further discussions on Report, will the Minister agree to meet any deputations from Ayrshire who wish to put the case for an all-Ayrshire authority, which the Minister earlier recognised had some merit? Will he keep that option open for the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must enter the caveat that the Committee came to a decision on Ayrshire in light of the clear recommendation made by me, which was supported by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he came to that decision "on balance". He is quoted as saying that, I put forward a very strong argument. There was no vote on an all-Ayrshire authority. All that happened was that the amendment which divided Ayrshire into three was carried, but no subsequent votes were allowed because of our procedure. In view of the balanced nature of the decision, and the fact that we were unable to vote on an all-Ayrshire authority and we are keeping options open in two other major parts of Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In three other parts of Scotland—East Lothian as well—I urge the Minister to agree to put this matter on the same basis, otherwise it will be felt that Ayrshire is being hard done by. If the Minister is going to make subsequent or consequent adjustments to other areas, he should also take Ayrshire into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly reluctant to make a commitment to meet every delegation about every matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be most unfair if, having acknowledged the merit of the three-way split in Ayrshire, my arguments and the representations of two of the other Members of Parliament representing Ayrshire constituencies, my hon. Friend the Minister went back on the logical and commendable decision that he took.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would slightly amend what my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr has said. The Committee took that decision, not me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a difference between my remarks on Central—I said that we would reflect on it, but had not come to a decision—and the recommendation on Ayrshire. As the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley knows, I try to be as open-minded as possible in responding to delegations led by hon. Members. If the hon. Gentleman believes that additional points should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
put to the Government, it is his right to approach the Scottish Office and put his points to a Minister. However, I should not want that to be misleading, as the Committee has come to a clear decision on Ayrshire.
