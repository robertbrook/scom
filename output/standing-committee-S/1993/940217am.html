</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee may share my feelings of relief that we have moved on from the issue of boundaries and gone on to other matters. Of course, we shall return to the consideration of boundaries later in our proceedings. I look forward to jousting with Conservative Members and, perhaps, even with some of my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the important issues of boundaries, my hon. Friend may have noted some good news from the parliamentary Boundary Commission. It inferred that the Minister was right to do away with the Berwickshire and East Lothian local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on the outcome of the work of parliamentary Boundary Commission. It only goes to show that when one has an independent commission, it produces genuine, non-partisan and non-gerrymandered boundary proposals. If we had had an independent commission for local government, it might have produced similar results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is, I hope, non-contentious. I see a bubble coming out of the Minister's head saying, "That's unusual for the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In various places in the Bill, the civic head of an authority is described as "chairman" and the deputy head as "vice-chairman". I understand that. I have no quarrel with the Bill's draftsmen because those terms are regularly used throughout the United Kingdom to describe the people who run local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later clauses in the Bill deal with the chairmen or chairwomen of the cities. It states that they shall be the "lord provost". Again, I have no quarrel with that. If the cities wish to call their chairmen "lord provost", I shall not object to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
The Bill also provides for any authority to designate the person who chairs the authority with a title that it chooses. It would be open to individual authorities, for example Ayrshire, to call the person who chairs the authority the "provost". Similarly, in other authorities, such as West Lothian, the person chairing the authority could also be called the "provost". I do not wish to challenge that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the generic term for the person chairing the authority. Throughout the Bill, the generic term is "chairman". The amendments suggest that the person chairing the authority should be called the "convener" and that his or her deputy should be either the "vice-convener" or, my preference, "depute convener".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why I move the amendment on behalf of all my hon. Friends—I hope that it will also find favour with hon. Members in other parties. First, "convener" is a non-sexist term. It does not imply that the person chairing the authority is either a man or a woman. The word "chairman" is always open to challenge. Suggestions are made that the person should be called the "chairperson" or that appalling title "chair". "Convener" cannot be shortened. It is not open to misinterpretation and it is non-sexist. That is the first argument in its favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument is that it is a Scottish term, one that is used regularly throughout Scotland for a person who is in charge of/chairs various bodies. The term "convener" is well recognised, understood and accepted. Perhaps the only challenge or dispute is whether its final vowel should be "e" or "o". I am impartial, agnostic and quite relaxed on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the word "convener" or "convenor"—I used "convener" in the amendment—should be adopted as the generic term. It would then be open to each local authority either to adhere to that term—as I hope most would—or, under a subsequent provision, to change the term to "provost" or whatever. I hope that this reasonable, modest and sensible suggestion finds favour with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), but a change in the words is not that appropriate. We are speaking of local authorities which, in the end, must be run very much along business lines. In many instances, we are talking of big money authorities. The term "chairman" can be recognised and acknowledged in big business. It is a long-standing description. There are chairmen of Ayrshire Enterprise—a group about which the hon. Gentleman has much commented recently—of health boards and of large companies. Such bodies have not used the term "convener"; the term is not recognised as part of the overall business scene. Therefore, there is justification in at least questioning the hon. Gentleman's perhaps well put arguments for a change to the term "convener".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "convener" has other connotations. It is a traditional term in trade unions; the word establishes specific relationships within the trade union organisations. Given the hon. Gentleman's background, I recognise the affection that he may have for the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the comments on the future use of the word "provost". It is a really Scottish word; its use has been established over a long time in local authorities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
throughout Scotland. I am sure that the new authority of South Ayrshire would wrap up the term "provost" in its wording although, of course, it would be open to the new North Ayrshire authority to use the word "convener", which has been built in to the Cunninghame district tradition in recent years. In such respects the words "convener" and "provost" are well worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Martin, are addressed as "Chairman" in this Committee. The term "chairman" fully recognises the authority and respect that the person who controls the affairs of a local authority or of a committee should command. I commend the word "chairman" to my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from his comments about you, Mr. Martin, I thoroughly disagree with the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) about the use of the word "chairman". We are not discussing this Committee; we are discussing Scottish local government. The word "chairman" could apply to a golf or tennis club, or anything. The term has a certain greyness. Use-of the word "chairperson" or even the more linguistically barren term "chair" would be inappropriate for Scottish local government. The word "convener", which has been used in connection with regional councils, is a perfectly respectable word which has a long, historic connection with Scottish local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not expect the amendment to be opposed, but I reckoned without the hon. Member for Ayr. The Church and Nation committee of the Church of Scotland has a convener, as has the business committee of the general council of the university of Edinburgh. Many Scottish organisations have the title "convener" for their chairperson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that "convener" is an historic Scottish title with which people can identify. I go further than the hon. Gentleman in hoping that the word "provost" will be adopted by the councils simply because that, too, is a term with which people can identify. I do not want the term to be consigned to a museum or end up as a folk memory in the title of a book by John Gait. I want the words "provost" and "convener" to continue as a living part of Scottish local government. They go back into Scottish history and will link the new councils with their predecessors and more than 900 years of history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new local councils must decide in this matter, but I hope that they will use the titles "convener" and "provost" and so maintain the connection with the history of Scottish local Government. The terms mean something to the Scottish public and I commend them to the new authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) has made a sound argument. I understand the historic implications of the word "convener" and have no objection to it one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments seem to have persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, even before I have made my recommendation to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
Committee. This has been an interesting, even, one might say, fascinating, debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm the important point made by the hon. Members for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and for Angus, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. Nothing in the amendment or in the Bill will prevent a council from using the term "provost" if it wishes. Many councils use "convener".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The freedom for an authority to choose a title for its chairman derives from section 3(6) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 as amended by the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1981. That is continued by clause 4 of the Bill. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is right about the use of the term "Lord Provost" for the four cities and the amendments would not affect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accepting the amendments would involve some consequential changes to the 1973 Act, but there is no difficultly with that. However, the one difficulty about accepting all the amendments is that amendments Nos. 143 and 145 are incompatible—one or the other must be chosen. It might be best if the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley were to withdraw the amendment on the absolute assurance that we should introduce an amendment to make the word "convener" the genetic term throughout the Bill. If hon. Members decide to press the amendments to votes, we shall not resist them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the case made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr is at least neutral on the matter. It would be helpful if he would show a preference for either "vice-convener" or "depute convener". I am prepared to accept whichever one is preferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My preference is for "depute convener". May I draw the Minister's attention to a point that I made in a previous debate? I prefer the terms "convener" and "depute convener". We have already referred to the fact that cities will be designated as cities, but would not it help if those authorities that will not be cities could be designated as counties? There would then be county conveners, as has always been the case. At present, such authorities will be described as councils. It would be useful if they could be specifically designated as counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may return to that point. Some of the new authorities have historic associations with counties, others do not. There is a difficulty in accepting the general proposition. There might be differences among hon. Members about whether to accept "depute convener" or "vice convener". I am happy to accept hon. Members' preference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made a positive start to the sitting. The Minister has been extremely helpful and even the hon. Member for Ayr saw the light in the end. I have had a brief discussion with my hon. Friends and the preference is for "depute convener", as it is more typical. I shall not say anything about vice and its appropriateness or otherwise to local or to central government. The

	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Conservative Members are coming to the view that the only safe, non-sexist term is "chair"? There is a long-standing tradition of using it in the Labour party. Why are not Labour Members insisting on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to answer that. I may be an old fashioned, reactionary codger, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind my hon. Friend of what a former Member of Parliament for Glasgow, Rutherglen, the late Gregor MacKenzie, stated? He said that the term "chair" was not so much feminism, but furniturism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely right. The last thing that I would want to tangle with is a piece of furniture. Perhaps I should have said second last—I can see wicked smiles on the faces of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave a helpful assurance and I recognise that some consequential amendments will be tabled by the Government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 2, line 28, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) The islands councils of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles shall continue to exist as bodies corporate but, on and after 1st April 1996—
	<ol>
	<li>they shall be known as 'Orkney Islands Council', 'Shetland Islands Council' and 'Western Isles Council'; and</li>
	<li>their areas shall be known as 'Orkney Islands', 'Shetland Islands' and 'Western Isles',</li></ol>
respectively.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) The islands councils consisting of the councillors elected for the islands areas of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles at the ordinary election held in 1994 shall continue as councils until the second ordinary election of councillors for the new councils held under section 5 of this Act.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace). There is potential for a degree of confusion about the way that the two sets of local authorities are set up in clauses 2 and 3. There could be legal argument about whether the islands councils—Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles—are properly constituted under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way around that problem would be the combination of clauses 2 and 3. It would have been more appropriate to have drawn the new area's constituted councils in one clause. Definitions elsewhere in the Bill, such as in clause 15(7), could produce doubt about whether the provisions in other parts of the Bill refer directly to the clause 3 authorities—Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid doubt, it would be sensible for the Committee to consider the prospect of constituting councils in one clause so that there can be no ambiguity about which councils are being referred to in the rest of the Bill. If they were all in one clause, references to clause 2 would remove
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
any doubt about which new council areas were being constituted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand perfectly that there are some differences. On the mainland, councils are being abolished and new authorities put in their place, whereas the three islands councils are being carried over and given new corporate identities. They will not, under special provisions, require elections, shadow authorities and transitional proceedings. However, lawyers—the big silk hankie brigade—could in future make many a penny by holding money extracted from local authorities—and, indeed, Governments—arguing about an ambiguity that may continue if we do not address this point now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to have the Minister's assurance that his legal eagles have pored over the matter and are absolutely confident that clauses 2 and 3, as they stand, will not give rise to this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for raising this issue. We are aware of the background to the concerns that have prompted the amendment. As the hon. Gentleman said, the background is complex but, in essence, doubts have been expressed about whether the Bill adequately safeguards the legal constitution of the islands councils on and after 1 April 1996. The hon. Gentleman made the point that the islands councils are in a different clause because they will be continuing, whereas the mainland councils are being reconstituted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that those whom he described as our legal eagles have looked very carefully at the relevant clauses in the light of representations that we have received and in the light of the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland. I also assure him that, in the Government's view, clauses 1 to 3 fully cover the legal constitution of the islands councils after 1 April 1996, and that the potential problem which he raised will not in practice arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that under clause 1, Scotland is divided into the local government areas named in schedule 1. That includes the islands areas. Clause 2(1) effects the constitution of councils and does so in respect of every local government area. Accordingly, that includes the three islands areas. The conclusion that all councils, including islands councils, are constituted by clause 2 is supported by the numerous references throughout the Bill in the definitions of "new authority", for example in clause 8(5), which refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"any of the authorities constituted under section 2 of this Act (other than Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands or Western Isles)".</p></blockquote>
It is the Government's view, therefore, that the islands councils will be properly constituted for the purposes of the Bill, the 1973 Act and all other relevant legislation once the new structure comes into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this is a technical matter. That is not to say that it is not important. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for having raised it, and for giving me the opportunity to put these assurances on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well satisfied with the Minister's reply. I take it that the islands authorities will be able to look to the Government to sort out any problems that arise in future. I am willing to accept the Minister's assurance. I am not technically qualified to contradict
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
what he has said. It is useful to have his remarks on the record, because that will give the islands councils some comfort. I am sure that they can look to him for the assistance that is implicit in his assurance in the remote eventuality that a problem arises at some distant date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arising out of subsection (2), which makes provision for the functions that are to be assigned to the new councils, could I ask 10 questions on property?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question one: what criteria will the Secretary of State use to determine which properties will transfer to the residuary bodies? Question two: will capital receipts from the disposal of surplus property by the residuary bodies be passed in full to the relevant authority? Question three: how will the residuary body dispose of surplus property?

Question five: what executive powers will be granted to the property commission? Question six: what criteria will the Secretary of State use to determine which water and drainage properties will be transferred to the new water board? In the notes provided by the Scottish Office specific reference is made at this point to water and drainage.

Question seven: what arrangements will be made in respect of properties which are currently jointly used by water and drainage and other regional departments? Question eight: will the existing rights of tenants in tied and water drainage houses be protected? Question nine: will property transfer to the new authorities entirely on the basis of location, except out-of-area properties? If so, what funding provision will be made for the replacement of facilities lost as a result of boundaries? Question 10: will the Secretary of State provide adequate funding to allow decentralisation proposals to be implemented?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no bones about the fact that I have discussed those questions at some length with the local government reorganisation steering group of Lothian region. We are extremely interested to learn what the answers might be at a fairly early stage in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make two other points. As I understand it, the Bill goes fairly wide on functions. First, I should like the Minister's comment on correspondence between the Prime Minister and the right hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
Tonbridge and Mailing (Sir J. Stanley). I have been deeply involved with the right hon. Gentleman over the Ponting trial and much else. He has issued a press statement. He is a serious man and a former Housing Minister. I shall not read out the press statement to the Committee, Mr. Martin, knowing your concern about things being read out but it raises the most acute concerns about unitary authorities in Kent. What is important for our purposes is the Prime Minister's reply. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can assure you that the maintenance of the status quo is an option that the Local Government Commission can consider in carrying out its review of local government structure in the shire counties. Ministers have made it clear on a number of occasions that the status quo is one of the options and will continue to do so on appropriate occasions."</p></blockquote>
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forgive me if I have misunderstood, but the Prime Minister raises a new issue in that statement. If that is relevant to England, why is it not relevant to the future of Strathclyde and Lothian? The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise, therefore, that in some areas the Commission may wish to recommend a continuation of the existing two-tier structure."</p></blockquote>
That rather alters the basis of the matter. Earlier in the week I had the opportunity to talk to Sir Frank Layfield, who has considered the matter in depth. A serious body of opinion holds that the two-tier structure is still an option.
I have the permission of the right hon. Member for Shropshire, North (Mr. Biffen) to refer to a letter that he wrote to the Local Government Commission for England. The right hon. Gentleman, a former Leader of the House, writes, first:
	<br><blockquote><p>"my reasons for 'no change' are:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>1. I discern no public demand for change in Shropshire local government."</p></blockquote>
We could echo that comment, could we not? My original question, put in the Committee's first sitting, about where the demand comes from, has not been answered. My answer, that it comes from saloon bar gossip, is as good as any. Secondly, the right hon. Member for Shropshire, North writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The impact of the growth of grant maintained schooling cannot yet be assessed, but ultimately it could be crucial to the future responsibilities and financing of local government."</p></blockquote>
Until that has been achieved, what on earth is the reason—even using the criteria of the Government, who want local government change—for tinkering with sophisticated and developed organisations such as Lothian or Strathclyde education departments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The establishment of unitary councils will involve the costs that have always accompanied local government reform."</p></blockquote>
Anyone I have spoken to in this building about the matter has sighed and told me, "Local government reform always costs more than anybody ever imagines."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the two letters because I consider them highly relevant to early in our proceedings. I leave it at that, but I should like the Minister, at his convenience, to deal with my 10 questions. I believe that they are in order on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on aspects of the clause. I accept that the hon. Gentleman's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
points were in order, because if they had not been, you, Mr. Martin, would have said so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall sum up the stage that we have reached. We have agreed that the term "convener" should replace "chairman". The main argument for that is that future statutes should more closely reflect every-day terminology in local authorities. We have also considered the application of the clause to the islands areas. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire for accepting my assurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause sets out the basic provision that every local government area will have a council consisting of a chairman—now to be a convener—and councillors. It also provides for the functions that are to be assigned to the new councils. Those are essentially the functions carried out by existing regional, islands and district councils. The provision is, however, subject to other provisions in the Bill, which we will consider later—notably in relation to water and sewerage services and to the Scottish Children's reporter administration, both of which are currently functions of existing local authorities, and for which special provision is of course made in parts II and III respectively. Those issues will be the subject of considerable debate in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the clause provides for the councils to be bodies corporate—as are existing councils. The names of the authorities will be determined by clause 1 in conjunction with schedule 1, in which all the authorities are defined and named.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essentially a technical clause. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) perfectly properly used the opportunity to raise two issues. He referred to the correspondence between my hon. Friends representing English constituencies and the Prime Minister. That issue was raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) in an earlier sitting, so I shall confirm the position again. Ministers responsible for reform in England have consistently said that they do not rule out completely the possibility of a two-tier system continuing in some parts of England. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales has consistently said that he was in favour of a complete move to a unitary system in Wales. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has consistently said that the Government's purpose in Scotland was to move to a unitary system. There is no change in policy on either side of the border as a result of the correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be some problems or hiccups in England as the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Supposing the hiccups in England escalated and there was a serious possibility of the English Bill not going ahead, would the Minister then tell the Committee that he would press ahead before the election with local government reorganisation in Scotland only? If the proposals for England were derailed, it would be unwise to reorganise local government in Scotland only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is looking at me with his customary
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
kindly smile—I hope he does not take that comment amiss—but I do not think that he expects me to respond positively to that suggestion. I do not believe for a moment that the legislation south of the border will be derailed. I have every confidence that my right hon. and hon. Friends will move to a sensible system for the people of England in the same way as we are moving towards a sensible system for the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the detailed questions raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, we shall discuss property on clauses 15 to 19. I will consider the hon. Gentleman's questions carefully when I read them in 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow. I understand his wish to receive answers before we reach the clauses that concentrate on property, so I will be happy to write to him before we do so. However, I make the general point that the property clauses are deliberately drafted flexibly to allow us to establish appropriate arrangements for local government in discussions with it. I hope that we can start those discussions, which are obviously important, as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my remarks have been helpful. I commend clause 2 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the clause is generally acceptable, so I shall just record briefly what it does. It makes special provision for the existing islands councils for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles to continue as legal entities on and after 1 April 1996. We have earlier had a useful exchange of views on that in relation to the amendment to clause 2 moved by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. The position is different from that on the mainland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special arrangements for the islands are intended to avoid unnecessary disruption and expense in circumstances where there will in effect be little change in the operation of the new authorities. There will also be no need to have councils elected in shadow form in the islands areas, so they are excluded from the requirement to have elections to shadow authorities on 6 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three authorities will in future be known as councils with the names of the new council areas being Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands and Western Isles. For practical purposes, that means that the names of the councils in Orkney and Shetland will remain unchanged. In the Western Isles, however, the council will in future be known as the Western Isles Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the clause are a sensible acknowledgement of the fact that as they already have single-tier authorities there are strong arguments for ensuring that the islands areas have as much continuity and as little disruption and expense as possible. I do not think that there is disagreement on that. Therefore, I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(9) A council may from amongst its members elect a leader and depute leader.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(10) A council may pay the leader and depute leader, for the purpose of enabling each of them to meet the expenses of their office, such allowance as the council thinks reasonable.".</p></blockquote>
I thank the members of the Committee for their tolerance and patience on Tuesday. Having read the 	<i>Hansard</i> record I realise that while I made a difficult and lengthy case, it was more lengthy than I intended. I hope, this time, to speak briefly. The subject should be aired and I hope that the Minister will take it seriously. However, it will not require much debate in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow a council to elect from among its members a leader and a depute leader. The reality of local government in Scotland is that, after years of district and regional councils operating, it is, I believe, very much like it was in England for many years. The political leader—the leader of the majority group of party politicians in the council—has a special place and responsibility which is different from that of, what we hope will be, the convener and depute convener. That is part of modern democracy and is to be welcomed. There is a necessity to guide the politics and the policies of the council separately from the civic role of the person who chairs the council and represents the council in civic contacts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for the convener to be balanced in chairing, in the same way as you, Mr. Martin and your co-Chairman, Sir James, act in this Committee. It is wrong to put together the civic role and the role of the political driving force, the person delivering the manifesto and the promises that were made to the public in a political context. There can be great difficulty. Some of the dignity can be taken away from the role of the convener and depute convener as they try to be the balancing force in the chamber and public representatives. The leader and deputy leader of a council over the last decade or more are seen increasingly to be standing up and speaking for the policies that the majority of the council were elected on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look around the Opposition Benches I see many people who were not leaders of councils. Under the proposed subsection (10) the council may pay the leader and deputy leader a sum of money. It is unfortunate that
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
ad hoc arrangements often have to be made at present to give an extra payment to the leader and deputy leader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central about this. I was 32 when I became a leader of a council and he was 33. That is in the middle of one's earning life. I had to change my work pattern: I worked in my salaried position only three days a week and I was in the council two days a week to cope with the responsibilities of being leader. The authority was only a district. It did not have the large responsibilities of the unitary authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) was on the fast track in these matters and he was in his twenties. He is one of the younger hon. Members at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who become leaders make a large commitment. That should be commended. The dignity of the civic offices should be safeguarded and it should be clearly identified that there are people in the council who take on the role of leader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke recently to the person who has taken over as leader of Stirling. There are 10 Labour members and 10 Conservatives and on the cut of the cards the Conservatives now run the council. The leader is a small shopkeeper. He finds that the burden of being leader interferes tremedously with his ability to run his small business. In a sense he has only an ad hoc recognition which was won by the operation of the Labour leadership in the period 1980–92. There is no statutory position and we believe that it should be written into the Act. It says quite clearly that they may have a leader or a deputy leader; it does not say they must have one. It is not compulsory. We think that it would be a good step forward. I hope that the Government will accept our proposal and allow us to put the reality of the Bill in line with the reality of how local government is run at the moment. It is worth recognising and I will get a complimentary response for the Government and the Committee if we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke on an earlier amendment to raise an issue and simply have it debated. On this amendment, however, I feel strongly that it should not be accepted. It is a sad reflection on Scotland these days that party politics has made a major contribution to the local authority structure. In some parts of Scotland, particulary in the north and down in the south in Galloway, there are councils with an independence of mind as far as the elected representatives go. But there is far too much political influence right across Scotland in the exisitng councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not think it strange that he, who earns an annual salary in excess of £30,000 and gets additional significant sums from Scottish Power to represent its interests here, should tell local councillors that they cannot be paid enough to do the business that they are elected to do in their areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to avoid personal involvement on the salary side. As the hon. Gentleman introduces that aspect, I have to tell him that many councillors also find themselves in exactly the same position. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) suggested that he had a part-time external employment role. In my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
experience most of the leaders of councils had a full-time fully salaried role that went in line with a voluntary role that they took on within their political grouping on a council. The hon. Gentleman speaks about the appointment of the leader of the majority group within a council, but the burdens on leaders of the opposition group can at times be just as onerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I finish my point I shall give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The roles are voluntary and people become involved by choice and because of their commitment to local interests. Council involvement in Scotland has lost that recently. I found it difficult to carry out the role of a councillor because of my job, and that was a major contributor to my giving up my council post. However, I made the choice. Before doing so, I lived up to my commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman knows that in some councils where ad hoc arrangements have been made for leaders, similar arrangements are made for the leaders of the minority groups? Services, equipment and staff may have been supplied for them. Arrangements are made because there has to be an ad hoc response, but something of a more statutory nature has been requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that he has argued the best case? As a councillor—not a chair or leader of a group—he found it difficult to cope with work and the duties of a councillor. Cannot he understand that that argues strongly that the person who takes on the leadership of a council has not just volunteered, but taken on a substantial commitment? That should be recognised. The hon. Gentleman has argued the best case for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My difficulties with the council arose principally through the evolution of daytime council meetings. I did not have problems with my group because it met outside normal council working hours. That carried what was a hobby and a commitment to the community into time outside council working hours. That aspect was nothing other than interesting, demanding and full of commitment. My duties could be carried out usefully and in conjunction with my colleagues. I do not accept that, politically, there is necessarily a burden. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider my comments. I am not likely to change my mind about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an example of the dual standards that tend to bring the House into disrepute. I strongly support the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East and gently remind the hon. Member for Ayr and the Minister that, frequently, chairmen of the Conservative party and Members of Parliament have been put into public positions or Government positions or sinecures. When Chris Patten was chairman of the Conservative party, he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Such things happen all the time in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is right for the Government to create paid party political posts, it must be equally right that there should be proper recognition of the work and commitment of leaders of controlling groups on local authorities, who hold highly responsible jobs. People should be able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
devote an appropriate time to them without their livelihoods suffering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the conclusion of the hon. Member for Ayr, who is reminiscing about a bygone age. The rural councils, which he described accurately, will be swept aside by the Government's changes. He should address the reality for the bulk of councils in Scotland. My point is brief and simple: the labourers are worthy of their hire. There will be fewer councils and fewer councillors under the Government's system. Therefore, there will be more duties placed on councils and councillors, and on the civic heads of councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there would be nothing wrong with any group within an authority—particularly the ruling group—appointing a leader from the conveners of the various committees, which post can attract additional remuneration? Would not that deal with the points that have been raised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would, but we must accept the fact that under the new council system those who take on the duty of civic leader will have a far greater work-load in terms of time, resources and expense. Those people will play a crucial role in relation to a community's identification with the new councils. If people are to identify with the councils, a tremendous extra burden will be placed on those civic heads. In the larger councils that will be created, that post will be more or less a full-time job. Suitable payment of expenses and prevention of personal financial loss would extend the range of those who can offer themselves as civic leaders in the new authorities and would allow them to perform the civic duties placed on them. Such payments would be fully reported to the public; they would be accountable to the public and would be transparent. My argument is that the labourers are worthy of their hire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new system is to work, if there is to be identification and if someone is to take on civic duties and be the civic leader, we should recognise the expense incurred in resources, time and finance—the burden—which such a person takes on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to say whether this amendment is required at all. In other words, do not local authorities already have discretion within their competence to make small allowances in circumstances which they deem to be necessary in the pursuance and discharge of their duties in general terms under the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that extent, the amendment may be redundant, although I do not oppose its basis. Indeed, I take the matter slightly further. Although it may not be so under the strict wording of the amendment, it should be competent for the authorities to set aside small sums of money to enable opposition councillors properly to carry out their task of scrutinising the authority's work, whoever is in control. That perhaps takes the matter a little further. Will the Minister consider that point when he replies? If it is technically possible, subject to audit and to transparency, I should certainly want to encourage councils at least to consider that. It would be a matter for them; we should give them the discretion to do as they wish. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that point. I hope that he will at least accept the spirit if not the terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was glad that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East paid tribute to councillors in general and to Councillor Keith Harding, the leader of Stirling district council, who, as my hon.

Has the Minister read the editorial in the 	<i>Stirling Observer</i> in which the editor said:

That is not relevant, however to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked whether the amendment was, strictly speaking, necessary. The hon. Gentleman was right: it is not necessary to achieve the objectives referred to by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. Councils have and will continue to have discretionary power for the appointment of their leader or deputy leader. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, leaders and deputy leaders are already appointed by the various political groups on a council without the need for that to be enshrined in statute. The appointment is not necessarily limited to the leader of the majority party. A number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
councils appoint leaders of all political groups. Therefore, the amendment is not strictly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the point about the effect of these provisions on allowances. As members of the Committee will be aware, authorities must make provision in their scheme of allowances for the payment of special responsibility allowances for those members who have significant responsibilities, such as committee chairmen. Eligibility for special responsibility allowance would also extend to the leader of the council. It is up to the council to identify the special responsibilities for which the allowances are to be paid, and the amounts of allowances to be paid for each such responsibility. Those amounts are in addition to any attendance allowance which may be included in a local authority scheme. Furthermore, when one political group is in control, the authority must make provision for the payment of special responsibility allowance to at least one member of the minority political group.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to attendance allowance. Do we take it that the Government propose to continue with the system of attendance allowance and that they will not make changes to it or introduce other schemes as various suggestions have been made in that respect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was first a councillor there was no attendance allowance. When it was introduced, with the reorganisation of local government in 1975, the figure stood at £10. That would now be worth about £50. Yet the allowance is relatively small. Could the Minister deal with that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, attendance allowances may be included in a local authority scheme. Therefore, the local authority has discretion, and we envisage that discretion continuing in the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, under the existing regulations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not have expressed myself very well. There have been suggestions that all councillors, not just those with positions of responsibility, might be remunerated in a different way, and not through the current attendance allowance. Have the Government not taken that on board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are reviewing the existing regulations, as I have just mentioned, but we do not envisage removing the discretion that councils now have for attendance allowance schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

are certainly intent on the completion of the review this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. I hope that the review will be completed with all dispatch. Will the Minister confirm that during the review he will carefully examine the question of travel expenses? Evidence now suggests that in rural areas expenses do not begin to cover the full cost of travel. The Minister will know that there is much comment about the fact that the travel expenses available to Members of Parliament are far in excess of those available to councillors, who do much travelling—particularly in rural areas—by car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I have received representations similar to those that he has received, particularly from councillors in rural areas such as his constituency. I confirm that the review includes scrutiny of travel allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within current upper limits, authorities are otherwise free to decide on the payments made to individuals within the prescribed limits for minimum and maximum levels of total expenditure on such allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. It would create problems in the allowance system, which has a certain flexibility at present. The likely consequence of the amendment would be a squeeze on the resources available to minority groups in a given system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would agree that the remuneration of councillors, their expenses and the like, is an important issue, and that it is perhaps inappropriate to have the matter dealt with while we are looking at what I understood to be simply an expenses allowance to conveners, as they are now to be, and vice-conveners. Would not the Minister agree that it is perhaps more appropriate that we have our debate at a later stage in the Bill, on a new clause about payments for councillors as that would allow the issues to be explored properly, rather than in this way, which, I think, does not do justice to the sterling work done by elected members of local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I pay tribute to the sterling work done by councillors of all political parties—and of none, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr pointed out. It is an important subject, and if hon. Members wish to table amendments or new clauses allowing for a wider debate, I shall be happy to respond. I was simply responding to the points made in relation to the proposals of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. The debate has in part been used—legitimately—to flag up points that may be considered at greater length later in the proceedings. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East may be inclined to withdraw the amendment. If he is not so minded, I shall have to advise my hon. Friends to resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of councillors of all parties—and probably also on behalf of those of no party—I express serious disappointment with the Minister's reply. It has not recognised at all the reality of the way in which councils are run. It has misrepresented the facts without knowing it. The reality is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has not misrepresented the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I have to say that the Minister has possibly misinterpreted the facts. The facts are that there is a fixed allowance based on the size of the authority. When there is not a specific allowance for the leader of the council, which is not recognised as a position of responsibility in the same way as chair, and vice-chair, the fixed sum has to be divided and some ad-hoc arrangements have to be added for the leader of the council, the deputy leader and, often, for minority leaders. That is what happens in councils. It reduces the sums available for the chairs and vice-chairs of committees, who carry out what one might call statutory responsibilities. That is what happens every single day and every single year in local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we did not go far enough and were not sensitive enough to have included the leaders of minority parties on a council. Will the Minister take on board the reality of the situation and recognise that many people in councils are not back benchers or chairs of committees because they are not in the majority group and accept that they should be represented in the amendment? Will the Minister make a genuine offer to go away and consider what happens in councils so that he can return with an amendment on Report to give additional money for specific political leaders? They are the people who form policy. It includes those in the majority and opposition groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I said that after an election most councillors get together as councillors, forgetting about which political party they are in, except when it comes to the political theatre of the council meeting. They do the business behind doors in a balanced, objective and supportive way. They work party to party. It must be recognised that political leaders put in a great deal of extra effort to the process of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating unitary authorities with the responsibility for all local authority services. That is a massive task of policy balance. I hope that the Minister will tell us that he is prepared to go in the direction of exploring the possibility of additional statutory allowances to recognise the role of the leaders of political parties in councils and the leaders of the largest groups. Councillors often get together as independent groups. They do not just float around the council as individuals; they group together. If the Minister tells us that he is thinking in that way, we can probably withdraw the amendment with good grace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the hon. Gentleman's general point. The number of times that hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have referred to all-party representations has been a feature of our proceedings. In large measure, the amendments that have been made to the Bill reflect the representations from councils that the Government and hon. Members have received. Councillors have acted on an all-party basis in precisely the way that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East has described. I do not dissent from what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that we are reviewing the system of allowances. Clearly, that review is taking place against the background of the move to unitary authorities and the new responsibilities that councillors will, therefore, have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful discussion about the role of council leaders. The principal purpose of the clause is to re-enact much of sections 3 and 3(a) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 in relation to the offices of chairmen and vice-chairmen, or, to use the new titles which have been agreed, conveners and depute conveners, of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with the general thrust of the review of internal management, the Government propose that councils should have greater flexibility to determine the duration of the term of office of the chairmen and vice-chairmen, now to be conveners and deputy conveners. The clause allows councils to decide to incorporate in their standing orders the terms of office of chairmen and of vice-chairmen and the procedure for their early removal from office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause contains sensible relaxations to the conditions of the 1973 Act and leaves the new councils to make internal decisions about such matters. That is widely accepted in local government in Scotland. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>New clause 1—	<i>Proportional representation</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"—(1) Councillors for each local government area shall be elected by a system of proportional representation.
	<ol>
	<li>The Secretary of State shall make regulations by statutory instrument for a system of proportional representation, subject to the affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment anticipates the election of the new councils. I do not expect members of the Committee to agree about proportional representation because of set party-political stances, but an opportunity exists to develop a new system for the new councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key element is that councillors—there will be fewer because of the Government's plan—should be representative of the electorate. The first-past-the-post system does not always achieve that. Governments have been elected with 44 per cent. of the vote, which is equivalent to 33 per cent. of the electorate, and achieved massive majorities in the House. The winner takes all. That can mean that a party can gain massive support throughout the United Kingdom or in a council area, but win few seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system produces and suits the two major parties and its iniquity acts against the third and fourth parties. That is now a problem in Scotland for the Conservative party, which, is the third or the fourth party in many areas. Only mass electoral support can break through the inevitability of first past the post, which makes things impossible for the Conservatives. There is a great suspicion that the rules and the boundaries are being changed to overcome the handicap of the Conservatives coming third or fourth and to allow them to fiddle their way round the first-past-the-post system, which they support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proportional representation system would more truly reflect the wishes of the electorate, which should be the primary aim in a democracy. Elected councils should reflect their communities. The amendment deals with the principle of proportional representation, but does not advocate any single system. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I would be happy to state at length the details of the system preferred by my party, should the hon. Member for Hamilton wish it. However, that would be the next stage if the Committee accepted proportional representation. From past practice, I gravely doubt that that principle will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow the opportunity for each party to state its views about proportional representation as a principle of elected Government. I look forward to hearing the views of the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proportional representation is the generally accepted system throughout Europe and operates in a part of the United Kingdom; it is the norm for the rest of Europe. Its eventual acceptance in this country is probably inevitable as Europe moves to greater electoral harmonisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system of local government could present an opportunity for a new system of election through proportional representation which more truly reflects the electorate's views. Amendment No. 11 would provide for four-year elections. There are practical reasons, based on experience, in favour of that idea. Originally, I was against a four-year system, but support it now because it works better than its predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
Annual local elections were a disaster. They led to poor turnouts, public apathy and a degree of political war-weariness that I would not like to be reintroduced to the Scottish system. I want our local government system to be as dynamic and reflective of its communities as possible. I have doubts about the Government's system because it cannot achieve that. I want local government to be a dynamic part of daily life to which our citizens can contribute. Democracy is an important part of our national life and local government is an essential part of acting in that democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annual elections worked against those principles. Voluntary political parties could not keep up with the finances and resources required or cope with the grind of the work-load on its volunteer work force brought about by such elections. Our party system would buckle under the strain of constant electioneering—that applies to all parties. The loss of quality in representation would not be good for anyone. I reject annual elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in favour of a three-year cycle because it is not enough for proper long-term planning in local government. I support a four-year cycle, having seen it in practice. A three-year cycle is insufficient because it is a fact that the gravitational pull of elections determines how a system works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Budgets and plans in the year after an election are predetermined by the previous Administration. Predetermination is particularly acute when a new Administration takes over; no matter what it wants to do, it is locked into the previous year's budget and planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only during an Administration's second year that it can produce a budget and plans that reflect its and, therefore, the electors' views rather than the views of its predecessor. In a three-year cycle, the third year would clearly fall in an election year. The gravitational pull of the election would affect planning and budgeting, leaving only one year with the stability to think clearly and coolly ahead without always having electoral consequences in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three years is too short a cycle for anything other than short-term planning, and the problem of expediency is constantly hovering over it. In a four-year cycle, that is mitigated by a two-year election-free period in which longer term planning and budgeting are, by and large, made possible. I have seen that in operation, and I believe that a three-year cycle is too short, especially when larger councils will be run with fewer councillors, as the Bill proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for positive, systemic planning and budgeting reasons that I hope the Government will extend the election cycle to four years from three. The new local government system will have troubles enough without adding short-term electoral planning considerations permanently to its agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the support given to the four-year cycle by councils. As they know the problems involved and understand the system, they realise why that cycle would be more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept this amendment as a sensible, systemic proposal that will help the new system. Introducing a shorter cycle will, I believe, hinder the system in the long term. I hope that the Government will look favourably on this practical and sound proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments of the hon. Member for Angus, East. He deployed the case effectively on both counts. The four-year cycle is a more sensible rotation, although other variations could be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>My preference is for two-yearly elections for sections of the council, who would then serve for four years. Such a system would give the electorate continuous access and accountability and allow a degree of stability to many councillors.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman made a powerful case for the need for a four-year term. I hope that the Government will consider his suggestion seriously. I cannot imagine why they decided on three years. Perhaps the Minister can give us a convincing explanation in his reply. For my money, a three-year period is a strange, hybrid idea.</p>
	<p>On proportional representation, the Committee should seriously consider the systems of election for the new councils. One of the principal criticisms that has been made throughout our proceedings is that not enough thought has been given to putting together a coherent system that would include financial and election aspects as well as maps and functions. The Government should have allowed their proposals a longer gestation before making them public, and we should have had a proper public debate about systems of elections. I accept that there are advantages and disadvantages to all systems; there are disadvantages to some proportional representation systems. As far as I am concerned, however, the important factor is that proportional representation would enable the electors to scrutinise and effectively restrict profligate or potentially profligate councils, for example.</p>
	<p>Proportional representation would encourage people to take a much more active part in local democracy. The first-past-the-post system entrenches party political groups in certain areas in a way that makes the electorate sceptical about their ability to change some of the decisions that councils have made. Under that system, parties of whichever colour or stripe have been entrenched for many years.</p>
	<p>I was interested to read sections of the Plant committee report. I know that the Labour party's position is now clear on that, but I am disappointed that it did not move a bit faster and a bit further.</p>

Friends, such as the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). The Labour party would be well advised to be more positive about proportional representation because that would enhance its appeal to the electorate, but that is for it to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian I am a long-time supporter of proportional representation, but I have reservations about the amendment. What would be the effect of a list system on the election of independent councillors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
It seems to me that it would be almost impossible for independent councillors to get elected under a list system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that right on the chin. There are problems with the list system, but, as I said a few moments ago, there are disadvantages and advantages. It is as important to get the system right as it is to get the principle accepted. The interim report of the Plant committee was a genuinely interesting document from which I learnt much to my advantage on proportional representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point and I do not believe that the Government will suddenly accept proportional representation at this stage in the proceedings. However, I regret that they did not have the courage to stimulate a public debate on this important subject, which will not go away. The issue has been raised during my political lifetime—I am a lot older than I look, which may be not unconnected with the Committee's workload. This is a topic for live political discussion and I regret that the Government did not take the opportunity to stimulate such discussions. Even if they came to the same conclusion, it would have been right to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of systems of proportional representation. I hope that they will not close all options for future debate on that important subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly about the proposal to extend the period of councils from three years to four years. The arguments about implementation and policy formulation have been made well and I support them. I simply want to add that it is sensible to take into account that a four-year term will make it more likely for political groupings to consider mid-term internal reshuffles. Therefore, the proposal for four years gives a greater combination of continuity with change than the three-year scheme and I hope that the Minister will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had two debates in one. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, he would be surprised if I accepted the principle of proportional representation for local government elections in Scotland, but his surprise would be nothing compared with the shock of my hon. Friend the Whip if I were to do that. The other debate is whether the term of office should be three years or four years. I shall deal with that in a moment. There are reasoned arguments on either side of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen have not taken this opportunity to spell out their position on proportional representation, but I am not trying to encourage the hon. Member for Fife, Central to do so now. The Government have made it clear that we see no reason to change the first-past-the-post system which has served the country well. It is straightforward and easily understood by voters who know for whom and for what policies they are voting. I note the point of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) in relation to the hon. Member for Angus, East who has not spelt out the precise details of his proposal. Independent candidates would be at a serious disadvantage because they would not be members of a list system. For those and a range of other reasons which will be fairly familiar to the Committee, the Government do not accept that it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
be sensible to move to a system of proportional representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame, shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that the hon. Member is at all surprised that that is my recommendation to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the issue of the frequency of elections, clearly reasoned arguments can be put on different sides. There are two issues at stake in the discussion on the terms of office of the new councils. First, there is the question of whether elections should be held for the whole council, or on a rolling basis for parts of the council. Secondly, there is the question of the period between elections. In the Bill we have, of course, made provision for whole-council elections, reflecting the widespread view that was expressed in response to our consultation paper on internal management that this was the preferable solution. Prior to 1975, of course, in the cities and burghs but not elsewhere, a system of rolling annual elections by thirds was operated, but there is general agreement that this is outmoded. It is interesting that no member of the Committee has argued that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For reasons that we all regret, do we not, the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) is not a member of the Committee. I undertook for Mr. Harry Robertson, who has written to us all, to bring to the attention of the Scottish Office the fact that the sub committee of Perth and Kinross district council was unanimous that a term of office of only three years would not give any administration within local authorities time to formulate and implement policy commitments and would bring a large measure of uncertainty into policy formulation. That applies particularly in widespread country areas. I do not wish to pursue the matter any further. I am merely undertaking a promise that I made to Mr. Robertson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member, as will be those who put their point of view to him, for putting that on the record. It is perfectly clear that there can legitimately be different views on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say why this should be different in Scotland from the remainder of the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell my hon. Friend. The arguments about three-year or four-year terms were considered carefully last year by the internal management working group which comprised representatives of COSLA, local authorities and the Scottish Office, among others. No overall agreement emerged from those deliberations, though periods of both three and four years found their advocates. Our proposal for whole council elections every three years strikes a reasonable balance between giving the new councils a reasonable period during which they can formulate and implement their policies—the point about annual elections made by the hon. Member for Angus, East which I fully accept—and keeping them regularly accountable to their electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) that one must look back at the history of local government in Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rolling elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some were rolling and others were whole council elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the last reorganisation, electors had the opportunity to cast their local government vote every two years, albeit for different tiers of authority. In our view, there is advantage in terms of accountability in the local electorate casting their local vote every three years rather than four. That returns to the practice that prevailed across Scotland, other than in the cities and burghs where the elections were on a rolling basis, prior to 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, first, that the Committee should quite properly have had this debate and, secondly, that reasonable arguments can be made on both sides of the issue. In the end, it is a finely balanced argument. We have concluded, however, that a three-year term is the most sensible one to recommend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most disappointed with that Government response. I agree that there should be whole council elections, but I part company with the Minister on the period between those elections. There is a vast difference between the old three-year electoral system and the current arrangement. In size, scope and their operation of services, councils are now vastly different. We are not talking about the old council system which historically operated according to a three-year cycle. In the modern local government system, a four-year system works better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that initially I opposed the four-year system. I have seen it in practice, however, and it is much more suited to modern day local government. The Minister's reference to a historical three-year system is simply misplaced because the system itself has fundamentally altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire for his support. The points that I made are not party political but systemic. They relate to the system and running of local authorities, irrespective of the party in charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposed new system will have troubles enough settling down and doing its work. It already has enough in-built handicaps without another being added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A four-year election system would be more suited to modern day local government and would allow better and much more logical and thoughtful forward planning. Without the amendment the Minister would simply add another handicap to the proposed new local government system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised by the Government's failure to agree to proportional representation. I regret the silence on the subject from the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen, but no doubt clarification of their policy will come—as, indeed, will proportional representation. It will happen as part of wider changes. It will come for all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause, in effect, asks the Committee to accept the principle of proportional representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the hon. Gentleman's commitment to proportional representation, but once
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
again the hon. Member for Dundee, East raised a serious question when the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire was speaking of the problems of independent councillors. Does the hon. Gentleman have an answer to that difficult question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been problems within the present system for many years. In many ways it is sad that the number of independent candidates has reduced to almost nothing in the urban areas. Genuine independent councillors exist among genuine independents, basically in the more rural areas. They have survived and I believe that they would continue to survive under any proportional representation system. It is really up to the electorate. The proportional representation system is designed to reflect more truly the wishes of the electors. The problems for independent candidates, however, go wider than that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposition is that proportional representation will happen, for wider reasons than those I have given in support of the amendment. I invite the Committee to accept proportional representation as a new system for the new system of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are moving on to amendments that deal with important issues that affect many employees in Scotland. After the farcical nature of the boundary proposals, we are moving on to matters that affect ordinary people. The abstract nature of the boundary debate was such that we could not cover the key issues of daily life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are all about democracy. They seek to generate a debate on how 300,000 employees—one in seven of the Scottish work force and almost one in 10 of the Scottish electorate—can participate in the councils that employ them. That raises key questions about political rights, civil liberties and democratic freedoms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge that the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 and the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 make it impossible for employees to stand for election to the councils that employ them. The amendments seek to develop the consensus that we should take the issue seriously. In addition, we want a commitment from Ministers to move the dialogue forward if they share our concerns about empowerment and enfranchising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can believe the Government, Scotland is moving towards a system of unitary authorities. Let us jump back to pre-Wheatley and assume that the same situation existed in which employees could not participate. Then, those who wanted not only to work in local government, but to contribute to the public interest ethos, which is strong in Scotland, had a let out. There were counties, small and large burghs and district councils. From pre-Wheatley to the proposed structure the system has been based on two tiers. A teacher in Strathclyde could stand for Glasgow district council. People always had the option of deciding whether they wanted to participate in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is generally correct, but he is not in relation to the islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In mainland Scotland, people could exercise their rights to become involved at both elected and officer level. What is dramatic about the single-tier structure is that the Government have not thought through the issue involving 300,000 people. It is not a minority issue, affecting a few people in a few council areas. One in 10 of the electorate and one in seven of the work force is excluded from participation. I would have thought that the Government would have discussed the issue before it reached the Committee stage, accepted its importance and gone some way to allaying people's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
In a reply dated 7 February from the Secretary of State for Scotland to my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, the Government merely reaffirmed their position. They cited in their defence that there would be a basic conflict of interest and the fact that conditions in England and Wales are as they would like them to be in Scotland. They also quoted Committees of this House and other committees that have confirmed that people who work for an authority should not be eligible to stand for election to government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a practical, real problem relating to the accountability of senior council officials to people who work for them. The experience of the Co-operative Society sadly shows that it was unable to compete in the high street. Largely because of structural problems it could not manage efficiently. Does the hon. Gentleman think that those conditions should exist in local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will touch later on the issues that the hon. Gentleman has legitimately raised, but now I want to continue to discuss the substantial factors that reinforce the Opposition case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many officers who work in local government have embraced a public service ethos—a commitment to work in public service full time. A natural consequence is that those employees may want to participate at elected government level. The same ethos includes elected members and officials. It would be dramatically bad for the quality of Scottish local government if the Committee were to decide to reduce the pool of talent available to the new structure, if the Bill reaches the statute book. I should not like to think that we would do anything to diminish the quality of local government in future, regardless of the structure that is being imposed. The Government should take seriously the public service ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to emphasise the scale of the exclusion. If the Government were proposing a measure that would exclude a few thousand people, there might be an argument for it. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) pointed out that the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 restricts political involvement by certain key officers. It is the breathtaking scale of the exclusion that seems to have been lost on Ministers. I cannot understand why that should be so. I have referred to the letter from the Secretary of State, in which he reaffirmed the previous commitment. Do not the Government realise that in approaching a new structure for local government they should not diminish opportunities for participation? The Government have raised the question of the island authorities—Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles. The same principles apply, but the scale is dramatically different. We want the Government to acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anomalies also exist in the proposal. In the new local government structure, someone who works in an opted-out school will probably be able to participate in the council for the area where the school is located. However, someone who works in the education department will not. If conflict of interest is in question, is not it ludicrous that those issues should not have been tackled? The measure is creating two types of elector in Scotland among the 300,000—those who are involved, and who are barred from office, and those who are on the margins, but who,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
because of the technicalities of opting out, may participate. Colleges have recently been incorporated in Scotland. They can now participate in regional council elections, but those that remain in the education service cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contracting out, or privatisation, is a vital issue. If, in my authority of Fife, a cleaning contract is kept in-house, the people concerned, often on low wages and with little involvement in political activity, may not stand. If, next door, in room 303, a contract is given to the private sector, however, the employees transferred to that private sector contract may participate in the authority. Surely that cannot be right. Surely the same direct interest applies. The technicalities of the law are different, but an illogical burden is imposed on those who want to exercise their democratic rights and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further consideration will be the quangolatry that now haunts every aspect of government in Scotland. Will the three new super quangos and their employees be able to participate in authorities in Strathclyde, or will they be excluded? Inconsistencies are showing up in the spirit, at least, of the new structure, and, I suggest, in the letter of the law affecting technicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conflict of interest is also an issue that should influence our decision. I accept the valid point made by the hon. Member for Tayside, North that in any organisation in which people try to participate at elected and at officer level, conflict can arise. No one denies that for a minute, but I challenge the Government over the consistency of their argument about, for example, what is happening in local enterprise companies, hospital trusts and health boards. The Government argue, in defence of the system that they want to introduce in Scotland, that there will be a conflict of interest. Why is it, then, that for LECs, where there is a gravy train operating, there is no strong register of interests, no strong legislation to debar participation in conflict, and no tough, publicly scrutinised regulatory regime? Is not that a case of double standards? If the Government tell us that they want to apply the same tough exclusion clauses that they apply to local government, to every quango in Scotland, their words will have some resonance. However, they are not doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is confused—and I am saddened that he is confused—about the fact that elected councillors are effectively the employers and decision-makers for everyone who works for the council, including the chief executive and other executives. That means that in the circumstances he envisages, policies affecting the way in which officers carry out their tasks would be determined by an employee. That is quite different from any other structure that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned thus far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no confusion in our minds. I shall give an example. Employees and policy have been mentioned. As an analogy—I am not wandering off the subject, Sir James—LECs have directors. Directors devise policy and employees implement it. Why, then, are the directors permitted to be involved in obtaining loans of more than £100,000? The technicalities are different from those of the matter that we are dealing with, but the spirit of the issue is entirely the same. If the Government want
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
to pursue a straight, unequivocal strategy on conflict of interest, that is fine. They are not, however, doing that. Our defence of the participation by employees in their own authorities is that, if conflict of interest is taken seriously with regard to local government, it should also be taken seriously elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has not quite understood LECs correctly. He may be aware that the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs took evidence this week in Glasgow from Scottish Enterprise, which was asked directly what percentage of the turnover of grants and loans was taken up by directors or their associated companies. If I remember correctly the answer was less than 1 per cent. and clearly a correct declaration of interest had been made at the appropriate stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is trying very hard to make a case without too much evidence. I substantiate the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North—that the proposals of the hon. Member for Fife, Central concern employees, rather than people who are not remunerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are simply not listening. We do not differ from the Government on the technical issue of employees and the different legislation involved, but they fail to recognise the spirit of conflict of interest. Does the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside suggest that graft to the tune of £50 million is important but that if it is only up to £50,000 we should not worry about it? That is a ludicrous suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing for a level playing field. Do not lecture us on the conflict of interests that may arise in local government when Scotland is presently littered with excesses such as directors taking money out for preferential schemes when they are involved as policy makers in the same process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we be clear about this? The Opposition have tabled amendment No. 132 not because they disagree with the Government's conclusions, but in order to make allegations about LECs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your indulgence, Sir James, the Minister's contribution does not require a response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he did not disgree with the Government's line on the issue of an employee being a member of a council. Did I understand him correctly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must repeat myself. We are talking about the conflict of interest. If it is a system for the Government's friends and cronies and the cosy clique that runs the unelected parts of Scotland they want to apply one set of standards. But it is different if it is an elected body, if it is about people who make a valuable and continuing commitment perhaps over 20, 30 or 40 years. Are we to believe that they will act any less responsibly than those the Government favour with different standards in quangos throughout Scotland? That is the issue. It is that spirit of conflict of interest that the Government are displaying to defend the indefensible in terms of local government single-tier reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking about the blanket exlusion. Clearly the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Unison and all the other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
public sector trade unions involved in local government that are deeply committed to providing valuable services are worried about the blanket exclusion. As no consensus has been visited upon the first clause of the Bill in terms of boundaries, I had hoped that the Government could have recognised that in local government, in the trade unions and among the Opposition parties there is a genuine desire to offer a level playing field to employees. That may be with restrictions. One of our amendments suggests that that could be by order of the Secretary of State. We appreciate that there are problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the message is getting across to the Government? To say that a council employee who is duly elected by the citizens of his or her ward to serve as a councillor will automatically be involved in corruption and graft and will be unable to fulfil his or her duty is surely an insult to democracy and to the councillors. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It also disregards the fact that council house tenants who currently serve as councillors can, and do, obtain dispensations about voting on rents. I know of no problems there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intervention by the hon. Member for Angus, East has obviously hit home with the Government. I do not need to comment further. He raises the important issue that in Scotland there has been a drift away from a recognition that democracy matters. That is the central theme of the debate. We are merely seeking to acknowledge publicly, which the Government will not do, the commitment made by employees in Scotland—the 300,000 of them from the highest paid chief executive to the home help doing two hours a week. Are we really to say that although they have made a commitment to the welfare of thousands of people, under the single-tier structure they are now to be debarred from making a contribution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr said that local government was just a hobby. Therefore, people will be debarred from participating in local government as a hobby. We do not regard it as a hobby; it is a serious business. We support the hon. Member for Angus, East who said that the Committee must make a distinction between unelected government and the sleaze that surrounds it, and, on the other hand, high-quality, excellent services provided by people in local government who want not to make money on the side or be involved in graft or corruption, but simply to participate in their councils' activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has taken out of context my comments about a hobby. I stressed the commitment and involvement that was required, but the hon. Gentleman referred to sleaze. With regard to remarks about the LECs and a gravy train, I refer the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. The objective of a Committee is to study in depth the matters before it, including amendments.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to generate a lively and vigorous debate about the quality of democracy in Scotland if this crazy reorganisation proceeds. We are asking the Government to take seriously the position of the employees on whom the reorganisation will have dramatic effects. Their lives, jobs and aspirations and the public interest will be affected. I hope that when the Minister responds he will not close the door on an issue that deserves to be treated seriously and which the Opposition are willing to discuss in considerable detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I compliment the hon. Gentleman on the way in which he is now presenting his case. I am proud that I am here, working at my hobby, and I enjoy every minute of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am in a generous mood and am looking for converts, I accept the point. It depends on the definition of hobby. The point was made earlier about political leaders of local government and a hobby. We are talking about a vocation, an important public interest ethos. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North is lining up with that—which he is and we respect that—it is incumbent on us to appreciate that in local government, there are potentially 300,000 candidates who, with qualification and based on regulations made by the Secretary of State, wish to participate in it so that they can develop their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like a reasoned response. I hope that the debate is not terminated today. If the Government are willing, it can be opened up so that we can find a solution to this difficult problem.

What demeans our proceedings is the type of speech that, in part, we heard from the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister at all concerned about graft, corruption and sleaze in LECs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The Government are concerned to ensure that taxpayers' money is properly spent at all times. The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs is currently considering the Scottish Enterprise network. The Government will take seriously, as we always do, any recommendations that it may make. However, we cannot take seriously and we cannot regard with anything other than the most utter contempt, those unsubstantiated allegations made today by the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is suggesting that there is no evidence of conflicts of interest in LECs. I remind him that the chairman designate of Scottish Enterprise Tayside took the honourable step of resigning because he perceived a conflict of interest in his role. The chief executive also resigned because of a conflict of interest. Conflicts of interest are found in LECs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would rather the Minister does not follow up that intervention. We are not debating Scottish Enterprise companies. I allowed the hon. Member for Dundee, East to make the point because there was an analogy, but we are not here to debate those companies. If the Minister intends to mention them, I hope that he will do so briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. No one has suggested that there cannot be potential conflicts of intersts. The two cases that have been described show how, in different circumstances, potential conflicts of interests in the LEC network have been solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following your advice, Sir James, I shall deal with the important and difficult matter before the Committee. The hon. Member for Fife, Central suggested that the Government have not taken the matter seriously. We have, and if he had taken the trouble to read the internal management consultation paper which we issued, he would know that the Government have taken the matter seriously. It was one of the issues aired in the consultation paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
Prior to publication of the paper, the issues had been carefully considered by a joint Scottish Office and local authority working party with input from lcoal authorities at elected member and official levels. Let us be clean the Government have taken the matter extremely seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall report to the Committee the responses to the consultation process made by trade unions and others in local government and beyond. Responsible people responded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this will be a responsible intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be as responsible as I always am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask a specific question. The Minister is aware of a letter to me from Councillor Hugh Henry of Renfrew district council because I passed a copy to him. The letter discusses section 67 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Councillor Henry writes that he is currently employed by Strathclyde regional council, but he states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the rules stand ex councillors cannot be employees where they were previously councillors for a period of 12 months."</p></blockquote>
Many people are in the same situation. Will new authorities be regarded as different, allowing someone currently employed by Strathclyde regional council and a district councillor within Strathclyde to continue in a shadow authority? The Minister has given me a helpful handwritten note, but a reply on the record would be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Paisley, South asked a serious and responsible question that is directly related to the amendment. I can confirm what I wrote and tell the hon. Gentleman that section 67 of the 1973 Act, which provides for a 12-month quarantine period, would not apply in such circumstances. I am happy to put that assurance on the record so that the hon. Gentleman can pass the information to the councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responses to the serious consultation process highlighted the sharp division of opinion generally and in local government. The Government paid particularly close attention to the responses of local authorities and organisations such as the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the Society of Directors of Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While expressing some reservations about the number that would be affected if the rules remain unchanged, SODA rightly pointed out that the long-standing statutory prohibition exists to remove the conflict or potential for conflict between the public and private interests that would otherwise occur in respect of the councillor-employee concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no way does that suggest, as the hon. Member for Angus, East implied, any sort of smear or criticism of the hard work and dedication that local authority employees in Scotland bring to their task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the problem in a nutshell the fact that if a director responsible for a council department has a clearly defined policy which an employee who is a councillor disagrees with, that employee could make it very difficult for the director to carry out his policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is the point that members of the Society of Directors of Administration made. It said that there could be considerable problems in respect of the relationship an employee, who was also a councillor, would have with his employing authority or his manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SODA concluded that the conflict of interest was an absolute one, and that it was not therefore possible to suggest posts that could be expected from the general prohibition. I agree with the hon. Member for Fife, Central that it is right to consider whether there could be exceptions. Indeed, we have considered that point. I am merely reporting the view of SODA, which is that the conflict of interest is absolute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's courtesy in giving way. Apart from the prohibited posts, could not the problem of conflicting interests be overcome by transparency and openness? In the past, it was perfectly acceptable for councillors who were council house tenants to participate in decisions on council house rents. The Minister's route would exclude about 300,000 citizens from their democratic right to be elected by their fellow citizens and to perform their functions as councillors openly and transparently. Is not that openness and transparency the answer to any conflict of interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not believe that to be the case, and nor did the members of SODA. The potential conflict of interests regarding council house tenants who were also councillors would be very limited in relating solely to council housing matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be my fault for not hearing quite clearly what the Minister said about SOLACE, but I wonder whether he could clarify his remarks. On 26 January 1993, SOLACE produced its document, and item 7 of the conclusion said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We feel that the new Councils should be free to adopt and amend internal management arrangements suitable for their purposes and that the use of models or the imposition of prescriptive arrangements should be avoided."</p></blockquote>
I admit that I may have misunderstood, but do the Minister's remarks run contrary to the views of SOLACE?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. May I make it clear that of course we took the views of SOLACE very seriously? The views that I have just referred to are those of SODA; SOLACE, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are just about to conclude this morning's proceedings. I will, of course, allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene when we resume, if he still wishes to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SODA also took the view that public perception would undoubtedly be that there would be a conflict of interest in the nature of such a situation, and that that should be avoided to ensure high public regard for the standards that should apply in public office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we resume, I should like to report to the Committee the views of other bodies—notably Highland regional council—including some councils which had different views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee adjourns, I remind hon. Members that we will be in Room 12 this afternoon, so all papers should now be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
