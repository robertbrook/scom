<time>Thursday 24 February 1994</time>
<p><i>(Morning)</i></p>
<p>[SIR MICHAEL J. MARTIN <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<div class='debates'><span class='label label-warning'>debates</span>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I wish to raise a serious issue, on which I seek your guidance. First, I refer you to yesterday's <i>Hansard.</i> In relation to a reference in the Chamber to this Committee's proceedings, Madam Speaker said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have procedures here whereby we do not refer to what is taking place in Committee. That Committee work stands on its own until it is reported to the House."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 23 February 1994; Vol. 238, c.267.]</p></blockquote>
I also draw your attention, Mr. Martin, to an article on the front page of this morning's edition of <i>The Herald</i> in Glasgow, which is headlined "RCs win school concessions". That relates to amendments, some of which are currently on the amendment paper and others which, it would appear, will be tabled later. I am concerned, for the integrity of the Committee and our discussions, about what appears to be the intention of the Scottish Office Minister for Education and Housing, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). The article said that he wrote a letter to Bishop Devine of Motherwell indicating that
<br><blockquote><p>"he was bringing forward an amendment which, he hoped, would allay the Church's fears."</p></blockquote>
I ask you, Mr. Martin, for a guarantee that members of the Committee will be kept abreast of amendments that are on the amendment paper and those that are promised by the Minister.<br><br>
Why is the Minister writing to an outside organisation, telling it not only that there will be an amendment, but what it will say? According to the article, the Minister claimed that it would
<br><blockquote><p>"help to reinforce the requirement that, before any change in school catchment area can occur, not only will local authorities have to undertake extensive consultation exercises, but also, where appropriate, the consent of the Secretary of State must be obtained".</p></blockquote>
I have already tabled amendments, which are on the amendment paper, in relation to this specific subject. If a Minister gives assurances on this subject—which is the business of this Committee—and if he says that he will table an amendment with a specific purpose, surely that information should be made available to all members of the Committee. It should not merely be sent to one bishop of the Roman Catholic church who happened to attend a Tory fund-raising dinner last Friday night.<br><br>
Archbishop Winning, who is the chairman of the bishops' conference and who has already written to every member of this Committee, indicated specific concerns that go beyond individual catchment areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</span></span><i>rose—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member has not finished. There is enough background noise. When an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
hon. Member raises a point of order, I should hope that there would be some silence and due regard given to the person who is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue is not one of party politics, but of concern for the work of the Committee. The Committee cannot operate in relation to amendments that are or will be tabled if there are discussions between Ministers and others outside and announcements are made.<br><br>
The article further states that Bishop Devine
<br><blockquote><p>"met Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie about the church's concerns and also had behind-the-scenes meetings with the Government, which sees him as a man to do business with."</p></blockquote>
I cannot understand why the business of the Committee appears to be conducted not in debate in Committee, but during a dinner that was held to raise funds for the Conservative party—<i>[Interruption.]</i> If this or any Minister at the Scottish Office writes to anyone outside about amendments that will come before the Committee, every member of the Committee should be privy to that information and to the justification for it. What the Minister promises does not seem to go beyond anything that is not already on the amendment paper. Given the seriousness of the issue, and the fact that Ministers are corresponding with one bishop in particular, I hope that you, Mr. Martin, can give us the assurance that the debate and decision will take place in Committee, not at a Tory fund-raising dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Before you answer the previous point of order, I should like your clarification. You and I have served on many Standing Committees in this House. You will be aware that in relation to the contentious reform of the trade union laws, it was standard practice to have negotiations of the kind that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) is complaining about—I can give the Committee chapter and verse—with trade unions. The Ministers responsible said that they would introduce amendments at a later stage once the details had been sorted out and the technical aspects considered.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's point is nonsense. He obviously has not spent enough time in Standing Committees, where such practice is common.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me try to answer the point of order. I am as keen as anyone for whatever information is available to be made available to the Committee, as it helps everyone concerned. However, I have only certain powers. If the Minister can explain why letters were sent regarding the business of the Committee, that might take the heat out of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I think that I can explain very quickly. The amendments will be tabled today. Members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy are perfectly entitled to make representations, and there have been a number of meetings. We have considered the representations carefully and have sought to respond to them. I am only too happy to make available to the Committee the letters that have been sent. I will ensure that the letters to Bishop
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
Devine and also the letter to Archbishop Winning, the chairman of the Roman Catholic education committee, are placed on the Table so that all members of the Committee can see them.<br><br>
I do not know why the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) referred to a dinner. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is a Minister and will know that when someone is on his feet there should be no background noise. That goes for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton is right that this is a matter of great importance and that members of the Committee are entitled to know exactly what has been put in writing. I will make certain that the letters are put on the Table. I will do that straight away, as they were photocopied this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Has the Minister finished his statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me reply to what the Minister said. The point of order raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton is not a matter for the Chair. I have allowed the Minister to clarify the position. He will put the letters on the Table so that everyone will be privy to the information.<br><br>
I hope that any further point of order raised will not be on this matter. I have no powers to do anything more than I have done so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><i>rose—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman's point will not be further to the matter on which I have just ruled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it is: further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister referred to letters that he sent to members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Can the hon. Gentleman make it clear to the Committee that Bishop Devine of Motherwell does not represent the Roman Catholic hierarchy in this case, and that there is a Catholic education committee? Can he clarify the capacity in which he wrote to Bishop Devine? What role does the bishop have in the Roman Catholic hierarchy? I understand that the hierarchy does not agree with Bishop Devine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As has already been said, both Government and Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen consult various organisations. Whether they consult representatives or anyone else in those organisations is nothing to do with the Chair. Bishop Devine's status in Catholic education is nothing to do with the Chair or the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It may be helpful to know why the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) objects to my hon. Friend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
writing to Bishop Devine. On Friday, Bishop Devine came out forcefully in favour of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and all that he is doing. Labour Members cannot hack that. If my hon. Friend had written to another Catholic bishop, we would not have heard these comments. The issue has been raised only because my hon. Friend wrote to Bishop Devine, who came out publicly to express full support for the Prime Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat what I have said. It has nothing to do with the proceedings of the Committee. I hope that we shall not hear any more about Bishop Devine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I hope to be helpful. As a newcomer to the House, I find this matter difficult. When Catholic catchment areas were raised in the Committee during our first sitting, which was disrupted, the Minister did not state how he felt about the amendments on the amendment paper.<br><br>
As the Chairman, Mr. Martin, could you give some instruction or guidance to clarify matters for the Committee and to suggest that when matters are raised in early sittings of the Committee, the Minister should come back to us with a response as soon as possible? This issue was raised on 16 and 18 February. Only today—24 February—are we hearing what the Minister thinks. That does not help us. Will you suggest to Ministers that we should be informed earlier and not discover things from articles in newspapers or from letters after they have been sent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the Minister what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful, though.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if we got on with the Committee's business. I cannot tell the Minister what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It is not about Bishop Devine. For the future conduct of the Committee, will you rule, Mr. Martin, that the Opposition's suggestion is unconstitutional? They have suggested that it is wrong of the Government to listen to outside bodies and to recognise that they have made good points which we shall cover by tabling amendments. That is an amazing doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Minister of my comment that members of the Committee are entitled to meet outside organisations and draw on their experience? If we did not do that, we would be working in a vacuum. I have made that point clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Where the Government are wrong is that this important matter has had to be dragged out of them in this fashion and that there was a delay before the Committee was informed. However, I hope that the story is true. If it is, I shall be grateful for small mercies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Hamilton wants to raise a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. First, may I thank the Minister for giving us the letters? I appreciate the fact that he has shared the correspondence with members of the Committee. It was right and proper that he should do so. I feel that, perhaps, we should not have had to draw the information out in this way, but it has been helpful to the Committee that the correspondence has been published.<br><br>
However, I deeply resent the remarks about my comments on Bishop Devine made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), who throws mud and then disappears from the Committee Room. I know Bishop Devine: he is a friend. He is the bishop for the area that I represent and I have come to know and respect him over the years. His political views are a matter for him. He can hold whatever views he wants. My point had nothing to do with his reputation and standing as a bishop of the Church. He is a man of fine character. The slur cast by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, who could not wait for a response, should not stand as anything other than a political smear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this is the last of it and that we can get on with the business in hand.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. It may surprise you but I am trying to help. I believe that the conduct of the Committee must follow the rules of the House. The hon. Member for Hamilton shows his obvious lack of experience of the conduct of Committees and of the rules of the House on how these matters can and cannot be addressed in the Chamber. It is sheer humbug for him to try to make a political point. He has inconvenienced the Committee and the Chair by raising a point of order to make a political point that had little to do with the conduct of the Committee. He knows, I know and you know, Mr. Martin, that if the usual channels were not clogged as they are at the moment all those matters would have been discussed through them. The easy distribution of papers goes on in the normal way. That is the way that the House conducts its business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Mr. Martin. This will probably be of more interest to Sidney Devine than Bishop Devine. I have been given a copy of today's <i>Lennox Herald by</i> the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). It reports that Luss community council is under investigation by Dumbarton district council and that at a public meeting held by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton the local people opposed the move of Luss from Argyll. It states that the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) was misinformed in the information he gave. In the light of that, should we not reconsider this matter so that we can get proper and accurate information?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Ayr must be patient; let me reply to the hon. Member for Carrick,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). The hon. Member was seeking to put something on the record. He has done that but it was not a point of order. Let us now get on with the business. These matters can be considered on Report</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Would you confirm that not only was the point of order by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley not a point of order but that he should not have been reading from a newspaper?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. When I referred previously to the reading of newspapers it applied to hon. Members who were not taking part in the debate.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 17</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 12, line 40, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>", and any such scheme shall continue in effect the provisions of any scheme made by an existing authority in accordance with Section 105 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 the terms of which have been agreed by a new authority or authorities.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is simply to ensure that the transfer of educational endowments to the new authorities is by agreement between authorities rather than on the decision of the Secretary of State. The justification for that is that the transfer of educational endowments should as far as possible be by agreement between authorities rather than on the decision of an individual Minister.<br><br>
Clause 17(7) limits the Secretary of State's powers only to making no more changes than appear to him to be necessary or expedient following the local government boundary changes. No recognition is therefore given to possible agreements reached between authorities. Clause 17(6) details the extent to which the Secretary of State may act but that overlaps with section 105 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. It is important that clarification is sought between this provision in the Bill and that section of the 1980 Act. It is that clarification that I seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions to ask and I should like to make a comment. The clause deals with a small matter in the context of a huge Bill and the issues that we have dealt with and shall deal with. It may pale into insignificance in comparison. Nevertheless it is very important. To give an example, I was examining the educational endowments, the trusts and funds of Strathclyde region. Admittedly it is the largest region, but it has more than 750 trusts, with different purposes and eligibility criteria.<br><br>
It is very expensive to administer the trusts, but they are extremely valuable. In Strathclyde the value amounts to nearly £2 million, which could be used to enhance and develop education in the region. However, much of that money is tied up. An example that will interest my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) is the John McMaster bursaries. It has been the subject of inter-department correspondence in Strathclyde authority because there have been no recent applications for the fund—I knew that my hon. Friend would be interested—yet it has income of nearly £75,000. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
money is tied up in a fund. No applications have been made, so it cannot be applied for educational purposes. At the same time, as you, Mr. Martin, know better than anyone, there is great educational need in Strathclyde. Strathclyde is considering ways of releasing the money, but the legal procedure is very complicated. A memorandum from Strathclyde legal department to the education department—which I shall not read out—enumerates all the problems arising for a council that wants to release such money for wider purposes that might attract more applications.<br><br>
Would it be possible to insert into the Bill a clause to enable new local authorities, of whatever size or structure, more easily to adopt a flexible approach to the application of the funds? That is my only question to the Minister. I am not making a party political point. Such a provision would be advantageous to all the new authorities, and would mean that money that is now unused could be used for educational purposes. I hope that the Government will seriously consider some provision along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for raising the matter. He suggested that it would be good to proceed by way of agreement. I agree with that sentiment, but in my view safeguards are necessary to ensure fairness and equity. The amendment would require any scheme made under clause 17 to continue in effect the provisions of any scheme made by an existing authority where the terms of that scheme have been agreed by the new authority or authorities.<br><br>
We do not believe that the terms of the amendment would be appropriate, because education authorities control many educational endowments. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley mentioned the large number in Strathclyde. Many have been amalgamated into larger funds. Where the area of the existing authority will be divided between two or more new authorities—which will certainly be the case in Strathclyde—it will not normally be appropriate to vest the endowment in one authority. We want fairness and fair play. The Secretary of State therefore requires power to make new schemes transferring the existing endowments to the new authorities. If it is appropriate to transfer a particular endowment to one of the new authorities, the Secretary of State will be able to do so under the clause as drafted. However, he also requires discretion to deal with the situation where that would not be appropriate, as is likely in the case of many of the endowments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If—and I gather that it is a fairly big "if—the Government decide that there are to be residuary authorities, will the relevant power be transferred to the residuary authority in the transition period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that it could be. The provisions are safeguards to ensure that there is fair play about endowments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley asked for flexibility. As an advocate, I shall give him an unpaid legal opinion. A certain amount depends on the wording of the terms of the endowment. There is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
a large number of endowments covering a huge range of educational purposes.<br><br>
The amendment, if accepted, would restrict the Secretary of State's ability to make schemes which fairly divide endowments between the relevant new authorities, taking account of all the circumstances. If proposals are put forward by an existing authority, which are acceptable to the new authority or authorities and are fair and reasonable in themselves, the Secretary of State can give effect to them in the new scheme. In cases where a number of new authorities could lay claim to an interest in the scheme, views are less likely to be unanimous, and the Secretary of State needs the freedom to consider all views and the reasonableness of the overall result. That is adequately dealt with in the clause as drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his free legal advice. He is a distinguished advocate, so it will be valuable. Existing legislation permits the Secretary of State to prepare schemes for the reorganisation of educational endowments. The Committee should consider the example of the McMaster bursaries.<br><br>
They were set up by the will of Mr. John McMaster, who was born at Kirkoswald and educated at Girvan. He gained a good education in what is now part of my constituency, but was not when he was born on 21 June 1841, which is a little before my time.<br><br>
The scheme for the award of the John McMaster bursaries states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bursaries shall be tenable in any Faculty of either Glasgow University or Edinburgh University, or in the event of there not being in any year suitable applicants for bursaries tenable at either of these Universities, at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The bursaries are open only to boys"—</p></blockquote>
which is restrictive—
<br><blockquote><p>"who are under 18 years of age on the first day of January in the year in which the bursaries are competed for, who are in attendance at Girvan Secondary School … whose parents are resident in Girvan"</p></blockquote>
and who need financial assistance.<br><br>
If no one, year by year, comes into the categories, applies for the bursaries or goes to Glasgow or Edinburgh universities, the money will not be used. It would be open to the education committee to go through the legal procedure of expanding the terms for the award of that money. That has to be examined, but it takes time. Can the Minister find a way of giving power to the Secretary of State to make it easier for there to be a greater degree of flexibility—without the opportunity for the misuse or misapplication of the funds—to allow the money to be applied for a wider purpose at the discretion of local authorities? That would mean that they would not have to go through complicated legal procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 105 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 gives such powers to education authorities. If there is a disagreement between new authorities, it is only fair that the Secretary of State should have discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sat for some time as a councillor on the Stirlingshire educational trust. It was trapped in the dim and distant past. For example, its first duty was to take the beneficiaries and their spouses for a trip. I found that strange.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
A large amount of the money in the trust was spent taking people for a tour of Stirlingshire. I presume that the idea came about at a time when beneficiaries were impoverished artisans who did not go on such trips. People were taken by bus to eat at the hotel in Drymen. Then they would take the steamer up Loch Lomond, catch another bus to another hotel and have another high tea. That seemed to be the prime function of the Stirlingshire educational trust. In fact, its first duty was that sort of poor boys' outing. People today are really looking for a bursary to do a course at college or university rather than to be taken on a trip.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
We seemed unable to change Stirlingshire educational trust's prime function, so deeply was it locked into time. The amendment, particularly given the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley spoke to it, would provide the necessary flexibility without having to make great legal changes. That seems sensible. There is no malice involved and no political point is being made. We just want common sense.<br><br>
There are probably many trusts, such as the McMaster bursaries and the Stirlingshire educational trust, which could do with being taken down from the shelves. The Minister says that that power lies with the education authority. However, because Stirlingshire was, except in the minds and hearts of the people of Stirlingshire, written out of local government statute, there are people on the Stirlingshire educational trust from Falkirk district, Stirling district, the regional council and other organisations.<br><br>
The trusts need to be updated. They must be dug out and used for the benefit of people in the area to which they can apply. The amendment would help that. I hope that the Minister will accept it or introduce a similar provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley that the trusts are becoming increasingly important. We must all have constituents who cannot gain access to the student grants scheme, which is so restricted just now. We have written to the Minister whose officials have sent to us helpful fists of trusts from which potential students may get money. Those endowments may go back into the mists of history, but they are valuable for narrow categories of people who may not otherwise be able to pursue certain courses.<br><br>
We may have stumbled on yet another cost of the reorganisation. Who will pay? The Minister said that there will be no problem when a consensus exists between the existing and successor authorities about who gets what share of which endowment New free-standing trusts will be established to disburse the money within the new local government areas. There may be complications, however, when more than one successor authority falls heir to those endowments.<br><br>
The Minister has already given legal advice to my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I suspect that much legal advice will be required in redistributing complicated endowments that are tied up by antiquated conditions, such those described by my hon. Friend the' Member for Falkirk, East (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
Connarty). Who will pay for that? Will the legal cost of redistributing endowments come out of the endowments, or will they be paid for by the local authorities or by the Scottish Office? It would be deplorable if the scarce endowment funds were to be raided to cover what could be significant legal costs associated with redistribution disputes. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like another try to persuade the Minister to do something more. He said rightly that the power exists, but that is a complicated and expensive way of dealing with the matter. I shall read from the memorandum of Strathclyde legal services:
<br><blockquote><p>"In order to bring the amended endowment into being, reference must be made to Sections 112-121 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 as amended.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The authority must prepare a draft and send copies to the 'governing bodies' of the endowments concerned."—</p></blockquote>
that is okay—
<br><blockquote><p>"It must also give notice of its proposals by way of newspaper adverts and other public inspection of its proposals. The governing body of the endowment or any person interested has one month from the first notice of the scheme to state objections or proposed amendments thereto. If neither are received, the authority may resolve to make the draft scheme effectual. This would have to be done by the full Council.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If, however, objections and amendments are received, the authority must consider these. If any objections are received from any of:—
<ol>
<li>the governing body of the endowment</li>
<li>a District Council"—</li></ol></p></blockquote>
that needs changing—
<br><blockquote><p>"3. any other education authority</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>4. 20 or more Council Tax payers of any place affected by the scheme</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>5. or any person having a vested interest in the endowment,"—</p></blockquote>
that covers many people—
<br><blockquote><p>"the authority is required to hold a Public Local Inquiry into such of the objections that are not withdrawn.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The authority may thereafter resolve that the draft scheme becomes effectual or not, as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
That is a far too complicated and cumbersome procedure. It is an expensive way of releasing some of the money tied up in the old endowments.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give some thought to simplifying the procedure, so that the £2 million tied up in Strathclyde—no doubt, similar amounts are tied up elsewhere—can be released more easily for educational use. If nothing else, I hope that the Minister will say that he will take the amendment away and consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The history of the clause, which seems to be welcomed on both sides of the Committee, dates back only to 1980 when the Government introduced in section 105 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 the right of local authorities to determine the outcome of educational trusts. Before that date, the right was in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is another example of the devolution that the Government have practised recently?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that.<br><br>
I inform the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that the costs are believed to be de minimis, but the revenue support grant settlement will take account of that in the overall settlement made.<br><br>

I shall reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, and to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who asked for the reorganisation powers to be given to the Secretary of State. The powers existed, but in 1981, they were given to education authorities. It is argued that it is best to deal with matters at a local authority level as much as possible. In the case of a large authority such as Strathclyde, however, there is need for fairness in the distribution of endowments. Therefore, the Secretary of State should have the powers to ensure that matters are dealt with fairly.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley also referred to complexity. The Secretary of State's powers in the clause will simplify matters and will make it easier to resolve disputes. Some of the components of a large scheme may be complex and it may not be a simple exercise. For that reason, it is appropriate that the Secretary of State should have the powers.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 14, leave out lines 6 to 8.<br><br>
This raises the issue of common good funds. I utter a warning about the difficulty of this. Some years ago, when I represented part of the constituency that is now represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East the question of the Bo'ness sea chest arose. Who had keys and who was entitled to distribute funds from the Bo'ness sea chest would have taxed the minds of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. It would have been admirable material for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. .<br><br>
There is a great deal of sensitivity attached to the distribution of those ancient moneys which were for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
benefit of a particular place. How will those ancient rights be safeguarded?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of us had anticipated the hon. Gentleman's question. Common good funds relate to many issues which are not to do with educational endowments and may be dealt with separately. It is not our desire to interfere with common good funds—they are extremely important I shall look into the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman about it However, I think that it comes under other parts of local government law, and does not relate to educational endowments. That is my provisional view, but I shall look further into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have chosen an example that was not watertight The sea chest is partly for educational purposes. However, the John Newland scholarships in Bathgate are definitely and exclusively for educational purposes. There would be great perturbation if those moneys were somehow wafted away to areas outside that to which they were bequested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that as far as I am concerned, there is no possibility of that happening.<br><br>
The purpose of subsection (13) is simply to make it clear beyond doubt that the Secretary of State's powers under clause 17 do not affect other existing powers to reorganise educational endowments. The powers of reorganisation contained in part VI of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 will be available to the new authorities, just as they are available to the existing authorities. Similarly, the common law powers of the courts in relation to trusts are unaffected.<br><br>
We see no benefit to the new authorities—or others—arising from this proposed change. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendment<br><br>
Obviously, we want the maximum continuity. If the hon. Gentleman believes that there will be any problems in relation to the case he mentioned, I shall look into the matter. However, I genuinely believe that no such problems will arise.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask a rather careful question. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) wrote to me on 22 February in response to my questions on residuary bodies. On page 2, the last sentence of the answer to my first question reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"This might include, for example, computer equipment if there was a general agreement among the new authorities in an area that the residuary body should continue to carry out the regional computing function for a limited period."</p></blockquote>
That suggests a move from a property arena to the functions of operation. The computer system for educational bursaries operated by Lothian region at

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 597</span>
Torphichen street is one of the many examples. Is it intended that a residuary body, if there be one, will have functions of operation?</span></p>
<p>11.15am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is referring to my letter, perhaps I could respond to his point. We envisage that a residuary body would be set up only with the agreement of the authorities. Such a body is, of course, set up for only a limited period. Computer equipment could be taken over as well as buildings. Therefore, a residuary body could undertake the functions associated with that equipment during its limited existence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not very clear. That is not the point in our proceedings at which to pursue the matter, but it is important to establish that a residuary body could operate the various computer systems and areas envisaged in the Bill. We shall return to that issue.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 17, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>

Clause 18</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
RESIDUARY BODIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 14, line 16, after "may", insert
<br><blockquote><p>", following agreement with such associations of local authorities as exist,".</p></blockquote>
This is a major amendment. It would ensure that a residuary body cannot be established without the agreement of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which would ensure that the proposal had the support of the authorities concerned.<br><br>
There should in theory be no need for a residuary body. The property commission can produce guidelines and deal with any property issues that cannot be settled in accordance with guidelines. Current local authority estates and property officers can reallocate all local authority property to successor boards, authorities and councils. Filtering out "non operational" property would leave new councils seriously hampered in their ability to develop and implement planning and economic policies.<br><br>
As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State may by order establish a residuary body under clause 18. He may by order vest in the residuary body different categories of property and as a result the residuary body may be vested with all, some or none of existing local authority property.<br><br>
A number of assumptions made in the Touche Ross report caused considerable concern. First, residuary bodies will take over all the assets of outgoing authorities. Secondly, they will transfer property to incoming authorities and dispose of surplus assets. Thirdly, they will operate for four to five years The Minister indicates assent. Are we right in assuming that it is the intention that residuary bodies, if they are established, will operate for four or five years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I prefer to answer all the hon. Gentleman's answers in one go.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fourth assumption is that receipts from sale of surplus property will fund the costs of the body in whole or in part.<br><br>
If property is transferred to a residuary body, it is that body which will determine whether a property is operational or surplus. That will mean that decisions about the allocation of operational property will not be made by professional practitioners. I shall give two examples.<br><br>
First, a residuary body might decide that a new council with six secondary schools in its area needed only five. Secondly, a residuary body could determine that all industrial units, business centres, shopping centres and development land are not operationally required and could be disposed of. That has implications for the furthering of a council's economic and planning strategies. There are similar implications to the asset stripping that occurred in the run-up to the demise of the Scottish Development Agency and is currently happening in the new towns.<br><br>
I no longer represent the Deans and Knightsridge areas of Livingston, but, being a parliamentary neighbour of my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and knowing a good deal about the new town, I can assure the Committee that the problem is real—it is by no means an Aunt Sally.<br><br>
No residuary body was set up under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Residuary bodies appeared in the 1986 reorganisation, which took place in England and Wales. Under the Local Government Act 1986, which abolished the metropolitan county councils, all property was transferred to the residuary bodies. The Tyne and Wear residuary body was set up nine months before abolition and wound up 18 months after. There were no local authority representatives on it.<br><br>
The Tyne and Wear residuary body could sell for value to a district council property which that council wanted but which it could not convince the residuary body it needed. The Tyne and Wear body took the strict definition of operational property, and land held for planning purposes could be deemed non-operational and passed to the residuary body for disposal.<br><br>
The Tyne and Wear residuary body identified surplus property as including, first, property on the market; secondly, property about to be marketed; thirdly, town centre land and reclaimed sites; fourthly, headquarters accommodation being vacated and land held for schemes no longer active; and, fifthly, any other property not claimed by a district.<br><br>
Loss of commercial property has serious implications in terms of loss of income for authorities, particularly if the disposal proceeds of surplus properties fund the residuary bodies rather than augment capital spending and reduce loan debt in the new councils. Loss of land not deemed currently to be operational could result in the absurd situation of new councils having to acquire land to implement capital programmes which had only recently been transferred to the residuary body and disposed of.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East catches your eye, Mr. Martin, because he of all people knows about the considerable problems of Stirling and of Falkirk. I have stated the problem in general terms, but it is by no means confined to Stirling and Falkirk.<br><br>
It never does any case in the House of Commons good if it is overegged. I am not pretending that there is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
mismatch of property throughout Scotland. In places, it might mirror in nicely. For example, yesterday I talked to the district clerk of Kirkcudbright, John Howie, who, with his convener, John Maxwell, is extremely vexed at some of the things that the Government are doing. Nevertheless, I concede that in the south-west of Scotland there may be no problem. However, there is a problem in other parts of Scotland, and the Government have to consider it. An example could include land that might be held for a proposed new school not in a current capital programme. That land could pass to the residuary body and be sold, therefore making the implementation of a future capital programme extremely difficult and costly.<br><br>
The Secretary of State, on the advice of the property commission, can simply, as in 1975, produce a property order giving guidelines about the transfer of property to successor authorities. That would probably include arrangements for temporary user's rights in offices and depots and equitable arrangements for shared use. The requirements for authorities to have an asset register in place by April 1995 further simplifies the allocation of property.<br><br>
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland believes that a residuary body is not necessary for the transfer of property in Scotland. Councils are well placed, through their property professionals, to identify which properties are required and which can be disposed of.<br><br>
I have some questions, and it might be easier to ask them seriatim. First, is the Minister aware that studies by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and several regional councils endorsed by the private sector property professionals suggest that the sale value of surplus office accommodation was grossly overestimated by Touche Ross?<br><br>
Every member of the Committee knows of certain properties that might become surplus. We should ask ourselves whether they would fetch much on the market. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East might have something to say about that because he has specialist knowledge of a certain property, but I shall not discuss it.<br><br>
The private sector property professionals—Ryden Property Consultants' chartered surveyors, represented by Charles Guest—appeared on a BBC programme on 7 January. The Government should take his comments into account.<br><br>
I am told that there is approximately 500,000 sq ft of office accommodation in Strathclyde regional headquarters. Most was built in about 1970. Any interest from developers would be in the site only. The accommodation is obsolete relative to current demand for high-technology offices. Part of the complex comprises listed buildings such as the former high school of Glasgow, which is a potential liability.<br><br>
I have close connections with the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland and with Historic Scotland. There will be considerable difficulty with listed buildings and disposal if the listing is to be kept.<br><br>
Will the Minister say how the proposed residuary body—if there is to be one—will be funded if there are virtually no receipts of significance from the sale of surplus offices? Will a residuary body be funded by the sale of all the non-operational property assets of existing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
authorities, not just office accommodation which would be appropriated, or perhaps confiscated, from the property holdings of district and regional councils? If the Government say no to that, what is the purpose of or the necessity for the creation of a residuary body for property issues when the creation of a property commission would suffice? The Government may have made up their mind and will not have more talk about residuary bodies because they are not going to have them.<br><br>
Secondly, on property costs, what allowance has been made for the costing of fitting out office accommodation to provide computers and other information technology systems which must be provided or transferred to the new authorities?<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
That is mind bogglingly expensive. Until I went into it I had not realised quite how expensive, although I had some inkling from a personal experience. I am informed by Mr. Neil McFarlane, the director of estates for Strathclyde, that recent fitting out costs in Strathclyde have been accurately costed at £10 per sq ft with a similar amount being required for information technology systems. Does the Minister recollect that the COSLA report on property costs states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An overall estimate for Scotland of £100 million has been identified as the amount required to fully locate necessary accommodation within the boundaries of the new unitaries."</p></blockquote>
Assuming that staffing levels within the 20 constituent authorities in Strathclyde—the region and the 19 districts—will remain constant and that most of the staff within the Strathclyde regional headquarters complex will be required to be dispersed to the new authorities, is the Minister aware that outwith Glasgow there is virtually no office accommodation for transferred staff? I am trying to elicit the fact that many employees transferring to the new authorities will have to continue to operate from office accommodation outwith the boundaries of the new authorities for several years until new offices can be built. The result will be inconvenience and additional operational costs.<br><br>
The cost of new-build office accommodation is currently estimated at £80 per sq ft with the fitting out and information technology systems adding £20 per sq ft to that cost. I realise that this is very difficult and I do not want to be unreasonable about having immediate answers to all points, but I should like an immediate answer to the following question. Do the Government challenge those figures of £80 per sq ft with fitting out and information technology adding £20 to that cost? Surely they have some idea of the parameters of cost within which they are supposed to be working.<br><br>
Has consideration been given to the adequacy of the accommodation, both in size and location, available for council chambers, committee and meeting rooms to accommodate all the functions of the new authorities or indeed those of joint committees and boards? I must also ask about the inadequacy of existing district council headquarters to provide a proper public focus and proper accommodation for the new authorities. It cannot be assumed that they will fit in like a glove with new functions to existing buildings.<br><br>
I have also received a representation from Lothian region. It points out that detailed discussions are offered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 601</span>
with local government, but asks which authorities, new or old or COSLA, and at what stage of the programme towards the enactment of the Bill such discussions will take place. This is an important part of the Bill both for the existing authorities and any new single tier authorities. Clarity will ensure smoother transitional arrangements for properties and the staff who work in them.<br><br>
Frankly there is a lack of clarity about the criteria which the Secretary of State will exercise in respect of transfer to a residuary body on a final or short-term basis. On what basis will the residuary body resolve competing interests between authorities on property ownerships? There will certainly be competing interests. In what circumstances will the Secretary of State decide that a residuary body is required? Will it be on the basis of caseload or complexity?<br><br>
The example quoted regarding computing reveals an intention to use that body to provide an operational function which is outside the property related issues as stated in the Bill. That is why I asked the question on the clause 17 stand part debate. Many serious people share the suspicion that the residuary bodies will be operational and will not simply hand out property. I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), both of whom know much about this, assent to the existence of that suspicion. The Government must clear up the matter.<br><br>
The general concept of residuary bodies is that an outside agent can sell surplus properties, act in cases of dispute by direct involvement, or use a property commission if appropriate. Power of transfer of property seems to relate not just to buildings, but to all aspects, such as computer equipment The transfer or use of IT in all councils is now high profile, as is the issue of costs. A presumption is that IT systems are transferable and compatible. That assumption is dangerous. IT systems are not easily transferred and are often not compatible.<br><br>
I have never set out to be a universal expert, but I know something about the matter. It is a minefield. Quite apart from the sheer effort of the staff, trying to make one system compatible with another system with which it is basically incompatible involves all kinds of hidden expenses.<br><br>
Most authorities will understand that they should set up systems to meet their unitary needs. While some databases may be transferable, it is more likely that new IT systems will be required. If new systems are required direct use of converted existing buildings may not be an option. It may not be possible to establish IT systems in many old buildings that were not built in the age of IT. That is an entirely different kettle of fish. Considerable conversion may be required to existing or new property with high IT content and low maintenance costs. That option will be expensive for the new authorities.<br><br>
The financial incentive for existing or new authorities to refer the sale or dispute of property to residuary bodies does not assist Indeed, it can be argued that most authorities can deal more appropriately with disposals.<br><br>
It is clear that a self-financing arrangement is presumed, but from where will the initial start-up funds come when, as is evident from the present recession in the property development sector, capital receipts are not realised? From where will the money come? We established in our second sitting that there is no new money. Therefore,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
the expenses can come from only reduced services or increased council tax. It is one or the other. Does anyone know from where the money for start-ups will come?<br><br>
Will residuary bodies use the current and future estates function of relevant authorities? It is unclear, in the present market projections to 1997, how a surfeit of properties on the market by December 1996—including new towns' properties—can be utilised to maximise resources to new authorities as a result of disposal of those assets. The security, maintenance, insurance and administrative costs of the residuary body will continue until disposal.<br><br>
The experience in England and Wales is of breakdown deals to produce revenue—50 per cent, rentals and values. I beg the Government to examine what has happened in parts of England and Wales. They should perhaps go into a huddle with their English colleagues from Somerset Shropshire, Norfolk and elsewhere where the same problem, in a slightly different form, is developing with old established English county councils.<br><br>
The property commission has the appearance of an estate agency. The functions could be experienced efficiently and effectively by the current and new authorities' estate departments. It is unclear why the provision is in the Bill if its necessity is in doubt. The view of Lothian region is that the commission could be a useful arbiter in dispute cases and, if formed, should deal with Scotland in its entirety. A property commission could operate without a residuary body, given its advisory nature.<br><br>
With reference again to my questions about the residuary bodies, question seven addresses the problems of joint-multi-use properties, which are increasingly the norm in modern local authorities. Who decides? What happens on the vexed question of appeals? Definitions of "Appropriate divided", "Authority of greater need" and
<br><blockquote><p>"Appears to make greater use"</p></blockquote>
raise all kinds of problems.<br><br>
In relation to question nine, the reply was that the usage and economic adjustments comments are relevant but transfer arrangements appear to be highly flexible with, one assumes, the residuary body making the final decision—but again, the criteria appear vague. They appear vague from the Minister's answer in the letter dated 22 January, because he gave a vague response to a germane point That uncertainty in the reply may indicate uncertainty with the question or that the Government simply do not know. Again, I should like comment on question nine, preferably in the Committee.<br><br>
Finally, I asked what contingency provision has been established to allow authorities to reclaim costs.<br><br>
I have made a long speech this morning and I have gabbled it a little. These are difficult issues. When my speech is seen in print the Government and their advisers and, indeed, the local authorities, which are following the proceedings with ever increasing interest may want detailed answers to those specific difficult questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman raised several general issues and that is entirely in order. It might be appropriate if I respond generally at this point in the proceedings. Other members of the Committee may also wish to speak.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned the precedent of what happened last time. You may be interested to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
know, Mr. Martin, that in 1973 the entire discussion of the property commission and the transfer of property clauses lasted for five minutes. Indeed, the transfer of property clause was added to the Bill by Government amendment in Committee. Last time, the initial part of the Bill assumed that property would be transferred by order only.<br><br>
We have had a preliminary discussion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister dismisses the previous discussion as one that lasted for five minutes only, will he accept that it took place in an age before privatisation, compulsory competitive tendering and other Government measures? There is now much more cause for the public to be wary of and to suspect what the Government intend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how that is at all relevant to the subject under discussion. I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman does not have the right to leap up and give us his views. I was simply recording what happened the last time because it has already been referred to in the debate.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
We have already had a preliminary discussion about our proposals for the transfer of authorities. In response to the general points made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, it might be helpful if I take the opportunity to elaborate—not excessively—on how the Government see the critical issue of property transfers being handled. If I put it on the record now, I shall not need to repeat it in later debates.<br><br>
We are fully alert to the fact that in some areas of Scotland there may be the issues of practical complexity to which the hon. Member for Linlithgow referred. Our approach has been geared towards providing a statutory framework that will be sufficiently flexible to allow a wide range of solutions to be adopted in response to differing circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government do not have a policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We deliberately have not come forward with detailed statutory rules governing the transfer of property. I am sure that hon. Members would not have wished us to do so. If we had, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire would have been the first to his feet accusing the Government of trespassing into territory in which it was proper for local authorities to reach solutions.<br><br>
We propose a flexible statutory regime, but we are looking for the major input to come from local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The listening Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his compliment, which I hear is unanimously accepted on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
The basic mechanism for property transfers will be the orders under clause 15. That exactly mirrors the approach
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
adopted in 1975. It provides for considerable flexibility to tackle a wide range of general and specific problems. Obviously, in making such orders, the Secretary of State will consult closely all interested parties. That brings us back to the purpose of the amendment.<br><br>
Beyond that mechanism, we have provided the power in the clause to establish one or more residuary bodies. That power is without commitment The hon. Member for Linlithgow rightly referred to the similar power to establish an advisory property commission. The legislation has been framed to allow for a combination of approaches across Scotland. As the hon. Member for Linlithgow pointed out about Kircudbright and about Wigtown district council, the process of transfer could be acknowledged to be easily and readily manageable.<br><br>
The flexible framework has been drawn up because we recognise that some tricky issues will emerge. The hon. Member for Linlithgow rightly referred to the distribution of regional property across the boundaries of the new councils and to Strathclyde. The general approach, which common sense dictates and, not surprisingly, which has been conveyed to us so far in our discussions with local government, is that as much of the detail of transfer as possible should be left with those with the main expertise and interest. On that, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There is much expertise about property matters in existing authorities.<br><br>
Advice and guidance should be available throughout the transitional period. The hon. Gentleman was right to emphasise that authorities have developed their expertise in property management very considerably since the previous reorganisation in 1975. We have agreed that there are effective organisations to which it is appropriate to assign genuine responsibilities. It is not central Government's role to dictate the details of managing such problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister about the timetable? At what stage will decisions be taken, and by which bodies? When does the process start? Will the shadow authorities put together the first elements of the decisions, and when will the final decisions be made? Will the Minister spend a moment giving a rough timetable for decisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in several areas preliminary discussions with the local authorities have already started. As the hon. Gentleman will know from reading the many submissions that hon. Members have received, many authorities have already expended considerable effort on detailed work on the property requirements for their areas after reorganisation. The hon. Gentleman, for example, will know the work that has been done by West Lothian district council in putting its case, which has now been accepted by the Committee, for a unitary authority for West Lothian. However, we clearly cannot set up residuary bodies until the Bill has received Royal Assent.<br><br>
The key point to make in answering the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which relates precisely to the amendment, is that we are in the business of setting up residuary bodies only with the agreement of the local authorities concerned. We are not committed to them as a matter of principle or central Government diktat. Many areas—I have mentioned the south-west, and Fife and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 605</span>
the Borders might be others—might well not need a residuary body, because the process will be relatively straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a minor point, before anything else is said about West Lothian, I want to point out that the case that the Minister mentioned is very much that of the ruling group on West Lothian district council, which is led by Convenor James McGinley, who is not of the Labour party. As a matter of interest, West Lothian constituency Labour party is wholly in favour of the preservation of Lothian region. The Minister introduced the subject and I just wanted to register the facts.<br><br>
My question about the major issue is: on what time scale will it be decided whether it will be yes or no to residuary boards or yes or no to a property commission? Local authorities that are making preparations should really know what time scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to the first part of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, I do not want to spend time on the complexities of Labour politics in West Lothian.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very wise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley commends my wisdom. I was simply referring to an all-party representation that members of the Committee received. The delegation that I received, led by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), was also an all-party one. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow about the views of the constituency Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston assured me clearly and categorically—and we worked closely together—that he had made it abundantly plain that his preference was Lothian region and that unitary authorities were very much a third best option. He and I were against the absurd notion of putting West Lothian and Midlothian together with a Balerno corridor. While I am on that subject, who ever dreamt up the Balerno corridor? Was it a figment of the imagination of Mr. Alan Young?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Ayr makes his point of order, I point out that we are straying from the amendment and, indeed, the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have covered the point that I was about to make, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the hon. Member for Linlithgow on the subject before, as he will recollect. I do not think that I implied any criticism at all of his hon. Friend the Member for Livingston.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to return to discuss the amendment, but of course I shall give way to the hon. Member for Angus, East as a member of his party has been criticised.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The Minister made two points on which I want to comment. He said that residuary bodies will be set up only with agreement from local authorities. Does that mean that if local authorities do not see the need for them they will not be set up? Secondly, he said that the bodies would exist to provide advice and guidance. Does that mean only advice and guidance and nothing else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question is an unequivocal yes. I shall move on to an explanation of the precise functions of residuary bodies—which will be wider than advice and guidance—but we are not in the business of setting up residuary bodies unless local authorities see them as necessary and desirable.<br><br>
I now turn to another of the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Angus, East. The concept of a residuary body—to which the hon. Member for Linlithgow referred earlier—was invented at the time of the abolition of the Greater London council and the English metropolitan counties. It was perceived as a useful means to allow the swift and efficient transfer of property to the successor authorities. Other tasks often fell naturally to those bodies, including the disposal of surplus assets, management, on an interim basis, of certain local authority functions, and the winding-up of the affairs of the departing authorities.</span></p>
<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>The residuary body, in that model, effectively lifts several burdens from the various authorities that are involved in a restructuring exercise. For that reason—and the hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about this—the practice until now has been for the authorities concerned to fund the bodies in one way or another. However, such bodies have a finite task and a finite life. Hon. Members have asked when they would be set up. The answer is only on local authorities' request and, clearly, not until the Bill receives Royal Assent. We should hope to be given an idea shortly after that about whether residuary authorities are wanted in particular areas.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told the Committee that residuary bodies will be set up only on local authorities' request. In that case can he explain why the Government should resist the amendment, which would provide for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I can tell him the reason. There is a problem about the amendment, which I shall explain, but the purpose of the amendment is no different from the Government's intention. I shall deal specifically with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being helpful in explaining the background to and functions of the residuary bodies. Is all the heritable property that is vested in the existing council transferred to a residuary body and then divested when the residuary body is eventually wound up? Who holds the legal title to the heritage?</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That would not necessarily happen. We envisage the title simply transferring to the new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 607</span>
authorities. We want the concept of residuary bodies in the Bill so that when the local authorities consider that the process is not straightforward, residuary bodies can handle it<br><br>
Residuary bodies are not agents of the Secretary of State, appointed to strip out and realise assets that they regard as surplus. They will have a role in disposing of surplus assets but, it is worth stressing, assets that no successor authority requires. They will also hand over to the successor authorities the receipts from such disposals, subject to their having other resources available to cover their operational costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happens to losses?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A residuary body will have property and assets and will get a positive price for the receipt of those assets. We do not envisage that any property will have a negative price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that specific point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to make a little progress and then I shall give way. The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about savings on property, about the Touche Ross report and about information technology. I refer him to an early reply on information technology when I said that costs of £20 million had been taken into account in the Government's figures. The extra £20 million identified by COSLA referred to improvements in information technology not directly related to the reorganisation. In effect, the figures are similar.<br><br>
The Touche Ross report identified estimated savings of £50 million on disposal of property. There are many estimates on the matter. The key point is that the Government's overall estimates do not take into account such savings from local government reorganisation. They are in the Touche Ross report, but the Government's figures do not include a figure for huge savings from disposal of surplus property. Therefore, any financial gain from those disposals would be an additional bonus, over and above our estimates for local government reorganisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I promised to give way to the hon. Member for the East Lothian.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he does not anticipate negative value from property. Significant costs will be associated with property that remains in the hands of the residuary bodies. We all know from our constituencies of the number of office and other buildings that are empty, often for long periods. Security, insurance and maintenance will be needed Who will pay for all that? Could it not add up to negative costs in some cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, residuary bodies will be largely funded from property receipts. They will also be funded from charges for their services and from constituent councils. It is only right that councils should, if necessary, provide funding because the bodies in question
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 608</span>
will be set up only on the request of a council and will be undertaking local authority functions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question follows the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian. Does the Minister accept that it is the considered opinion of Lothian region that there is indeed a possibility of negative values? It may cost the council to dispose of property. Does the Minister dispute that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly dispute the idea that, overall, there is likely to be negative value from the disposal of property. Most property has a positive value in the marketplace. That is bound to be the case. I would further refer the hon. Member to the rather different view taken by West Lothian district council including, I am fairly certain, the Labour members of that council. It referred specifically to that area and the benefits it perceived local authorities could gain by transferring from the relatively expensive property market of Edinburgh to the somewhat less expensive property market in West Lothian.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Supposing West Lothian district council got its way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have a number of debates on this matter to come and I am anxious to complete my remarks on the amendment. No doubt the Committee will hear from the hon. Gentleman again.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made a specific point The purpose of the amendment is to obtain the agreement of COSLA before setting up a residuary body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not say that</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It says "associations of local authorities". COSLA is not the only association but it springs most readily to mind. It is the one to which I think the hon. Member for Linlithgow specifically referred in moving the amendment which is why I refer to it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Linlithgow did refer to COSLA in his opening remarks and I took exception to that albeit that I accept that there should be some local authority involvement in such residual matters. I should like my hon. Friend to take that on board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do that. My hon. Friend has just confirmed that he listens to every word spoken by every member of the Committee.<br><br>
The amendment could lead to the unacceptable situation where a small number of authorities in an area said that they wanted a residuary body for perfectly good and proper reasons. The Secretary of State would respond positively to that. Under the terms of the amendment however, COSLA could say that it did not agree. It would then be impossible to set up a residuary body despite the fact that the local authorities directly concerned took a contrary view. They wanted it but COSLA did not That is obviously not the aim of the amendment but if it were put to a Division, I would have to ask my hon. Friends to vote against it. I assume that the purpose of the amendment is to obtain a commitment from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
Government that, in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, residuary bodies will be set up only after consultation and agreement with the local authorities involved. Therefore, I confirm that it is the Government's intention to ensure appropriate consultation. We do not wish to establish a residuary body against the express wish of the authorities in the area affected,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to come across as the listening Minister and as a nice guy. It is not altogether convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has convinced me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is easy to do.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow spoke with great knowledge about the costs associated with information technology. He understand that well and I do not, but I am sure that he is right to say that the costs associated with the transfer of property and the development of new systems will be massive.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the fact that there was no residuary body under the previous reorganisation. There was a good reason for that and it is explained in the notes on clauses. I understand why it took only five minutes to debate that issue on the previous occasion. The notes on clauses state:
<br><blockquote><p>"There were no residuary bodies during the 1975 reorganisation of local government in Scotland. For the most part, small councils were aggregated by that reorganisation into larger units. This meant that the new councils had the information to wind up the affairs of their predecessors".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there was no problem.<br><br>
Everything is the other way round now. Instead of aggregating properties and systems, they will be split up. Over the past 20 years, many things have happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recognise that a property commission, if not residuary bodies, was established during the previous reorganisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I suspect that the property commission had much less to do than the new residuary bodies will have because of the grotesquely ill-thought-out nature of this reorganisation.<br><br>
I cite the example that I know best—Lothian regional council. Much has happened in the past 20 years and regional government has developed a range of regional services, involving high technology and high quality equipment. Many of the services provided by Lothian regional council will have to be sub-divided, but, for the most part, they are now carried out in centralised buildings according to centralised structures.<br><br>
The regional assessor and the electoral registration officer are based in Chesser house in Edinburgh. Much complex information technology is involved in their work, which is performed incredibly efficiently. I will never know how they coped with the poll tax, but they built up a system to do so. Presumably, that system will become a common facility for the future Edinburgh, West Lothian and the Mid-East Lothian authorities. Will it be split up and relocated in three different places or will it be a common service? I do not know and the Minister does not know, either.<br><br>
The consumer protection, trading standards and weights and measures department is run centrally in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
Edinburgh. It is run efficiently and the regional officials have been extremely helpful in dealing with my constituency cases. Will that be relocated? Will the existing premises be sold? Will it have to restart and buy new premises in a new authority area?<br><br>
Apart from the central administrative education office of Lothian regional council, there are many community and further education facilities and special schools. We do not have many of them, if any, in East Lothian or Midlothian, but people in my area take advantage of the services provided by further education colleges and special schools in Edinburgh. Will the new authority for East Lothian and Midlothian have a part share in the schools that are currently in Edinburgh, or will those facilities be broken up and sold off and new ones developed in outlying areas? That important question has not been considered.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
What about the existing joint boards? Presumably, there will have to be further subdivisions for the fire and police services. Other major services, such as highways, planning and social work, will be completely disrupted. The rearrangement of property and equipment will incur huge costs.<br><br>
There is one law that Parliament can never amend. I hope that it is not lese-majesty or a breach of privilege to say that sod's law is a fact of life and no Parliament on the planet can repeal it. Sod's law in this case means that property will become surplus to requirements in areas where there is already a surplus of property. The residuary bodies will be left with vacant property, often for a long time, which will require insurance, security and maintenance.<br><br>
The new authorities, however, will have to acquire and develop new buildings and offices in areas where there may be a scarcity of such property. One way or another, I bet you anything, Sir James, that lawyers and estate agents will do very nicely, thank you, out of the reorganisation—they always do—and the poor old taxpayers and those who try to run the services will face considerable difficulties. That adds up to significant costs, in addition to the disruption of valuable services.<br><br>
Could the residuary bodies be established—if not voluntarily, as the Minister suggests, men by arm twisting—to bounce new authorities into the establishment of new joint boards? If it is difficult to get new authorities to agree to the unsatisfactory operation of services from property outside their boundaries, they might be cajoled into joint board arrangements that would diminish the quality of their accountability to local people.<br><br>
To whom do the residuary bodies belong? The proceeds of sales return directly to individual local authorities, but how will they be allocated when several authorities are involved? There will be three new local authorities in Lothian. How will the sale of property in Edinburgh be shared among those three authorities? I foresee many acrimonious arguments about that.<br><br>
When the money comes through and has been shared out, can the authorities spend it, or will it be part of the usual restrictions on local authority capital expenditure? We know how difficult it can be for local authorities to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
spend their money because of Treasury controls. The matter is fraught with difficulties.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow is right to highlight the massive costs that are involved. That underlines again the fact that we are dealing with a hopelessly ill-considered Bill which will cost our people dearly and will disrupt important services on which the most vulnerable people particularly depend. I wish that the Minister would consider the matter more seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as I do not want to delay the Committee's progress.<br><br>
The Minister said that he was not happy with the wording of the amendment. He had problems with the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"associations of local authorities as exist,"</p></blockquote>
which he took as possibly meaning COSLA. If he has problems with the wording, will he agree to table an amendment on Report that would write into the Bill the commitment that he has given not to impose residuary bodies on local councils but to secure their agreement before establishing such bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us assurances regarding a local authority veto over residuary bodies, but the problem of their exact role remains. Will they simply provide advice or guidance? The hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that their role would go beyond that.<br><br>
On the disposal of surplus assets, the Minister said that any proceeds would be handed over as receipts to local authorities after paying expenses. Why that could not have been done directly by the local authorities, I do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why it should not be done directly between the old and new authorities. Residuary bodies will be needed only when local authorities believe them to be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explore some of the concerns about residuary bodies before the matter is decided by the Minister, through orders, in the privacy of his own office. The hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that establishing residuary bodies is an innocuous process which will take place only if the local authorities so wish, but I think that he will concede that a major public interest is at stake. Scottish councils are the largest collective owners of property in the country. Under the Bill, a residuary body may dispose of any land held by it as it wishes, but it shall dispose of land which it does not require to carry out its functions. The questions that then arise are what exactly are its functions and what land does it require to carry them out? Everything else would presumably have to be sold. That is the danger of the proposal.<br><br>
The Minister should understand, even if he does not agree with, the genuine concern that there should not be a sale of the century of public assets which have been created by generations of local government taxpayers, especially if an unaccountable quango is involved. There must be no asset-stripping. The disposal of surplus assets must be the prerogative of the local authorities.<br><br>
There is nothing in the Bill to say what will happen to the proceeds of the disposal. I assume that the decision
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 612</span>
will be made either in an order to establish the new bodies or in a scheme that the Minister will propose for their dissolution. Why were assurances on the proceeds of disposal not in the Bill? If the Minister is to introduce regulations on the matter later, why could he not have included the relevant provisions in the Bill to let us know what he had in mind? The Bill as it stands could give the residuary bodies rights to virtually all local government property. If their function was to transfer only such properties to local authorities as would enable such authorities to carry out their functions, the proceeds of properties sold could be disbursed to central Government.<br><br>
If such properties generate income to local authorities, surely some means of compensating them for their loss of income could be found. Will the Minister confirm that any proceeds will go not to central Government but to local authorities?<br><br>
The precedent for residuary bodies in England is a bad one to follow. They were involved in a massive sell off of public assets. I hope to receive the Minister's absolute guarantee that what happened in England will in no way, shape or form be allowed to happen in Scotland.<br><br>
The Minister says that he wants to be flexible. Will he give an example of the circumstances that he expects will lead to the establishment of residuary bodies?<br><br>
Under the Bill, if property transfers through a residuary body are made to a residuary body, it is that body which will determine whether a property is operational or surplus. There is great concern that such a provision could result in massive power for these unaccountable bodies.<br><br>
Instead of merely giving us general figures, as is his wont, will the Minister tell us who he would wish to appoint to the residual bodies? How many elected representatives would they have?<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify whether a residuary body will be an executive, interventionist body or purely transitory and non-interventionist? That is the heart of the matter. It is a crucial point, as at stake is the property portfolio available to the new authorities and, consequently, the future of in-house property and architects' departments. There will be consequential effects on the expertise and professionalism available to the new system. That is quite apart from the principle that these are public assets, which have been paid for and belong to local communities.<br><br>
Will the Minister outline the membership of the residuary bodies? Who will be appointed to them and why? What local authority representation will there be? Will they be non-interventionist or will they positively intervene in property matters? The answers are crucial to the operation of the new councils. I think that it has been useful to tell the Minister of the widespread concern that exists regarding the powers of residuary bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a legal question? Following on from the remarks of the hon. Member for Angus, East. I am still puzzled as to the legal capacity of residuary bodies. If the heritable titles to properties are not directly vested in the residuary bodies, surely they have no power to sell them on. What will happen if members of the local authority whose property is being sold refuse to sign the feu disposition? I am aware of no power in the Bill that can require them to sign it. If the residuary body does not have the property rights and titles vested in it, it has no power to sell property.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
What powers will residuary bodies have? If I understood the Minister correctly, they can make recommendations. If that is all they can do, it will not assist them greatly in dealing with some of the intractable problems that they will face. If they have the legal powers to dispose of heritable assets, however, they have all the power that they need to resolve difficult disputes. Having looked at the provisions and listened to the Minister, I still do not understand exactly what legal capacity the residuary bodies will have in terms of disposing of heritable assets. It would be helpful to have the Minister's clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Understandably, I am under curfew. Of the 100 questions that could be asked, I shall ask only one. On page 2 of the Minister's letter to me of 22 February, he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"any property which the new authorities request should be transferred to the residuary body rather than to them—possibly on a short-term basis."</p></blockquote>
If the local authority has a derelict property that it cannot get rid of, it could transfer this responsibility to the residuary body. My question is this: what happens if the residuary body cannot dispose of such a property?<br><br>
While the Minister is thinking of his answer, I should like to observe that in relation to what he said about Edinburgh and Linlithgow, if all the functions are transferred to West Lothian, there will be a problem of yet more property in Edinburgh. Given the state of the Edinburgh property market, I wonder how more property will be disposed of.<br><br>
I repeat my question: what happens if the residuary body cannot get rid of derelict, unsatisfactory or, indeed, any other properties?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I shall endeavour to answer some of the questions that hon. Members have to put to me. The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked whether the Government could bring forward an amendment saying that residuary bodies would be created only with the agreement of local authorities. He wanted an amendment to confirm what I have said to the Committee. There is a problem with that. It would clearly require unanimity on the part of local authorities.<br><br>
Let us consider the successor authorities in Strathclyde. There are 12 of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Bill, as amended by the Committee so far, there are 12 successor authorities. If we accepted an amendment as proposed by the hon. Member it could mean that in Strathclyde, 11 councils could want a residuary body but that that could be vetoed, for whatever reason, by a single dissenting council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Eastwood, no doubt</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>:No. I am sure that it would not be the new East Renfrewshire authority—I would not suggest which authority it might be—but clearly, that possibility would exist. The majority of councils could want a residuary body but one council might not want one. I hope that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
hon. Member for Dundee, East will accept the spirit of the assurance that I gave him. I am sure that he will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh dear. The hon. Member is being uncharacteristically churlish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said no with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw that comment then. I see that the hon. Gentleman is wearing a pink shirt today. He is obviously in a cheerful mood.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire returned to the legal title of the property. The primary purpose of a residuary body, in addition to its advisory function, is to sell property. The title to such property would be vested in the body by the use of orders under clause 15.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Angus, East asked me an important question about the receipts of the assets that were disposed of by residuary bodies. I can confirm that clause 18(4) will be used to require any proceeds to be returned to constituent councils. There are no powers for the Government to claw back money. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman that specific assurance on that important point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked me about derelict properties. Clearly, a residuary body would make every effort to dispose of or renovate the property for disposal. If one took it to the absolute conclusion and the property could not be disposed of when it was wound up the residuary body would have to pass it on to the successor council. That would be no different from the situation in which an existing council had a derelict property that was automatically passed on to a successor council when no residuary body was established.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 209, in page 14, line 24, at end insert— <br><blockquote><p>"and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) exercising such functions, with regard to establishing in which council area a person is ordinarily resident for the purposes of section 86 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to clarify how voluntary organisations will be compensated for the costs of reorganisation. Local authorities increasingly rely on the voluntary sector for the delivery of vital community care services, including residential homes, respite care and home helps. Many of the organisations which run those services operate in a particular region. Others, such as Enable or Barnardo's, operate throughout the country. We have all received very good briefings from Enable and Barnardo's.<br><br>
For national organisations, their administrative costs are bound to increase because they will have to negotiate with 28 authorities instead of 12. For the regional charities, the position is even more worrying. At best there will be considerable costs and upheaval as they reorganise to supply services to the new councils. At worst
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
a loss of support from even one of the new councils could cause many of those charities to fold. Members of the Committee know from constituency work that that is no exaggeration and that it is not alarmist. Some charities jolly well could fold if they do not receive the support that they have come to expect from the regions.<br><br>
The bodies providing community care do not have large cash reserves. Any increase in administrative costs has to be funded from somewhere. Will the Government make arrangements to cover those costs during the transitional period? It is not enough to hope that the new councils will sort things out eventually. Even a short term hold-up in financial support would be enough to cause most voluntary organisations to collapse, with disastrous consequences for the people who rely on their services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised an important and fundamental issue. As he and I know, many voluntary organisations often have tight cash flow problems, and any hold-up in cash flow could be damaging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government heard that comment; it is spot on.<br><br>
There is no exaggeration. Bluntly, if I did not feel so strongly about the matter, I should have moved the amendment formally. However, my colleagues and I feel very strongly about voluntary organisations. Urgent clarification is needed, and this probing amendment gives the Government an opportunity to clarify the position. I hope that they will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and to his concerns. I have some difficulty relating what he said to amendment No. 209. As I understand the amendment, it would add to the purposes of a residuary body the purpose of establishing the ordinary residence of persons living in homes in local authority areas that were not themselves those persons' "ordinary residence". I do not understand how that relates to the hon. Gentleman's anxieties about voluntary organisations. However, I can tell him the position in relation to the amendment, as I understand its purpose.<br><br>
Section 86 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 allows a local authority which is providing accommodation or other service to a person who is not ordinarily resident in that local authority area to recoup the cost from the local authority in whose area the person resided prior to entering same. The section refers to the generic term "local authority" so that it can apply equally to existing local authorites and any new authority established by the Bill. Under existing arrangements it is, properly, for local authorities themselves to agree in which council area a person is ordinarily resident.<br><br>
As I understand the amendment's purpose, it suggests that disputes should be referred to a residuary body. That is not sensible or in line with the purpose of residuary bodies. However, I can assure hon. Members that where there is such a dispute, the existing powers allow for the Secretary of State to make a determination. Those powers would continue through and after the process of reorganisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 170, in page 14, leave out lines 37 to 39.—[Mr. <i>Dalyell]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would remove the Secretary of State's powers to require local authorities to contribute towards the cost of operating a residuary body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A very good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that I disagree with the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The amendment covers ground that we have already been over. I pointed out earlier that a residuary body would undertake functions that would otherwise be undertaken by a local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is requiring future local authorities to pay for the cost directly attributable to the moronic reorganisation that he is introducing. Why should the council tax payers of Scotland pay the costs attributable to the reorganisation? Why will not he accept responsibility for what he is doing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be very upset about the technical matter that the Committee is considering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I said is clear: the residuary body will undertake activities that usually would be undertaken by local authorities. Therefore, it is reasonable to require local authorities, if necessary, to contribute towards the cost. They would otherwise be incurring the cost themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will realise that the measure could apply to the voluntary bodies that we discussed earlier. Would not the Secretary of State ensure continuity for expenses that were incurred and required continuing attention? Would not the amendment take away that right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that the amendment's purpose is unacceptable for the reason that I gave and because we do not envisage residuary bodies for the whole of Scotland. I have suggested areas in which they will be unlikely.<br><br>
The amendment suggests that in areas where there are residuary bodies, local authorities should have a free ride, while elsewhere local authorities would perform the same functions and pay for them in the normal way. That is an unreasonable proposition, so I cannot support the amendment</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a revealing morning. It has become clear that the Government will make no decision in the near future about whether there is to be a property commission or a residual body. That speaks volumes about the Bill. People who have thought out proposals would certainly have resolved that issue many moons ago. It shows that we are dealing with the most ill-thought-out piece of legislation that it has ever been my experience to witness in 31 long years in the House.<br><br>
I hesitate to say this, but I do not know how the civil service could have produced a Bill such as this unless, of course, its advice was brushed aside and advice was taken from elsewhere. We shall return to that point in the future.</span></p>

PROPERTY COMMISSION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 15, line 19, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 172, in page 15, line 29, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to make the establishment of a property commission statutory. The two principal resources that local authorities deploy in the discharge of their functions are staff and property, including land, buildings, equipment and cash. Just as it is important to have a staff commission to advise councillors on the transition from existing authorities to new authorities, so it is vital to establish a property commission.<br><br>
Previous reorganisations have shown the vital role that such a commission can play. In particular, property associated with regional functions will have to be disaggregated and the treatment of the issue will require national guidance. For that reason, it is proposed to change the permissive power given to the Secretary of State to establish a property commission to a statutory obligation imposed on him. Will the Minister give us the Government's reaction to that proposal?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are several reasons why the Government wish to keep their options open about whether a property commission will be needed. The position in 1996 will be different from that in 1975. There will be single inheritors in each area, instead of successor councils, as there were on the previous occasion.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Linlithgow said, councils are very much more experienced in property management and they should possess vastly improved registers of their assets. The Government are genuinely anxious to ensure that the best interests of local authorities are served in that aspect of the transition. It is the proper business of the owners of property to determine its use, to decide whether it is surplus to requirements and, if so, to dispose of it. The Government do not want to intervene or to set up a property commission to do that unless that is necessary and until we have consulted local authorities.<br><br>
I agree that there are strong arguments for a property commission. If I were asked to make a forecast, I should say that the Secretary of State is likely to exercise his powers under the clause, but we do not want to be put into the position in which the power is mandatory. Local government might see no need for a commission, but we would be forced to set one up if the provision was mandatory.<br><br>
In the light of that, I hope that the hon. Member for Linlithgow will recognise that the flexibility afforded to the Secretary of State is reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always very suspicious. I am also very suspicious when the Minister is speaking. When he refers to the need for flexibility and for the Committee to trust the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland until the Bill has passed through Committee, I become even more suspicious.<br><br>
Important issues are at stake. I am conscious that the Committee wants to make progress and has considered a number of important clauses and schedules on property today. However, we should not leave this issue until we have dealt directly with the important issues that could face many of the successor authorities.<br><br>
Most of the discussion has referred to land that may be surplus to the new authorities after reorganisation. No one has gone into detail about the type of land and property that is involved. For example, land that is surplus to operational requirements of a successor authority is not unimportant to local authorities. Tayside regional council wrote to me to point out that its surplus land is important in funding capital spending programmes. It estimates that £2 million a year is added to its capital spending programme in capital receipts from the sale of surplus land. It is important to local authorities to be aware that a property commission, a residuary body, the Government or some other body can dispose of their surplus land.<br><br>
Surplus land is important to local authorities, and will be important to the successor authorities. It is, for example, estimated that if even two years' worth of surplus land was sold, the cost to the successor authorities in the Tayside region could be betweeen £6 million and £7 million in terms of their capital spending programme. I have the relevant document from Tayside regional council. It also refers to land held in land banks. All local authorities now have land that has not received approval for the capital spending programme, but which is being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 619</span>
held in reserve for future projects when the money is available. Will that land be declared surplus and be taken from local authorities, thus prejudicing their ability to carry out future projects? Local authorities might well take the view that that land is not surplus, despite having no direct plans for it at present, and .that it must be held in reserve by the local authority. What would the property commission say about that argument? What will happen if a residuary body is set up without the agreement of the local authority? Despite what the Minister says, the Bill will give the Secretary of State power to set up residuary bodies without the agreement of local authorities. The Government have a bad track record for saying one thing, either in this House or outside it, and doing exactly the opposite when circumstances suit them.<br><br>
Commercial property should also be considered. Many councils in Scotland, since middle ages, have been gathering all kinds of property and accommodation, by gift or sale. Such property is often in the centre of cities and is vital to local authorities, both because of the rental income that it provides and because of its bearing on the authorities' powers to carry out city centre renovations. For example, Dundee is now pursuing a policy of putting the heart back into the city. Vital to that policy is the council's retention of ownership of all its property and rent in the city centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not unsympathetic to the line that the hon. Gentleman is pursuing. As he has been considering Dundee, may I ask what he thinks will happen to "Fawlty Towers" when the Tayside region no longer exists? Does he believe that Dundee citizens and the new Dundee council will want to retain that property? Something will have to be done with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For your benefit, Sir James, and that of other Committee members, the "Fawlty Towers" that the hon. Member for Tayside, North mentioned is the headquarters building of Tayside regional council, in Crichton street. It is called Tayside house and was built rapidly at the time of the previous reorganisation to ensure that we, and not Perth and Kinross, would get the headquarters for the new regional council. It has rankled with the hon. Member for Tayside, North ever since. He has resented Tayside house and Dundee because we managed to have the headquarters building in our city, away from his part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is Tayside house as ghastly, as horrible and as empty as the old Department of Trade and Industry building down the road in Victoria street?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note, Sir James, that you called me by the name George—and I always thought that it was easy to distinguish me from my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think Sir James mixed my hon. Friend up with our hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am more similar to him in my views than to my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton.<br><br>
Another category of land that belongs to local authorities is that which is held by their economic development committees. We know from past experience that the Government ordered the Scottish Development Agency to get rid of its entire portfolio—to sell all the land that it held for economic development There is every danger that as a result of the local government reorganisation the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland may be considering the land that local authorities in Scotland hold for economic development and saying to themselves, "That is a nice asset and would make a nice return on the market" They could be planning to engineer the circumstances in which local authorities could be required to get rid of land<br><br>
We want first a guarantee from the Minister that any money from the sale of land as a result of the reorganisation will be redistributed to the successor authorities and that none will go to the Treasury. Secondly, we want reassurance that if that money goes to the local authorities, it will be regarded as additional funding, and not deducted from the capital allocations that they would otherwise have received, through the use of the assets for capital programme funding, which would otherwise have had to come from the Treasury. Thirdly and most importantly, we want the Minister's assurance that there will be no asset-stripping.</span></p>
