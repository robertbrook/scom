</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had merely begun my remarks before we completed our deliberations this morning. I wish to deal with the Minister's remarkable comments, which were dramatic, despite being buried deep in his usual laid-back style. The Minister suggested that a complete change had occurred in the Government's position about locally elected councillors on the water authorities. I say that advisedly. 	<i>The Scotsman</i> today includes an article by Mr. David Scott and Mr. Peter Jones, the local government and political editors. The article, entitled,
	<br><q><p>"Ministers stand firm on water authority plans"</p></q>
states:
	<br><q><p>"But the Government does not intend to move from its plan for members of the boards of the authorities. The members would be directly appointed by Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, with no guaranteed places for councillors, though some are expected to be included in the first tranche of appointments."</p></q>
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) said this morning that the authorities would include a very significant number of local councillors. That is different from the information in the newspapers and from the Government's position until today. One or two individual councillors, plucked from the air, could not be described as "a very significant number of local councillors". When pressed by my hon. Friends, the Minister was more specific about the matter. He said that he would not rule out the possibility of a majority of local councillors on the super-quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That constitutes a change in the Government's attitude. Until now, at best we have heard, sotto voce, that perhaps some councillors will serve on the authorities. In our previous sitting, the Minister said that he would be surprised if some councillors did not serve on the authorities. That position has changed substantially. I ask the Minister, as I have asked myself since 1 o'clock, has the Committee heard a major concession by a Minister who has asked us continually to accept that his word represents Government policy? Have the Government made a significant U-turn and concession because of the strength of our argument and the volume of public opinion, or has a Minister, barracked by the Opposition, slipped up and blundered into making a more deliberate statement than he was authorised to present? I agonised about the answer to that question. The Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries, is an amiable gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A cove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is an amiable old cove, as some might describe him. He has a reputation for occasionally speaking his mind and departing from briefs, unlike some other Ministers. Perhaps he was expressing a personal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1687</span>
view which will be enshrined in 	<i>Hansard.</i> Perhaps it is a case of, "Read my lips. I have said that there will be a very significant number of councillors—and I do not rule out a majority of them—on the authorities". We should not discount the remarks as a blunder by someone who travelled on the overnight sleeper to London and did not read his brief. It would be wrong to accuse the Minister of such a sin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries, says that there will be a "very significant" number of local councillors on the water authorities—and he does not rule out that they will even make up the majority—we must take that as a new declaration of Government policy and a major shift from the pre-existing stance. I am glad that suddenly, perhaps even unconsciously, the Government have recognised the strength of our case. That recognition is not enough, but it is a major advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I was pressing the Minister and listening very carefully to his reply. I agree with my hon. Friend: the Minister seems to have thought carefully about the matter and has concluded that a majority of members on the boards should be—and will be—elected councillors. I do not want to suggest anything that would help the Government, but they would do better to come out and say that explicitly. They should be clear and unequivocal about the matter, instead of making comments that are so thinly veiled. Does not my hon. Friend agree that the Minister would do better to make the position clear beyond peradventure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister has poked his nose out of the closet, but I am not sure whether he is willing to come out into the full light of day, just in case the Secretary of State has not authorised the statement that has been made. After all, the Secretary of State was speaking today at the launch of the Conservative party's already doomed regional election campaign. Who knows what he has said? Presumably, somebody briefed Mr. Scott and Mr. Jones last night about what the Government position would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a bit surprised that the Minister should have listened to this morning's orderly debate, in which Opposition Members advanced some powerful arguments. Indeed, the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) made a couple of unconscious points on the same subject. He agreed that the Government's favoured option was the privatisation of water, and he also agreed that there should be local councillors on the water authorities. Whatever the mixture turns out to be, I believe that the Minister is beginning to understand the strength and depth of feeling throughout Scotland on the matter. The fact that he has made at least a modicum of movement on the hard and fast, arrogant position that the Government have adopted up to now shows that he has recognised that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The movement is insufficient, but at least it is in the right direction. It is the only way in which the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries, can preserve his reputation for integrity. Unfortunately, he belongs to a Department led by a member of the Cabinet who was party to the pledges and commitments given at the previous election, so many of which have been solemnly and openly broken. If the Minister is to protect
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1688</span>
his reputation, there must be movement on this matter. That is crucial. Only when the Government announce that all the members of the new authorities will be elected councillors will people believe what the Minister has said about the Government's unwillingness to privatise water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protestations about privatisation may well respond to a fevered fiction in the minds of Opposition Members, who have good reason to believe the worst of the Government, but people in Scotland, across the whole political spectrum, are not tainted by the subjectivity that may afflict us. If they believe that the Government are to privatise Scotland's water, the Government should be worried and should try to reassure people. They will not achieve that by referring to the consultative document on water and sewerage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr, and other Conservative Members, spoke this morning about scaremongering, but what will the casual, objective bystander think? I have already said, and will repeat, that the document repays careful reading. It is a useful, good and, at times, true document. However, one statistic stands out sharply to anybody who wants to understand the Government's real intentions. That statistic is that the description of the option that the Government have adopted—the three-quango solution for running Scotland's water—accounts for 15 lines in the consultative document while the description of the alternative of privatisation accounts for 218 lines. If there were no other evidence on which to base one's judgment, that statistic would be significant enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. This morning it was pointed out that we had fully discussed privatisation and that we were debating the membership of the new boards for the management of water. Are we now returning to the debate on privatisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point of order could be applied to any stage of our proceedings. However, the hon. Member is right. We are discussing the composition of the boards. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) referred to privatisation en passant. No doubt, he will leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Ayr had been awake a moment ago or this morning, he would have heard me making the clear and frank point that if the Government want to be believed—the Minister—the hon. Member for Dumfries—is outraged that we should dare to question his word on behalf of the Government—the way to achieve that is not by solemn pledges in 	<i>Hansard,</i> but by doing something about the composition of the boards. Therefore, they should consider our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Ayr is worried that his constituents will blame him for something that he has said that the Government have thrown out of the window, he should support our amendments. Amendment No. 676 would remove discretionary powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress so that we can move swiftly to a vote. However, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1689</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was here this morning, but I made it clear that I did not support the amendments. I said that I wished to have local authority members on the boards and I received a fixed assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister on that. The hon. Gentleman would not wish to go against my hon. Friends given the assurance that I sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister said that there would be a significant number of local councillors on the committees. I recognise that that is a significant shift in the Government's position. However, that is not good enough for me, the constituents of the hon. Member for Ayr or the people of Scotland. As with the Committee of the Regions last year, they want the new authorities to be made up only of locally elected councillors from the areas covered by the water authorities. If that happens, the hon. Gentleman will be able to go more safely to his constituents to tell them that, perhaps, the Government, do not intend to privatise the water industry. Without the assurance that the authorities will be made up of councillors as they are now and have been for 150 years, the hon. Gentleman will not persuade his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 676 would delete the part of schedule 7 that gives the Secretary of State the sole power to make appointments to the three super-quangos. It leaves a gap that has already been noticed, but which will be filled on Report. The Secretary of State for Scotland's discretion to appoint, by whatever means he secretly deploys, experts such as water engineers, civil engineers, the business men and the business women will be removed. I commend that amendment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 554 would leave—for the moment at least, before Report—discretion with the Secretary of State for Scotland to choose who will serve on the authorities, but he could choose only from elected local councillors in the areas covered by those authorities. That is clearly not sufficient as yet, but if the Committee sees fit to support that proposal, furtehr amendments will be tabled on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may then be asked to consider amendment No. 681 in the name of the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). That is the Scottish Nationalist option. I do not recommend that the Committee support that amendment. It would enable local authorities to pick people other than elected members of authorities to represent them on the water boards. My hon. Friends and I do not believe that such a principle should be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consideration of the Bill will not finish with the Committee stage. It must be considered on Report and go through the House of Lords. We are not willing to accept the principle that anyone other than the locally elected representatives of the people should serve on these super quangos. Therefore, we do not recommend that the Committee should support amendment No. 681.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments in the group are consequential to these three key amendments, or cover different points. My recommendation to my hon. Friends and to anyone else who is minded to listen to the democratic voice of the people of Scotland—is to support amendments Nos. 676 and 554, but not amendment No. 681.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1690</span>
Hamilton has for some weeks decried quangos and criticised those that exist because they are Tory-packed. According to him, that is inevitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) agrees with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At lunchtime, I checked the membership of two of the major quangos set up by the previous Labour Government. I think that everyone would agree that the Highlands and Islands development board and the Scottish Development Agency were the two major quangos established by the previous Labour Government and appointed by the late Lord Ross.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I have been examining the amendments and the schedule to which they refer, and can find no mention of the Scottish Development Agency in them. Is the Minister out of order in making such a reference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the privilege of being here this morning, but I understand that hon. Members made frequent mention of quangos. Therefore, it is in order for the Minister to respond to some of the anxieties that were expressed then. It follows from the point of order that, from time to time, passing references are made to matters outside the strict confines of the one before the Committee. I am sure that members of the Committee would expect the Minister to respond to any anxieties that were expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members spend a great deal of time discussing the composition of the water authorities. I am simply telling the Committee about the composition of the previous Labour Government's major quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the Scottish Development Agency in 1975 was Sir William Gray, the former Lord Provost of Glasgow. Members included Professor Sir Kenneth Alexander, a well-known supporter of the party, Charles Gray, James Jack—the former General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress—Sir George Sharp, convener of Fife regional council and George Robertson—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Then there are three gentleman about whom I honestly do not know, but I shall give their names. I do not know what party George Wallace supported or to which party Dr. Weir belonged. They were a jolly good group, but I have no idea about their political affiliations. [HON. MEMBERS: "Read them all out."] Lewis Robinson was the chief executive and the last was Alan Devereaux. The majority were well-known Labour supporters—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Member for Hamilton pooh-poohs an old friend such as Sir George Sharp, we must begin to wonder whether Opposition Members can add up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that that quango was packed with Labour supporters should remove much of the Opposition's criticisms of our suggesting a water authority comprising the best and most able people in Scotland, whether men or women, in business, commerce or engineering. Such people could run a water authority extremely well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister recognise that a majority of Labour supporters

on that quango is in line with Labour's support among the electorate, whereas the quangos appointed by the Conservatives are completely at variance with the political views of the electorate? That is what so many people in Scotland find offensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is significant that, in a relatively small body, which may be the typical size of a water authority and which the Opposition have said would be packed with Conservatives, the major quango of the previous Labour Government was packed with socialists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has proved the point. He has surely made the case against quangos. We argued this morning that it is wrong to give the present Secretary of State powers to pack quangos. The Minister complains about the alleged packing of quangos in the past. The case has surely been made for ensuring the democratic accountability of those organisations and for doing away for all time with such an argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what the Conservative party does. We provide a balanced membership. For the only four members of Enterprise Scotland whose party affiliation can be identified, the ratio is two and two. Therefore, the Government are fair in appointing Opposition Members to quangos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) raises a little doubt in my mind. It is all very well to legislate now when we have a fair-minded and up-to-scratch Secretary of State who will appoint to the boards the right people in whom he can have faith. However, if, heaven forbid, there were to be a Labour Secretary of State some time in the distant future, could we be assured that he would not go back to the bad old ways of his predecessors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The hon. Member for Hamilton declared that this morning. He said that not only would he sack the chairman of the water authority, but that he would appoint his supporters in his place. The hon. Gentleman was clear that he would get rid of the chairman of the water authority and its members and, given the way that he has been talking during our past few sittings, appoint a large number of his supporters to make certain that the water authorities would be run in the way that he wished them to be run and not as the Bill provides or the Committee wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put the Minister right? I made a specific reference to the fact that local

authorities—the elected councils of Scotland—would be asked to nominate and that the Secretary of State for Scotland, whether it be me or anyone else in a Labour Government, would appoint those who have been nominated by the local authorities. They may well and probably should include Conservative councillors, if there are any still being elected to local councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an extremely good launch of our local government programmes this morning. There are more Conservative candidates standing than there were Labour candidates at the previous election, which shows that we are up and running and will deal with these issues over the next couple of weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said clearly this morning that I did not think it right to accept any of the Opposition amendments. I listened to the debate with interest and responded to it, but cannot advise my hon. Friends to support any of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said this morning that the number of people on the quangos—between seven and 11—was "not set in stone". Will he explain what he meant by that? Will he change those numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. I shall have to buy the hon. Gentleman a dictionary. What I said was perfectly clear: the numbers are not set in stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members put down amendments to change the numbers, they will be considered. Is not that perfectly clear? If the hon. Gentleman wants the numbers 12 and 15 to be considered, he should table an amendment and we shall give it thought. At the moment I anticipate that there will be about 33 water authority members plus a chief executive for each of the three authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said this morning—I shall not be drawn any further—there will be a significant number of councillors in the 33. There will also be a significant number of men and women—as the hon. Member for Hamilton must have it—from business, commerce and industry who have great experience of running large operations, which is what the water authorities will be. That is the best way to provide the best water service for Scotland. I recommend that my hon. Friends reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reality is that the measure will be accepted unamended. The Committee will reject the amendment by 12 votes to 11. In fact, there will be fewer than 11 votes for my amendment because Labour Members will not give it their support even though I am supporting their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will impose their will against the clearly expressed wishes of the Scottish people, and Scotland will be lumbered with three giant water quangos staffed by between seven and 11 members, as in the Government's plan. The Government's policy will be implemented, leavened with a few quotes in 	<i>Hansard</i> about some councillors perhaps being nominated. However, 	<i>Hansard</i> quotes do not have the force of law. The Minister's apparent concession means nothing.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are about to discuss the more detailed water provisions. Although the amendments look daunting, there is a simple and clear question at their heart. That certainly applies to those in my name; other hon. Members will speak for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the extent of the extraordinary combination of powers of being both chief executive and a full member of the new water authority that the Government will vest in the chief executive. This will put him primus inter pares, with resultant difficulty, especially if the Government light on people with specific, relevant, scientific or engineering experience, because that would enable such a person to control the work of the small committees. The proposal for three water boards comprised of certain persons—one of which would be a chief executive and member, vested with all the powers that the Government suggest—worries me. I am nervous about creating such boards without care, and without a clear idea of what it is we are setting up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A super-quangocrat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A super-quangocrat, as the hon. Member for East Lothian says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious issue to which the Government must have given some consideration. I need persuading that it is necessary to appoint a chief executive who is also a full-blown member of the water authority and that he will not run away with the game as full-time chief executive and member with all the powers that will be vested in him. I do not think that that is necessary. It is important, as I said, to put Chinese walls between the membership of the water authorities and the officials who will serve them. I believe that it is also necessary to put a Chinese wall between the chief executive, who is a servant of the board, and other members, otherwise servants and members will become mixed in a way that would put disproportionate power in the hands of the new chief executives. I and other members of the Committee need an explanation of why the Government felt it necessary to move this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is my duty to try to allay his fears. It is important to point out the implications of the amendments, a significant number of which we are debating with the hon. Gentleman's primary amendment, which relates to the appointment of the chairmen, deputy chairmen and chief executives of the three authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, the chairmen and deputy chairmen would be appointed by the authorities, not by the Secretary of State. It would also provide that the chief executives be appointed by the authorities and, under the proposal in the Liberal Democrat amendment, they would not be members of the authorities, the point that the hon. Gentleman made. Labour amendments would provide that the members be unpaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are essentially consequential on the proposal that, in greater or lesser measure, membership of the authorities be drawn from local councillors. We have dealt in depth with that proposal, and the Committee rejected it. I must therefore ask my colleagues to oppose the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I like to think that the new authorities will be as efficient and effective as any large organisation can conceivably be. One tends to consider organisations in industry. In the majority of industries that are run effectively, the chief executive or perhaps the managing director is also a member of the board. Even so, the board has a chairman senior to the managing director. That, after all, is the current practice in most industries that operate effectively and efficiently. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is underestimating the calibre and quality of board members if he thinks that they will allow the chief executive to run away with the show and run it as a one man band. I do not think that that is possible. In any event, if it was seen to be happening—and I am certain that it would not—the Secretary of State would be close enough at hand to ensure that it did not continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. I might be somewhat more reassured than I have been to date by the Minister's remarks if he could cite specific powers that would enable the Secretary of State to deal with such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman considers the tenor of the Bill it will be apparent to him that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1696</span>
Secretary of State will have significant powers to direct and follow up the work of the authorities. If the Secretary of State were dissatisfied he would be in a strong position to take the appropriate action. As I said before, the quality of the authority would ensure that the chief executive would fulfil its policies and not his own. I should be disappointed, however, if those were not one and the same, because I want harmonious water authorities to proceed positively to their objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speed up discussion to an extent, but I am not rushing the matter. The hon. Gentleman is raising a hare that is not running. We have proposed a fair form of association between the chief executive and the water authority. The hon. Gentleman's amendments would not add to operating efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain unhappy about that approach. The Minister is right in trying to speed up the work of the Committee, and I do not hold that against him. It is in the interests of everyone. The provisions will return and haunt, not him, perhaps, but future Governments if they are implemented as they stand. I am very concerned, but for the sake of making progress I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are simple, and would bring into the public arena the otherwise very secretive discussions of the new super-quangos. We need look no further than the simply pathetic performances, in the public arena, of the present Government-appointed quangos. The attempt to obtain information from health boards, local enterprise companies or other such organisations is a matter of despair, because they appear to have two purposes; first, to protect the backs of their political paymasters in St. Andrew's house and, secondly, to minimise absolutely the amount of relevant information that flows into the public arena.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stage has even been reached at which it is virtually impossible for Members of Parliament, elected councillors or, indeed, members of the public to participate properly in the formal committee business of those organisations or in the flow of information from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1697</span>
them. We want to flag up the fact that local authorities are democratic and open. Unless committees and sub-committees are discussing confidential material, the public are allowed to be involved at every possible opportunity. That is the presumption within local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 595 would ensure that the legislation on admission to meetings is applied to the new super-quangos. The Government may find it difficult to accept that. However, if, as the Government suggest, the authorities remain in the public sector and if they are willing to consult and to be open, the Government should have no problem with the simple points made by the amendments. If the Government refuse such simple and commonsense requests, those organisations will be able to deal behind closed doors with the important business of water and sewerage and—this is our main fear—to start to plot and plan for privatisation after the next election should a miracle happen and the shabby lot on the Government Benches be returned to office. Acceptance of the amendments would strike a blow for democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a bad spectacle to examine the work of local enterprise companies in Scotland. They have been set up as private companies despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of their budgets comes from the public purse. They use "commercial—in confidence" as an excuse to exclude the public from participation and from receiving important information. We have referred previously to local enterprise companies and it is remarkable that people serve on them even though they are not concerned with the basic tenets of democracy—information flow and participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will turn their back on the bad experience of local enterprise companies and health boards. Even though we disapprove fundamentally of the super quangos, I hope that the Government will acknowledge that the public exist. Although the Government have rubbished the fact that 1.2 million people said no to their crazy proposals, they should at least accept that the new authorities will have to be more open than the quangos that have been established in the past two or three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the case for the amendments. My amendment No. 663 is also designed to start us on the path of making the new authorities open and transparent. We have heard much about the Secretary of State's powers to direct and guide the authorities, so he should be able to make it clear to them that they have a duty to be as transparent as they possibly can. Of course, there will be the normal constraints and requirements of confidentiality on the commercial details of some aspects of transactions. For example, one has to be circumspect about the price of properties getting into the public domain so that it does not prejudice the sale or the acquisition of assets. Notwithstanding that, I cannot believe that a degree of confidentiality or secrecy is necessary for any of the meetings or work of the new authorities. Therefore, I have a specific question about what guidance the Government have in mind for the new water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the amendments. I want to know why such immensely powerful quangos should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1698</span>
always meet in secret. Why should they not hold meetings to which the public have access?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decisions of the quangos will affect every person in their area, the wider economy and employment through decisions on industrial and housing expansion, and they will have an immense ripple effect on the economy within their boundaries. Their pricing policies will also affect every citizen. The Minister has told us that they will still be public sector bodies. Therefore, why should the public not have access to the decision-making process, the minutes of meetings and the right to attend meetings? That is normal practice in local government. Why should that not be the case when the quangos are created? The public own, finance and are affected by those bodies so why should people not have access to their minutes and meetings? It is bad enough to find out what goes on behind the closed doors of health boards: I should hate to add another secret organ of government to the panoply created by the Government to run the country. If the Government believe in open government, the amendments should be no problem. After all, the Government have just spent £44,000, plus editorial expenses, on producing a patients charter newspaper. They should find no problem in allowing public access to minutes and meetings. Surely the public should have some input into the water boards and some information about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also provides for the preparation and publication of annual plans. Local authorities have a duty to do that, so why should not the quangos do likewise? That would enable all citizens to know exactly what the quangos have in mind when decisions are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the amendments are reasonable. They are accepted practice in local government. If the Government believe their own words about open government, they should have no problems in accepting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gets terribly upset whenever anyone suggests that what he says about the Government's intention to retain the water authorities in the public sector in the long term is anything less than entirely true. The amendments give him the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that the Government intend that the new bodies will remain public bodies and in the public sector. Many Opposition Members, and people in Scotland, believe that the Government have a hidden agenda and that they intend to structure the new quangos in such a way as to render it easy to transfer them into the private sector. The belief is that it suits the Government to retain scope for secrecy so that the quangos can conduct their business behind closed doors. If the Minister's assurance that the Government intend to keep these bodies in the public sector is serious, he should structure them on the same basis as other public sector authorities from day one. That means that the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 should apply. If he is serious about wanting these bodies to function as public sector bodies in the future, the Minister must accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in amendment No. 663, which would make meetings of the new water boards open to the public, who could then listen to the conduct of business. The Government have already set up quangos in Scotland. They are called NHS

trusts, and there are two in Dundee. One of them, the NHS teaching hospitals trust, which came into being just a year ago, does not admit the public to its meetings. It absolutely refuses to open up its meetings to public participation in the way proposed by amendment No. 663. However, the NHS trust that came into being this month, on 1 April, and which looks after the psychiatric and community services in my area has taken a policy decision to open its meetings to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water boards cannot be allowed to decide individually whether the public can be admitted to the meetings and thus find out what goes on, as is the case with the NHS trusts. The Government should ensure that the public has access to the meetings. If the Minister is serious about open government, and about allowing public access to meetings that affect people directly, he should support the amendments. He should bear in mind that the NHS trusts in Scotland at present are able to decide whether people are allowed access to meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should take account of the arguments advanced by Opposition Members, especially given the stress that he laid this morning on the need to have expertise from the water and sewerage industry involved in the boards. That industry is a relatively limited community. Enormous contracts will be given by some of the organisations. Therefore, it is important that everything is seen to be above board, and that some insiders do not have access to information that is denied to other contractors. The size of the construction contracts could allow those members of the boards from the relevant industries to have a head start on other firms in the bidding. Such behaviour has not been part of Scottish public life to any great extent. Everybody should be seen to have equal access to such information. The best way to do that is to ensure that everything is open and above board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest. I appreciate hon. Members' experience. However, amendment No. 623 would allow public access to at least one meeting each year of the area committees of the customers council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) seems to have lost faith in the local contacts and relationships between area committees and other organisations that are important in the line of communication to the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 54 establishes a code of practice and guidance to ensure that water authorities use best practice in developing their duties. It would be inappropriate for the restructured authorities to be subject to local government legislation, such as the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985. The authorities will be expected to operate commercially. Much of their deliberations and documentation will be commercially sensitive. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) made a point about that. It will be open to each new authority to consider how best to ensure public awareness of its activities and decisions. However, I do not believe that there is merit in subjecting the authorities to the statutory requirements of the 1985 Act. I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1700</span>
already mentioned the points that we have developed in the two Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to repeat points about the Secretary of State's accountability to Parliament in the case of any misuse of power by the water authorities. Commercial confidentiality and running a small board in a streamlined way is not conducive to public attendance at meetings. However, I hope that all local authorities realise that it is best practice, and the hallmark of any good industry, to keep the public well informed about what is going on. The amendment proposes that consultation should be required. That would place an unnecessary burden on the authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it within the water authorities' power to opt to open their meetings to the public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly. That will often prove to be a satisfactory solution. However, I do not want it to be placed in statute. The authorities may have confidential commercial work to discuss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister does not want to place the power to open meetings to the public in statute. However, he has suggested that it will be possible for one water board to admit the public to its meetings when another water board refuses to do that. Why does not the Minister state in the code of practice that, whenever possible, all water boards in Scotland should admit the public to their meetings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to explain that that must be a decision for the water authorities. Only they know if there are commercially confidential items on the agenda. They must decide how they can best fulfil their duties and their business. The hon. Gentleman wants a blanket assurance that I cannot give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point about commercial confidentiality, but he will be aware that under existing local authority rules, direct labour organisations can be run by local authorities in ways that retain commercial confidentiality. The onus is on local authorities to show why a particular item should not be discussed in public view. In this case, the reverse applies. The assumption is that matters will be confidential unless it is decided that they should be open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is particularly unfortunate when the Minister has laid great stress on the need to involve people with expertise in the industry. We are genuinely worried that that will allow inside tracking by people who are, for example, employed by contractors and have knowledge of water and sewerage and who, as board members, will have information to which their commercial competitors will not have access. The Minister must accept that something must be done about that worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could say that the question of inside information from any board or industry is a worry throughout life. Those whom we appoint must declare any interest before they are appointed. I think that we can be confident that they will not act in a way that is out of order, as the hon. Member for Govan suggested. After all, they will be running not a DLO, but a water authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1701</span>
We should give as much power as possible to the authority to run water services efficiently and effectively and not put impediments in its way that might produce discussion at board level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be forced to press the amendment to a Division because we have heard much drivel from the Government in trying to justify the unjustifiable. With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for Dumfries—and I have genuine respect for him—the first comment was that one meeting a year could involve the public. That is not an answer: it is simply pathetic and patronising. Time and again in the Committee we have heard the presumption that the public do not matter. Instead, commercial-in-confidence super-quangos will carve up everything behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Government are truly aware of what has been happening in England and Wales where there is a privatised system. However, in Scotland there will be three super-quangos, still within the public sector and public ownership but acting as though they are preparing for privatisation. Local enterprise companies and private companies will have no access. Health boards and public organisations will have no access. The public will rely on the crumbs distributed from the tables of those organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simply unacceptable to be told, once again, that there will be participation on one day in the year. The Minister will say that it is up to the quangos to allow the public in. However, decisions that are not backed up by firm guidance or statutory provision will result in those organisations excluding the public. No one in their right mind will believe, unless they are truly naive, that the three super-quangos will operate in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is bad for democracy and bad for the participation of the public. I must say—to the annoyance of the Minister, I am sure—that that merely confirms that the proposals are a staging post to privatisation. The Government have introduced the legislation and the paraphernalia of a privatised company, but they are pretending for a while that they are in the public sector and that the public still have some ownership. It is utterly unacceptable for the Government to behave dishonestly with Scottish people and to pretend that the three super-quangos are the end of the journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rejection of amendment No. 595 and the amendments of the hon. Members for Angus, East and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire serves only to confirm that what we have said all along is right. In that case, we want to divide the Committee so that the record shows that the Government do not care about the public and want secret organisations to deal with the most sensitive, sentimental and cherished aspects of daily life—the water and sewerage services. On that basis, I should like to press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with his ranting: he is so far off the rails. I find it incredible that he cannot understand the facts—namely, that we are not privatising the water industry. I have said that again and again, yet up the hon. Gentleman pops, disbelieving every word. That is quite unreasonable behaviour for a Member of Parliament. He never listens to what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1702</span>
What we are proposing is the minimum number: the area committees, customer councils or water authorities could allow the public in at every meeting if they wished. But to do so must not be made a statutory requirement, as they may have confidential issues to discuss. That is important in terms of delivering the best water and sewerage services. Therefore, I reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a genuine inquiry for the Minister. He praises amendment No. 623, which refers to one public meeting of each committee each year. However, unless I have missed something, that seems to refer to the customer councils. If customer councils cannot hold public meetings, it is a pretty sad state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister, address the important issues of the quangos—the water boards—and what public access there will be to their meetings? That is where the real power lies. The public should have a right to know, apart from confidential matters, what is being decided in such meetings. It does not inspire confidence to be told that the customer councils will be forced to hold at least one public meeting a year. I should hope that they would automatically hold all their meetings in public where possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What access will the public have to the minutes of, or information about, the quangos? After all, they have the power and will take the decisions about those public assets which we, as a community, own and of which they have stewardship, presumably at our behest. Why will such quangos not be open to public scrutiny? As far as I am concerned, that is the point of the amendments. Why will all their meetings be held in secrecy? I may have misread the provision, but if not, will the Minister explain why it applies only to the customer councils and not to the quangos?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a start, the hon. Gentleman has misread the provision, which does not apply to the customer councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The area committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is a minimum requirement. As I explained earlier, there is nothing to stop the water authorities, customer councils or area committees meeting frequently in public if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A water authority needs to be run like an efficient business. Therefore, a great deal of commercial confidentiality will be involved in its decisions, which it will have to justify to the public. It will have to produce an annual report and justify its actions to the Secretary of State, the customer councils and the area committees. They will all be breathing down the water authority's neck if it gets things wrong. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that there is no chain of operation to ensure that a water authority fulfils its duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that he has slipped into using the language of commercial industry? He has said to the Committee time and again that the water industry is still a public body and will not be privatised, yet he uses commercial language to describe its activities. He says that there is nothing to stop the quangos meeting in public, but I would prefer the Bill to contain a public safeguard to ensure that they do meet in public and allow

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 664, in page 132, line 3, leave out from "executive" to end of line 4 and insert
	<br><q><p>"or his deputy and by two of their other members".</p></q>
The amendment is fairly self explanatory. I am nervous about leaving the requirments for execution of documents as loose as paragraphs 17(1) proposes. Being a naturally cautious chap, it offends my sense of propriety. Delegating execution to a person authorised to sign a document on the authority's behalf is unnecessary, and leaves too much at risk the possibility of leaving open the door for serious legal document transactions to be authorised by persons who are not members of the water authority. The provision is not necessary and should be excised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with trepidation to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire on account of his experience as a solicitor. I have considered carefully what the hon. Gentleman's amendment proposes. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have. Amendment No. 664 would make more complex the arrangements for the varied execution of a document. All who sign legal documents have, from time to time, been driven to despair because of the number of witnesses who must sign their names, and give their addresses and their dates of birth. They have wondered why all that is ncessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having taken legal advice on the amendment—bearing in mind the need for prudence in the execution of documents—I believe that the Bill's provisions are fully adequate in that regard. I should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman that his fears about the execution of documents are misplaced and that the legal advice that I have received from the draftsmen and others is that the Bill's powers are adequate to cover all issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bowled over by that reassurance and explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1704</span>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point in the schedule that has not yet been discussed, and that is the remuneration of members of the new authorities. The Minister has retained the power to nominate every member of the three new super-quangos. As a matter of public interest, will the Minister tell the Committee what he has in mind under paragraph 9 for the remuneration of members? It is a fair bet that the remuneration will be substantially more than the allowances currently paid to elected local authority members who administer the services so efficiently at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning, the Minister tried to assure the Committee that the new local authorities will be able to ensure that proper attention is given to the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure so that their strategic planning requirements are satisfied. I fail to understand how that can be achieved by the customers council better than by directly elected representatives from the constituent new councils with executive responsibility as part of the new water authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the customers council no doubt will pay attention to the need for investment to ensure that the water and sewerage services comply with regulatory quality and sewage effluent requirements, it will be mindful also of the charges to be levied. The Bill may provide for the customers council to consult with each authority, but there will be a strong inclination to minimise costs by restricting investment for future development. The solution to the dilemma may be to provide in the Bill that each of the new local authorities has direct representation on the new water authorities, thereby ensuring that the strategic aims of the local authorities are met and that there is no unnecessary restriction on housing and commercial development throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the Minister when he says that that is not a major issue. In the light of what has been said, will he consider, before the Bill returns on Report, whether the new authorities should not have a rather different composition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on whether schedule 7 should be agreed to is the last chance to save Scotland's water services as part of the local authority function. It is the last chance to listen to and obey the clearly expressed wishes of the Scottish people on the subject. It is the last chance to dump the proposed behind-closed-doors decision-making process. Democracy, public accountability and the assets of Scottish local tax payers have been well and truly dumped by the past five votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland's water assets will be disposed of behind closed doors by seven to 11 hand-picked people in the three authorities. There is no guaranteed public access to information of any kind, except at the behest of quangos. Since they will be made up of Tory place persons, that information is not likely to be forthcoming. That is an affront to democracy, and today is a very sad day. I cannot express adequately my disgust at the Government's abuse of power. My sincere hope is that the people of Scotland have got the message and that they will say so loudly and clearly at future elections. Schedule 7 will stand as a

landmark of Tory disregard for Scotland and for Scottish public opinion. Whatever the Bill is, it is not democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To respond to the hon. Member for East Lothian, I cannot at this stage give him any sign of what the remuneration for members of the water authorities will be. It is far too early to decide that. We shall give it careful thought in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read carefully what the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) said about the closer relationship required in planning terms between water authorities and local authorities. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, local plans are important. I shall bear in mind the points that he made about commitment. We shall re-examine that between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all that I can reasonably ask for. It is a matter that should be considered again. Once we have started on the road towards a customers council, we cannot claim strongly that the issue is all about unitary authorities. Once again, we shall have a double-tier system. When we begin to lift stones, the creepy-crawly truth in many parts of the Bill gets out. Much of what we are doing is creating the same type of double system to which the Government initially objected, but which some of us think served Scotland extremely well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 632 bears examination. It must make sense to extend the consultation to include the local authorities, for which amendment No. 428 provides. The ideas and the enforcement proposals in new clauses 32 to 37 strengthen the Bill and extend consultation. The Government should give serious consideration to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding to the hon. Gentleman, I wish to commend Government amendments Nos. 492 and 493, and Government new clause 54.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just like that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am just starting and do not want to disappoint the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with procedures for altering the areas of the new water authorities, with the relationship of the new water authorities and the customers council and with arrangements for handling complaints and ensuring that the functions of the new authorities are discharged satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not expect alterations to the three water authority areas to be significant or frequent, but in operational terms they may prove desirable and it is right that the Bill provides that changes could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 632 would introduce a role for local authorities in such a procedure. There has been extensive debate about the postion of local authorities in relation to the new water authorities and there is no need to revisit the debate. For reasons which will be apparent, consultation with the local authorities does not need to be specified in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The customer council will be the body primarily charged with looking after the customer interests. I accept that it should be consulted about changes to water authority areas and should receive notice of any changes, which is why Government amendments Nos. 492 and 493 provide and accomplish what would be provided for under amendments Nos. 399 and 398.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 428 would place the new authorities under a duty to consult the customer council on all matters relevant to customer interests. We intend that the new authorities and the customer council should work closely together and consult about all matters of significance. The customer council has a duty under clause 66 to undertake consultation with the water authority. Implicit in that is a duty on the water authority to respond constructively and reasonably. That will deal adequately with all occasions on which consultation is required. To go further, as the amendment does, would add little in practice to the customers council's ability to represent effectively and vigorously the customer interest. It could, if anything, be interpreted as requiring the authorities to consult the customers council even when it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1713</span>
did not consider it necessary. That would merely overburden the authorities with useless work, which cannot be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 24 to 29 deal with the question of complaints that the customers council cannot satisfactorily resolve, the standards of service of three new authorities and the compensation that will be available to customers when standards are not met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provenance of the new clauses is not hard to find. They come from the legislation that applies to the water companies south of the border, which are, of course, private sector companies. They are not responsible to, or subject to the direction of, the Secretary of State, in the same way as public bodies. The new water authorities in Scotland will be public bodies, as I have often explained. We are not privatising Scottish water and in the circumstances I see no need to import English provisions that were designed specifically for the privatised industry there. If I had done so, the hon. Gentleman would have gone into orbit. At the same time I have sympathy with the aim of ensuring that the water authorities work to specified standards and compensate customers when standards are not met. However, given the public sector status of the authorities, the objectives can be met straightforwardly by new clause 54. It provides for a code of practice dealing with standards of performance and a complaints procedure, including the payment of compensation. It gives the customers council a significant role in approving the code, with provision for reference to the Secretary of State if agreement cannot be reached. The code will be a significant safeguard for the consumer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the issue to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 32 to 37 would impose on the Secretary of State duties to ensure that the water authorities carry out their functions. Again, the provenance is south of the border and the provisions are specially suited to a privatised industry where the Secretary of State has no residual power of control.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two Government amendments are important. Amendment No. 615 would place in a subparagraph a category of person to whose interests the Secretary of State and the new authorities should have regard in exercising their power and duties under the Bill, the Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 or the Water (Scotland) Act 1980. The amendment is required to facilitate Government amendment No. 616.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 616 is important because it brings into action a matter that many Conservative Members have raised. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) will want to speak about it. The amendment will help to ensure that water authorities have special regard to rural areas. It is important that the water authorities give them special prominence and we want rural areas to be considered carefully, especially on the issue of uniform pricing, which will be monitored closely by the customers council. We must all support the requirement for local authorities to consider the special position of rural areas in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a duty to reassure people that freedom of access to the property currently in the hands of local authorities, but which will come under the ownership of the new water authorities, will remain. If they are clear about continuing that freedom, they have it in their power to accept some of the amendments, such as amendment No. 339, as an earnest of intent. I accept that the proposed change is semantic, but it is important because it emphasises rights that people feel that they have at present and which they fear may be prejudiced in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right for the Committee to spend a moment or two rehearsing the arguments and getting some reassurances from the Government on this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister prayed in aid this paragraph during an earlier debate when we expressed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1716</span>
concern about the future of public access to important areas for recreation and for the benefit of people interested in Scotland's environment. Paragraph (c) is unsatisfactory in not giving effective safeguards. It simply requires the new water authorities
	<br><q><p>"to have regard to the desirability of preserving for the public any freedom of access to areas of forest"</p></q>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to the Scottish Office's "Conservation, Access and Recreation—Code of Practice" for water and sewerage authorities and river purification authorities. Page 24 of that document provides examples of good practice, including:
	<br><q><p>"Lothian Regional Council's Planning Department has prepared a conservation/recreation strategy for the authority's reservoirs (published March 1990) to protect and enhance wildlife value, while providing a variety of recreational opportunities, integrated with the primary function of water supply. The working group which developed the strategy comprised representatives of the council, and of wildlife, yachting and angling interests."</p></q>
That is working well. The document also stated:
	<br><q><p>"Borders Regional Council Education Department, in collaboration with Lothian Region's Planning Department, has provided sailing facilities on Whiteadder Reservoir, a large amount of bank fishing also takes place. SNH's predecessors grant-aided information signs and amenity tree planting."</p></q>
That is all highly valued. I should express an interest: my son is a pupil at Berwickshire high school and will attend a session at the Borders region outdoor education centre, which will take advantage of the canoeing training on the reservoir which is currently provided in accordance with the code of practice and is free to the two neighbouring education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to safeguard such use of important assets. I fear that although the new water authorities may have regard to that interest, they may also have to have regard to other countervailing interests. By withdrawing public access and by exploiting the assets as potentially commercially lucrative, the public rights may be lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister is sympathetic to our anxieties. He should go a little further and hold discussions with the water authorities, and ensure that the code of practice is accepted and rigorously applied. England and Wales have a privatised system. Insensitivity has been shown there to public use of

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is some harmony between us on recreation and the use of land and the countryside that is currently owned by local authorities and will be owned in future by the water authorities. When I was Minister for Sport, I often tried to persuade the old water authorities of the importance of reservoirs as recreational facilities for fishing, sailing and so on. Sometimes it took a long time to drive the lesson home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the provision before the recess, I said that I would examine the matter without giving a commitment. Now that I have considered the matter, I shall make a commitment. I shall ensure that we table an amendment to include recreation in the clause, so that it is not overlooked by the water authorities. That assurance, coupled with new clause 42, which was supported by Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Landowners' Association and others who are interested in the countryside, shows our commitment to the scenic beauty and the flora and fauna of the countryside. I hope that the Opposition will accept that we are carrying out their wishes as well as mine. The countryside had been close to my heart for many years.

	<br><q><p>(e) to undertake appropriate consultations with local authorities on any exercise of those powers or functions which may affect, or are relevant to, or may have implications for, the exercise of any function of local authorities within their respective areas".</p></q>
I await with bated breath new clause 42 and the revelations that will unfold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is typical of other amendments that we have tabled. It deals with consultation, which is essential. The three water authorities will be divorced from the practical implementation of policy at new unitary council level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of considerable benefit to know that the regional councils, which are major development agencies in the public and private sectors, are linked to engineering services, which cover water and sewerage. Because of the huge amount of investment, it is crucial that the co-ordination of investment is linked with public and private investment whatever its extent. There is an important need to ensure that early and detailed consultation takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these three super-quangos begin operating in Scotland, there will be a tendency for them, as large bureaucracies, to drift away from some of the practical
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1718</span>
consequences of their actions, especially if they look towards the bottom line in finance. This raises the question of ensuring that their priorities are wholly in line with the developmental priorities of the new unitary councils. That is crucial. Bearing in mind the amount of investment that will be needed to implement policy in the next 10 to 15 years, it is also vital that consultation is extremely close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's content is self evident. I hope that the Government will take on board the important principle that, even if there has to be change, it should not affect the development process locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central, and would like to cite the recent example of a development undertaken by Lothian region water and sewerage authority that was designed in such a way as to enhance access to the foreshore in my constituency. That was achieved because of the close relationship among Lothian council's different departments and the close co-operation with East Lothian district council. It is important to safeguard that type of co-operation for the future. I am talking of the new interceptor sewer that runs along the coast of the Firth of Forth from Port Seton past Prestonpans and Musselburgh into Edinburgh to take sewage from the neighbouring communities into the major sewage treatment works at Seafield, so that it is not discharged into the Firth of Forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interceptor sewer was designed so as to make it possible to form a new walkway across the top and along the coast in Prestonpans. This has been of major benefit to the local community. I suspect that designing it that way may have cost a bit extra. That may not be possible in future if the new water authorities have to undertake major civil engineering works as cheaply as possible, purely for the sake of the management of water and sewerage services. It is important to have that sort of co-operation between the new authorities and neighbouring local authorities to ensure maximum public benefit in the design and execution of major civil engineering works by the new water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian raised an interesting point about the sewage pipe at the back of Prestonpans. I shall keep an eye open for it the next time I am in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central raised the important subject of consultation between the water authorities and local authorities and the Secretary of State, who must, of course, be well informed about what is happening. While the new water and sewerage authorities will be independent of local authorities, there will inevitably be a continuing relationship between them after restructuring takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the new water authorities will continue to be involved in highway drainage. They will have an interest in building control and planning matters and there will obviously be a need for extensive liaison on public health issues. The new local authorities will constitute major customers for the new water authorities and, as such, can expect the same rights and privileges as any other customer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In each of the areas that I have outlined, there will be statutory obligations about which the new authorities will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1719</span>
obviously wish and need to be in contact with the local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it would be wrong to introduce a general duty on the Secretary of State and the new authorities to consult local authorities about everything. Having a blanket consultation would be going too far. I am not sure what we could hope to achieve by writing such a provision into the Bill when so much of the consultation is inevitable because of existing statutory duties and the right of the public to see that the water authorities deliver the best possible sewerage and water services. As we have said before, such delivery will be monitored by the committees and councils, as well as by the authority concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I listened with interest to what was said, it would be going too far to introduce a general duty to consult on everything. I believe that a very reasonable relationship will develop between the new local authorities and the water authorities, especially when they have so much in common in terms of the good of those who live in their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The nature of the amendment is such that I intend to withdraw it. The Minister seems to have accepted that this is a vital issue. In terms of the transition period before the new authorities are established, it is critical that no delays are built into the system because the upheaval will be enormous. That should be borne in mind when it comes to consulting the existing councils and the new single-tier authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='title'>SCOTTISH WATER AND SEWERAGE CUSTOMERS COUNCIL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 603, in page 54, line 30, after "established", insert "before 1st April 1995".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with an important issue—the interests of the consumer. There has been acknowledgement in previous debates about the performance and functioning of the customer council, but this amendment to clause 65 is essentially about the timetable. Further amendments to schedule 9 have been tabled by my hon. Friends, and three or four other clauses complement what is proposed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope sincerely that the customer council will not be needed, on the basis that the Bill will not be enacted. We have said on previous occasions that we think the Bill is half-baked and its proposals crazy. They do nothing for anyone apart from some zealots still lurking in the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to find out from the Government what time scale is involved regarding the customer council. The vesting day for the new authorities will be 1 April 1996. Some important issues have emerged
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1720</span>
relating to the customer council, and I hope that the Minister will address them. We do not have a date for the establishment of this important organisation, which will reflect consumer interests. When will the Minister be able to confirm the date on which it will become operational? If the organisation is to be asked formally to provide advice, guidance and knowledge in relation to the activities of the new water authorities, it must be established at an early date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's commitment to promoting the ideology behind the establishment of the three water authorities is strong, but they are more reluctant to put as much energy and commitment into representing customer interests. They seem more intent on protecting private interests than the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like at this point to compliment the work of the Scottish Consumer Council, which has done a great deal to highlight the issues directly to Government and in briefing the Committee. The Minister has responded positively to some amendments and that has been welcomed by the Scottish Consumer Council. We should give credit to all concerned. We want a general response from the Government about the timetable. If the Scottish Consumer Council and other organisations are to be involved in what is happening, they need a firm commitment on time scale. That is linked to the question of the water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made a point earlier about how highly secretive the new water authorities will be. If the customers council is to oversee such secretive authorities, it is critical that it is given significant powers and strengths and that it is able to access those powers and strengths at the earliest possible opportunity. We do not have customers councils for heatlh boards, health trusts or for local enterprise companies. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) would agree that that might be a good idea in view of those bodies' terrible performance on targets and of the public indiscretions and excesses about which we read daily in the newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the issues surrounding the question of the timetable. We have proposed 1 April 1995, but that is merely a probing suggestion. We would like firm guidance from the Government about their short-term intentions if the three super quangos are established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quite properly raised the issue of the timetable. I give him the undertaking that we shall establish the customers council before 1 April 1996. The new water authorities will come into being some time before then and one of their principal activities will be to make a charges scheme come into effect as soon as they take over responsibility for running the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As any charges scheme requires consideration from the customers council before it comes into effect, it is important that the customers council is in existence to undertake that task. For that reason, we shall ensure that the customers council comes into being at the appropriate date. Although my hon. Friend the Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries, and I have given the amendment careful consideration, I do not believe that there is merit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1721</span>
in a statutory requirement to establish the council a full year prior to the new authorities assuming responsibility for the services. I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for ignoring him during my speech. I was focused on the other Minister, the Member for Dumfries. Did I hear the Minister say 1 April 1996?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that in view of the three months condition for charges the organisation would have to be in being no later than January 1996. Surely the Minister can give us some idea of how quickly the organisation can be established. As he has confirmed, there will be statutory provisions under which the new customers council will consider charges. If there is a transition period in which regional councils, which now set charges, give way to the water authorities, is it not essential that the customers council is in place at the earliest opportunity to ensure that it oversees consumers' interests and, equally important, can deal with controversial issues such as charges?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister at least will write to the Committee and give some indication that he will move more quickly than he has suggested. Clearly, he has kept his options open by saying that the customers council will be established by 1 April 1996, but that is the vesting date for the three new super-quangos. I hope that the Minister will tell hon. Members that the council will be established in 1995, the beginning of which is only some seven or eight months away. The timetable for this and other parts of the Bill is extremely tight, and it appears that there is some worry that it is slipping. The Minister must embrace the sincere point that the customers council should be established very early. Otherwise, there will be doubts about its credibility ahead of the vesting date for the water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about the provision of charges, about which there will be some dialogue and discussion. However, the implications of consumer interests in England and Wales on disconnections, for example, among a whole range of issues, are enormous. The Government will say, rightly, that we do not have disconnections in Scotland at present. It would be safer and much more reassuring for consumers in Scotland if organisations were established with their interests at heart and which they knew would not be subsumed into the interests of the new water authorities, of which we remain very suspicious. The Minister must accept both the timetable and the need for a customers council that will be able to reassure public opinion at what will be a very difficult time—especially as the Opposition will continue to pursue and harass the Government over their commitment to a public sector system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister's response displays a bit more urgency than his earlier comments suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that the new customers council would be established by 1 April 1996, but the new shadow authorities and the new water boards will be established by April or May 1995. In the time between then and 1 April 1996, we can only assume that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1722</span>
the new water boards will set about establishing a charges scheme so that that will be in place when they take over from the original councils. That will enable them to charge people in their areas. Does the Minister mean that the new water boards will be able to put together a charges scheme in the absence of a customers council, which need not be set up until 31 March 1996, the day before the water authorities start charging people? That is not good enough. We need to know that the customers council will be in place when the water boards are drawing up their charges scheme. The customers council must be able to consider the water boards' proposed charges scheme as it is being drawn together in that year. We need some information from the Minister to the effect that the customers council will be set up as soon as the new water boards come into being. We should not have one without the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what he meant when he said that the new charges schemes would be considered by the customers council? Will the customers council be able to veto any charges proposed by the water boards, or will the boards be able to decide on a charges scheme regardless of whether that scheme has the support of the customers council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in what sense will the customers council be independent, as its members will be appointed by the Secretary of State? Even if the staff will have to be approved by the Secretary of State. Will not the customers council be the creature of the Secretary of State, exactly as the water boards are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply to the hon. Gentleman quite briefly. The hon.

We are aiming for a target of around spring or summer of 1995, which we consider would allow a reasonable time to bring that new body into existence. The hon. Gentleman raised the subject of disconnections. He will appreciate that in Scotland it is illegal to disconnect domestic water supply for non-payment of charges. Anybody who studies our proposals will realise that we propose no change in the current arrangements in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East raised the issue of charges schemes. They would have to be agreed by the customers council or, if agreement was not possible, by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has taken a bit more effort than necessary, but we have received an assurance that on or around April 1995 the customers council may emerge. That was our simple request, and as the Government appear to have acceded to it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 279 refers to the membership of the customers council. The numbers of eight to twelve are accepted, but under the amendment those would be nominated by Scottish community councils and each local authority would be allowed to appoint one councillor to the customers council. The customers council would be allowed to appoint one of its members as chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1724</span>
If water boards are a closed system—and the Government clearly have in mind that there should be an extremely closed system of decision-making and that they should be a mystery to the general public until they announce their decisions from on high—it is all the more important that the customers council should be worthy of the name and able to act on consumers' behalf. After all, every man woman and child in Scotland is a consumer of water. Its provision is a monopoly service and an essential daily service. Everyone has a stake in the customers council. Given the nature of the water quangos and their method of appointment by the Secretary of State, the customers council will assume even greater importance as the voice of the ordinary consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An attempt must be made to render the customers council, through its membership, as reflective as possible of public opinion and public needs. I should hope that in forming its membership the net would be spread as widely as feasible and that input by consumers into the customers council should be made as local as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposal that community councils should have a role in making nominations to the customers council, that a member of each local authority should be appointed to it and that it should appoint its own chairman, is an attempt to take back some of the Secretary of State's overweening powers and to permit local input. Some community councils complain that their powers are too limited and that they would like to do more, and more meaningful, work for their communities. If the Government acceded to the amendment, a new and important power would be added to their role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community councils are, after all, in close touch with local opinion throughout Scotland. They would be ideally placed to make recommendations based on such truly local opinions. The addition of councillors to the body speaks for itself. It would add to local responsiveness and accountability. It is obvious that the Government have reduced local councils' role and the input of councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
