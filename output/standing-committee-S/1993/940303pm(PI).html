<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we shall take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 285, in page 20, line 42, leave out 'such explanation as the Secretary of State considers desirable' and insert 'a full and detailed explanation'.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before lunch, I was proving reasonably successfully that the basis for the Government's calculations for the cost of transition was fatally flawed.<br><br>
I used the example of libraries, because Touche Ross, the Government's principal adviser, has made the erroneous assumption that there were 65 library authorities in Scotland and that the number would be reduced to 51. As a result of that, it calculated that savings of 34 to 35 per cent. would be made. In fact, there are only 40 library authorities and the number will increase to 51. Instead of savings of about a third, increased costs will be incurred. The example of libraries alone shows that the Touche Ross calculations are fatally flawed. The calculations of the Government of Scottish Local Authorities are the ones on which we should base our judgement.<br><br>
I know that it is hearsay evidence, but I have heard on good authority that when Touche Ross was challenged about its calculations, the reason that it gave for not getting them right was that it was not paid enough to do the job. The Government got the calculations on the cheap. I was about to say that if one pays peanuts, one gets monkeys, but I do not mean that. However, if one pays a little, one does not get a full-scale, accurate job done.<br><br>
If the calculations for libraries are wrong, the same will apply a fortiori—as well as mutatis mutandis—to all the other calculations for social work, education, highways and a whole range of services. If the Government and then-advisers have got it wrong for libraries, it is reasonable to assume that they have got them wrong for other services.<br><br>
I hope to speak on clause 25 and in some detail about the transitional costs and the payment of them. I want to refer to one aspect of that now, which relates to authorities and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 802</span>
the amendment. Again, I have received information from Archie Gillespie, the director of finance in Strathclyde and one of the most respected holders of such a post in Scotland. His calculations are borne out by the COSLA submission, They calculate that the break-even cost for the creation of new authorities under the Minister's scheme will be met if 22 to 25 new local authorities are set up.<br><br>
In addition to that—I hope that my hon. Friends will listen to this startling figure—they calculate that for every additional new authority created, the extra expenditure will be £6 million. In his amendments the other week, the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) squandered £12 million. No doubt, the Minister will consider proposals for creating other authorities. For every additional authority that he creates, the transitional costs will be £6 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I question the hon. Gentleman's figures. Given the comments made by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) about the forecasts of massive expenditure hikes in the future, we should consider them with forecasts made by other members of the Labour party about the position in England. However, today there were announcements of 2 per cent. increases in council tax. When the hon. Gentleman throws in figures, it undermines what he is saying. I point again to the figures for Cunninghame, which show savings as an independent authority in north Ayrshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned England because my information is that the proposed reorganisation of local government in England is in total chaos. The Government do not know which way to turn. It is doubtful whether orders will be brought before the House. Fights are taking place in every part of England. I understand that even Conservative Members in the Committee are unhappy about the proposals for their areas of England. I hope that we shall later consider in detail what is happening in England because that is a powerful case for abandoning consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about Cunninghame?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. I have also examined the arguments of Kyle and Carrick, Cunninghame and Inverclyde. They are fatally flawed and are a political justification of their independent existence. Their information about regional services is second or third hand. The principal expenditure of the new authorities will be on regional services, education—inevitably the most expensive service—social work, highways and other services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand from the hon. Gentleman that, on Mr. Gillespie's analysis, there would be a break even point at 22 to 25 new authorities and an extra £6 million for each additional authority, so that the present number of 30 would mean an extra £30 million? The hon. Gentleman agrees with the figure of £30 million to £35 million, yet also agrees with the COSLA figure of £700 million. Is not that a rather large gap?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister has understood what I am saying. I am thinking about additional costs, over and above the transitional costs that have already been identified. Let me give some example from Strathclyde. At present, the regional council has six
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0449">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 803</span>
centres for the administration of regional services within Strathclyde. Under the proposals, there will be 12 headquarters for regional services, which means that six new headquarters must be created. The six areas of north Lanarkshire, Strathkelvin and Bearsden, Eastwood, Inverclyde, Kilmarnock and Loudoun and Cunninghame will have to create new headquarters for delivery of regional services. That is why it is an extra cost.<br><br>
If, heaven forbid, the Minister should agree to an amendment—there are some rumours that he might—that there should be three, rather than two, authorities in Lanarkshire, that would exacerbate the problem and add an additional figure to the costs already identified by Strathclyde. Everytime that a decision is made to establish a new authority, the Minister must realise that that is a decision to spend money which will then be cut from the other services that are provided by local authorities, the health boards and the Secretary of State. It all has to be taken out of the Scottish block. The Minister shakes his head, but the Secretary of State confirmed at Question Time, that there will be no increase in the Scottish block. Therefore, the money will be taken from the global figure available for Scotland. If it was not used for those purposes, it could be used for services elsewhere.<br><br>
I hope to discuss some of the transitional costs in more detail when we debate clause 25. I should like to finish by referring to amendment No. 199, which would require reports to Parliament to
<br><blockquote><p>"relate to one authority only."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made this point powerfully and eloquently earlier in the debate.<br><br>
It would be outrageous if any suggestions for reducing expenditure for all the different authorities were brought before Parliament in one order and debated in one and a half hours. The reasons behind the adjustments necessary for one authority may differ from those elsewhere and Parliament may judge one authority differently from the others. Therefore, it is imperative to agree to amendemnt No. 199 so that Parliament can consider and judge each authority's report separately. The reasons and arguments are likely to be different and Parliament might want to judge each authority report differently. It would be intolerable if they were all lumped together.<br><br>
I shall return to the transitional costs later, but I hope that I have said enough to convince the Minister to reconsider the position and accept amendment No. 284. Above all, he must recognise that the financial advice that he receiving is flawed because of the inability of Touche Ross to carry out a detailed and accurate study. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will pay much more attention to the studies undertaken by people at Strathclyde and by COSLA. They know the position—they provide the services. They understand what is required and are in the best position to make a judgment about the costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are taking to themselves a massive power in the clause, so it is important for the Committee to look at it carefully.<br><br>
Finance is at the heart of everything that a local authority does or does not do. The Government already completely control local authorities—they tell them what their powers are and what funding they will have. The Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 804</span>
simply reinforces that control. It is important that, as the new authorities start their work, the Government come clean about their intentions towards local government.<br><br>
Using the clause, the Government will not only control actual local government finance but take total control over guesstimates of local government funding. How much of that relates to actual services remains to be seen, but I guess that the Government's final figure will be linked more to their party-political dogma and their wish to downgrade local authorities as service providers than to the services and the needs in local communities. Unless we are very careful, the losers in the process will be the ordinary folk who rely day in, day out on vital local authority services.<br><br>
The Bill appears to be yet another Government diktat towards the new local authorities. It will follow three years of cuts in Government funding. We must also take into account the costs, not as yet determined—although we know that they will be high—of local government reorganisation, and the Government's admission that there will be no more new money for the system. The result is plain—if it is a case of having less money or the same level of services, something will have to give, and I regret that it will be service provision.<br><br>
The Government's announcement last Monday on local authority finance means that after adjustments for changes in responsibilities, there is an implied fall in real Government supported expenditure—GSE—of 1–7 per cent. in 1994–95, 1·9 per cent. in 1995–96 and 7 per cent. in 1996–97. Those cuts will be inflicted over and above existing Scottish local authorities' drop in finance due to any Government diktat in the clause.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I suspect that when the Government use the powers, more cash will not go to local authorities; it will be ensured that new local authorities have less money to spend on services. The truth is that the new authorities' first budgets in 1996–97 will be unprecedented. There is no like against which to measure like. That is the major problem: the Government will make up the base figure for the budget.<br><br>
The clause gives all financial power to central Government to make any judgment they like with or without consulting the new local authorities. No comparisons are possible. I want the Minister to respond to that. If he makes a comparison, existing budgets would have to be disaggregated, finely analysed and plainly put down in comparison to the new boundaries and authorities that the Government are creating.<br><br>
The Government are not willing to make a comparison. Is there a mechanism and a will on the Government's part to ensure that there will be disaggregation of the present region and district set-up to fit in with the boundaries of the new local authorities? Unless disaggregation is carried out, the Government will have plucked the figure from the air. My plea to the Government is that they make crystal clear what they have in mind as the notional base figure.<br><br>
The notional base figure will determine what the new authorities can and cannot do. It will affect their budgets for years ahead. It will determine the services they can or cannot offer. It will determine the new levels of council tax set by the new authorities. If that is decentralisation as mentioned in the previous clause, it does not sound like decentralisation to me.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0450">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 805</span>
The first budgets will set the baseline and determine service provision. They will not be set by local authorities duly elected for the purpose, but by the Minister and central Government. That is why the notional budget is crucial and potentially unfair to local authorities.<br><br>
What is the notional amount on which the Minister's calculations will be based? Can he give us details? The amount is crucial to all that will follow the reforms. What guestimates will be involved in creating the notional amount? Can he guarantee that the notional base budget will be described in detail? How detailed will be the report that he has to give to Parliament? What information can local authorities and hon. Members expect when the Government announce their notional base budget?<br><br>
I hope that talk of the citizens charter and openness will incline the Minister to make clear the exact basis of the calculation of the notional budget, but I suspect that past practice will mean that it will be kept a closely locked secret. If so, that would be unfortunate for everyone involved.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will deal with the points discussed this morning about the implications of yesterday's European Court of Justice ruling. Will the cost be in terms of millions of pounds or tens of millions of pounds? What estimates does he have, or does he think that there will be no cost? I would be surprised if that were the case.<br><br>
Whatever happens, the very fact of reorganisation will mean greater costs for local government. No new money is being made available to the new system, and that can mean only one thing—service cuts. The Government would rule out an increase in local taxation and, therefore, there is only one route to meet the consequences of the Government's reorganisation and rushed reform—poorer services for the people. I would regret that very much.<br><br>
The Minister should clear what the notional budget will be and what will appear in the report that, under the Bill, he will have to place before Parliament. We are considering real services that will be provided for real people in the new system. The decisions will determine the system's success or failure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has already suggested that amendment No. 284 is acceptable in principle but not as it is presented, for technical reasons.<br><br>
I want to consider the comparisons and consultations. The hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) have drawn attention to the importance of economies of scale and to numbers, respectively. With regard to the making of comparisons, I want to know whether advice will be given based on two beautiful documents that have come into my possession—one pink and one green. They are exactly the same in all respects except colour. They seem to constitute an economy of scale, because, as I understand it, they are designed to eliminate people who, for what ever reason, are deemed unacceptable to the authority. If that is so, there will certainly be a saving, as those people will not need to be interviewed or given any opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is out of order. His remarks are nothing to do with the amendment. I ask him to refrain from mentioning the forms.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 806</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Chair rules that I am out of order, I must be, so I will concentrate on economies of scale, which apparently are in order. Am I right, Mr. Martin?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman proceeds, I will let him know when he is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should expect you, Mr. Martin, to do excactly that. I always know when I am treading on corns. It is fairly clear when one does.<br><br>
It is clear to me that in discussing the question of economies of scale, an important factor is who is addressing that and what examples and samples are used. I accept the Chair's discretion—that is why we have Chairmen, so that we can follow the rules clearly and properly. I am happy, Mr. Martin, for you and others to examine my remarks in detail in <i>Hansard.</i> I hope that the Committee realises that as we are discussing future economies or present practices it seemed to me in order to refer to present practices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that in amendment No. 284 the phrase,
<br><blockquote><p>"following consultations with local authorities"</p></blockquote>
might include or exclude Monklands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was my interpretation of amendment No. 284 and that was why I introduced my remarks by referring to it. As I understand my hon. Friend the Minister's earlier comments, the Government accept it in principle, but there was a question of the wording being technically not quite in order. I am sorry that I was out of order because I intended to say that I hope that we shall examine in detail in considering the amendment, which appears to be acceptable, the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"following consultation with local authorities"</p></blockquote>
The only way that we shall arrive at an interim budget, a transitional budget or a first budget in 1996–97, is by considering what is happening now.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, properly in my view, directed attention to the number of libraries. The hon. Member for Dundee, East, quite properly—he was obviously in order—referred to economies of scale on purchasing. I fondly imagined that purchasing involved an application process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that boy scouts all over the world are looking to him, as world president, to set a good example by accepting a ruling from the Chair?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it quite clear that I have accepted the ruling of the Chair. I have not directly referred to or challenged the ruling of the Chair. Mr. Martin made it quite clear when he stopped me before that he would stop me again if I was out of order. He has not done so, and I conclude that I am in order in drawing attention to what the hon. Member for Dundee, East said in his lengthy comments. All that I am doing for a few minutes is drawing attention to current practices. That is what consultation will be about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with a clause that gives the Government the power to set the budgets of individual authorities. There is much that I would like to say, but I sense that the Committee would like to make rapid progress.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0451">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 807</span>
Amendment No. 285 would provide for a detailed explanation of the criteria on which the Government would set the budget of individual local authorities. The Minister will understand my constituency interest. I want to know how the baseline figures will be set for smaller and larger authorities.<br><br>
Since we began our proceedings, the Bill's centre of gravity has shifted. We started the Bill with proposals for 25 mainland councils with an average population of 200,000, of which 14 would have a population of over 150,000 and 11 of fewer than 150,000. The position has since been reversed and it could be further changed. Schedule 1 contains proposals for 27 authorities, of which only 12 have populations of more than 150,000 and 15 have populations of fewer than that. Indeed, six have populations of under 100,000. I am to meet the Minister on Monday morning to discuss a suggestion that there should be even smaller authorities.<br><br>
The ground rules for the authorities are crucial. As there will be 27 comparatively small authorities, which will not enjoy the benefit of economies of scale, it is likely that they will charge higher council taxes and/or provide a poorer range of services. To give proper consideration to the merits of smaller or larger authorities, it is incumbent on the Minister to explain now to the Committee, the people of Scotland and those campaigning for smaller authorities what the ground rules will be.<br><br>
Will smaller authorities receive a special deal? If so, where will the money come from? If the Minister can give an open answer to those crucial questions, we will be able to assess the issues with the benefit of the information that we require. We can then advise our constituents and local authorities on what is best for them. At present, we are groping in the dark. I hope that the Minister can throw some light on that darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I look forward to meeting the delegation that he will lead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will introduce them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will exercise his right to introduce the delegation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's final comments reflected those of the hon. Member for Hamilton, who accused the Government of introducing two more authorities on the whim of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr as he made his perambulations around the Corridors. That is the most terrible criticism of the hon. Members for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe), on whose behalf the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) spoke so eloquently. The remarks of the hon. Member for Hamilton were also a major criticism of the hon. Members for East Lothian and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), who made a lucid case for change in their area which the Government were pleased to accept. We also accepted the case on Inverclyde made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) and his delegation. I reject the analysis of the hon. Member for Hamilton. It is a pity that he wholly ignored many representations on these matters from long-serving and respected councillors in the Labour party throughout Scotland.<br><br>

The hon. Gentleman also referred to the acquired rights and the collective redundancies directive. His point of order was repeated in his speech. I shall confirm the position because it is relevant to this debate. As the hon. Member for Hamilton recognised, the Advocate General's opinion is not binding. A final judgment still has to be made by the European Court of Justice and the United Kingdom Government await that judgment. I thought that the hon. Gentleman had recognised that, but clearly he has not. I shall reiterate once again—if I say it three or four times, the hon. Memeber for Hamilton will understand—that there is no question of a judgment affecting the cost of reform. Most of the issues have already been incorporated into United Kingdom law through the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. The remaining area of disagreement raised by the Advocate General concerns a technical, procedural matter relating to consultation. It will have no effect—in answer to the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh)—on costs, irrespective of the judgment that the European Court of Justice will reach in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says is interesting, but begs a number of questions. When the Committee debated amendments relating to the transfer of staff the Government resisted Opposition amendments which would have lead to the automatic transfer of staff from the old authorities to the new authorities. I think that they refused to say that they would make that transfer. The amendment was pressed and defeated.<br><br>
The Government are now claiming that they can satisfy European legislation by transferring staff in accordance with European legislation and that it will then be for the new councils to take the necessary rough decisions about dismissing staff. That begs two questions. The Government cannot have it both ways. They are either going to transfer all staff and the debate in Committee on staffing was bogus or they are not going to do that and again face court action in the European Court.<br><br>
Every time the Government sought to dodge European legislation they have found themselves humiliated in the European Court of Justice. Yesterday's judgment was a humiliation because they sought to avoid consultation with the unions. Is not it true that they will face humiliation again because in Scottish local government they are trying to dodge the obligations they took on when they subscribed to the transfer of undertakings regulations, the acquired rights directive and the collective redundancy provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense and I shall endeavour to explain why. As for the Advocate General's decision, it cannot be assumed that successful claims for damages will result if the court takes up his opinion. The opinion does not provide scope for such claims, which some press reports have alleged.<br><br>
I shall return to the hon. Gentleman's point about the TUPE regulations. He has missed the critical point about the directive, which is enshrined in United Kingdom law through those regulations. The directive applies specifically at the point of transfer. In cases where the directive and the TUPE regulations apply, they will have the effect of providing a right of transfer to an individual on his or her existing terms and conditions. Clause 9 makes specific provision for that. That does not guarantee an individual a job in the new organisation to which he has transferred
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0452">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 809</span>
forever, which is what the hon. Gentleman alleged. Specific provisions permits the transferee organisation to make staff redundant, if there is an economic, technical or organisational reason. That is the key point, and it renders the hon. Gentleman's argument and some of his figures entirely invalid.<br><br>
The Labour party's figures for costs, which the hon. Gentleman repeated proudly yesterday after Labour's press conference, are nonsense, for three simple reasons. First, they are based on the COSLA estimate of £720 million, which in turn appears to be based on the assumption that local authorities will make some 3,000 people redundant, pay them £100,000 each, and recruit another 3,000 people—perhaps the same people. With such assumptions, one can reach conclusions just about as daft as saying that Hearts will win the Premier league this year.<br><br>
Secondly, anyone reading the Labour party's press release should read the small print. It makes it clear that the figures assume—as no doubt the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will agree—that all the costs of reform will occur in one year, even assuming the £720 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Read the footnote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have read it and it stated "For illustrative purposes." There was not much about illustrative purposes in the hon. Gentleman's speech, or in the press report. It was pretty small print, but those words were there. I doubt whether they will be highlighted in any press conference.<br><br>
Thirdly, the figures assume that the entire cost of reform will be met by council taxpayers. In other words, Labour's figures completely ignore the fact that 88 per cent. of local government expenditure is supported by aggregate external finance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will finish this point and the hon. Gentleman may then intervene if he wishes. <i>[Interruption.)</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being disingenuous. He knows that the Treasury is not providing an extra penny for re-organisation about what is already in the Scottish Office budget. If any cost is to be grant-aided to the tune of 87 per cent., there is an implication that there will be a bit of extra money from the Treasury, which the Minister knows he will not get. How does he get out of that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is squarely caught. He claims that the entire cost will be met by council taxpayers. But it is clear that 85 per cent. of local authorities' costs will be paid for by the Government. Will he accept that? His hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton gave a figure of 88 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the most important revelation since the Committee began. We now know that the Minister will confirm that the costs of this reorganisation will be grant-aided to the tune of 87 per cent. I hope that that information goes into a press release and is given to COSLA and to local authorities. It is a significant revelation. Does the Minister mean what he said, or is he confused again about the true cost? Is he really saying that 87 per cent. of the cost of reorganisation will be in the form of grant aid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position is perfectly clear.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 810</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Go over it slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend suggests, I shall go over it slowly, but it would be difficult to keep it to words of one syllable, even for the benefit of Opposition Members.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman concede that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has estimated the costs and savings of local government reform and has made clear how those estimates will be financed? Local government costs are generally financed to the extent of 85 per cent., 87 per cent., or 88 per cent. from AEF—aggregate external finance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman. First, his figure of £720 million is fantasy, for the reasons that I have given. Secondly, his figures assume that the cost of reform will occur in one year—a footnote makes that clear. Thirdly, his figures assume that the entire cost of any reorganisation will be borne by the council taxpayer. The Committee would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would read out the footnote on that in his document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very generous. [HON. MEMBERS: "Read it out."] He cannot wriggle off the hook. Is he saying that any costs incurred by the reorganisation will be grant-aided to the tune of 87 per cent.? The Bill refers to £5 million, £25 million and £15 million. The Touche Ross report, which the Government support, refers to £200 million. Is the Minister giving a guarantee that any costs incurred by the reorganisation will be 87 per cent. grant-aided? Can he confirm whether the figure is £720 million or £200 million; or is he attempting to divert attention from the fact that he knows nothing about the costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not dare to read out his own footnotes. He is supposed to have written the document, but he does not dare to read out his own footnotes. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer the question."] I have answered the question clearly. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. All that noise from sedentary positions is not helpful and is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position is entirely clear. The Government have estimated the costs of local government reorganisation and have explained how they will be financed. By contrast, the Labour party has produced, without justification, figures that amount to total scaremongering. Labour Members put their reservations in the small print where no one will read them. When asked to read out the small print, they will not do so. That shows how bogus their figures are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will wish to be fair to COSLA, which states in the introduction to its report:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Report does not set out to define a specific cost for reorganisation".</p></blockquote>
It goes on in that vein.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point about the COSLA report. We have discussed at length some of its figures, such as those on information technology, largely because the hon. Member for Linlithgow has read them in detail.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0453">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 811</span>
It is clear that on the three key points the Labour party's figures are total fiction and scaremongering, as is evident from the fact that the document had to include footnotes which Labour Members will not read out to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to get on, but for the last time I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should all like to get on. I shall read out the footnotes. They are prepared by the House of Commons Library. The one to which the Minister is paying such laboured attention is:
<br><blockquote><p>"(c) Assumes entire cost of reform is met by taxpayers."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is saying that. The cost of reform will be met by the council taxpayers or by taxpayers generally.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The Minister says that we cannot assume that the cost will be paid entirely by the council taxpayer because the Government pay 88 per cent. of the expenditure of local authorities. But he will not say whether the total cost of reform will be paid for by the general taxpayer, through the Treasury, up to the limit of 88 per cent. He consistently refuses to say that, regardless of the knockabout and jumping up and down. We claim that the cost of this wasteful and expensive exercise will be met by the general taxpayer anyway, and he is confirming that. Our footnote should be printed in big block capitals on a leaflet and handed to every Conservative Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is surprising that it was not written in big block capitals in the first place. The hon. Member for Hamilton is wrong. The press release assume that the whole cost will be met by the council taxpayer. That is where all the absurd figures come from, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given way to the hon. Gentleman three times. If he wishes to make a speech he can do so when I sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to get on. The hon. Gentleman can make a speech later if he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if I were to go through the amendments.<br><br>
As I told the hon. Member for Hamilton, I accept the principle of amendment No. 284. I hoped that that would ensure a short debate: that shows my unjustified optimism in such matters. The amendment would place a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to consult local authorities before he prepares a report for the House specifying a notional 1995–96 budget for the new authorities. We have always intended that there will be full consultation with the existing authorities on the construction of the notional budget, which is why I can accept the principle of the amendment. I am advised however, that the parliamentary draftsmen would need to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 812</span>
look at the amendment's detailed wording. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, given that the principle is accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister skated over the problem of the TUPE regulations by saying that there would be no financial problems with it. Does he accept that other problems will be encountered if staff are transferred with exactly the same conditions and salaries into the new system? Even after 20 years of regional and district government, people do the same job at different rates of pay. Those problems have not been ironed out after 20 years. Does not the Minister accept that other problems, apart from financial ones, are inherent in the decision from Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes two points. I do not accept that the decision from Europe, which involves a technicality to do with consultation, creates any problem. The hon. Gentleman's point about complications is correct. That is why we have a staff advisory committee and why the Bill provides for a staff commission.<br><br>
Amendment No. 285 is unnecessary, for two reasons. First, the clause already requires the Secretary of State to explain how the notional budget amounts for 1995–96 have been calculated. Secondly, the report required by the clause must be debated and approved by the House. Therefore, hon. Members will have a full opportunity to question Ministers about the notional amount for each authority. If the explanation in the report of how any amount has been calculated is considered to be inadequate, hon. Members will be able to seek more information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been my experience since coming here that Members have the opportunity to ask the Minister questions. Unfortunately, the Minister is under no obligation to reply in any sensible or meaningful fashion. The House inevitably votes through measures that Conservative Ministers introduce. That is no guarantee whatever. While accepting the Minister's general point, surely the amendment would oblige him to provide explanations rather than flannel?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unnecessary, but I can assure the hon. Member that the Committee's objective is to provide as much information as possible about how the notional budget figures have been calculated. The budgets of the existing authorities will be the basis for that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 199 would require my right hon. Friend to present to the House—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention will allow the Minister to read his official's note properly. What he read out was gibberish. He said that it was the Committee's intention to give the fullest information. I assume that he means that it is the Government's intention to provide information.<br><br>
The Minister then spoke some more nonsense: he said that the Government will have the previous year's budget to compare with the notional budget. They will not have the previous year's budget: that is the point of the clause. The invented notional budget will be based on comparisons with authorities that have disappeared and which bear no relation to the new authorities. The House deserves much more information, not only about the notional budget but about how the Government managed to arrive at it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0454">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 813</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may not have made myself clear to the hon. Gentleman. The Secretary of State will have the budgets of the existing authorities from previous years to assist in calculating the notional budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In consideration of existing budgets, will the Government look at existing practices? If so, the way councils run their authorities, including recruiting, should be taken into account in the budget preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in so far as existing practices relate to budgets, my hon. Friend has a valid point.<br><br>
Amendment No. 199 would require the Secretary of State to present to the House a separate report for each of the new mainland authorities specifying the notional budgets which will be used in deciding whether capping of any of the new authorities in 1996–97 is necessary. In other words, the scope that the Bill provides for notional budgets for two or more authorities to be specified in one report would be removed.<br><br>
The amendment is inappropriate because it would result in 30 different reports. That does not make sense. I accept that that may not be the intention of the amendment, but the consequence is that there would have to be an individual report for each budget. Specific capping action is considered under existing legislation—that may be what the Opposition were aiming at when they drafted the amendment. That would not be inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Government intend to provide the necessary information to Parliament. The Minister could show the Government's good intentions by answering my question about the Touche Ross report on libraries, which was wrong and which undermined the Government's calculation. The basis for all that he has put forward is fatally flawed.<br><br>
Can the Minister answer? He did not answer when I asked him the question previously and is trying to avoid answering when I asked him the question previously and is trying to avoid answering now. I know that the question is embarrassing, but we deserve an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not embarrassing. A number of local authorities which commented on the Touche Ross figures made the point. We amended our estimates in the light of the representations, including those about libraries. I made that clear in an Adjournment debate initiated by the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it true that Touche Ross has been saying that the Government paid little for the report, so what else did they expect? The implication is that if more money had been paid, there would have been a more careful report. If that is true, there has been a deeply frivolous approach to the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no evidence of that.<br><br>
I accept the principle of amendment No. 284. An appropriately worded amendment, which could use the same wording as amendment No 284, will be brought forward; the wording will have to be checked by the draftsmen. I cannot accept the other two amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has conspicuously failed to answer the specific question that I asked him. Do the Government intend to add anything to the base-line budgets of the smallest local authorities to compensate for the obvious loss of economies of scale?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 814</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was helpful in one limited respect: he accepted the principle of the amendment. I look forward to seeing what sort of amendment he produces. His remarks about everything else have left an unsatisfactory situation behind him. The Committee will find it interesting and serious that he would not deal with the important matters that were discussed by my hon. Friends.<br><br>
The Minister failed to say whether the costs of the reorganisation will be met by local taxpayers or by national taxpayers. He failed to say whether the cost will be met by general or by local taxation if it escalates in the way that COSLA and all the experts, including Conservative councillors, claim that it will. Members of the Committee can draw only one conclusion: the Government are in an incoherent mess and taxpayers, one way or another, will pay. I am willing to withdraw the amendment, but urge my hon. Friends to vote for amendment No. 285.<br><br>
The Government are putting forward an impossible proposal. They want notional budgets to be adopted without suggesting how they will be arrived at. We shall vote against on clause stand part.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

The amendment would remove the words

I shall do what I believe to be in the interests of myself and Back Bench-Members by drawing attention to the debates that have taken place in Committee.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, for getting some quiet in Committee.

I also wish to speak as a Back-Bench member of this Committee, Mr. Martin. You have taken me to task on a number of occasions—you have told me to sit down, you have told me that I am out of order. On every occasion I have accepted your ruling. The fact that you are prepared to clamp down on Opposition Members as much as on Government supporters shows the impartial way that you have chaired the Committee. The remarks of the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have crossed swords frequently on various matters. He will know that, as a matter of courtesy, I always discuss with anyone any observations that I am likely to make. That is all that I was doing. It was not me who raised the matter in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel strongly that the hon. Gentleman has made a mistake and I hope that he will not do what he suggested, as it will harm him more than anyone else.<br><br>
I was speaking about costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. You and your co-Chairman have conducted the Committee impeccably. I have fallen foul of you on a number of occasions and you have rightly brought me back to order. You have acted with great impartiality in difficult circumstances. This is a difficult Committee, discussing a highly contentious Bill. I pay tribute to your impartiality, Mr. Martin. Having put that on record from the Opposition Front Bench, I invite the Minister to do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made no criticism of the Chair—I would not dare.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Now that everyone likes the Chairman, may we make progress?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit disruptive to keep getting interrupted by points of order, but none could have been more important. I agree absolutely with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton and the Minister.<br><br>
I was speaking about costs. I shall give a few examples to demonstrate how the Government have greatly underestimated the transition costs and why it is important to consider the amendment carefully.<br><br>
I am again grateful to Strathclyde's finance department for the information that it has produced. The Government need to reconsider their serious underestimate of the costs of acquiring and adapting property. As I said in the debate on clause 24, the new authorities may find that their offices or headquarters are not necessarily in the right location.<br><br>
Let us take as the example of Ayrshire, which will be divided into three authorities. The vast majority of regional council buildings where functions are carried out on behalf of Strathclyde region are in the town of Ayr. If the Government press ahead with their proposal to split the county of Ayrshire into three, the provision of services in east Ayrshire and north Ayrshire will require offices that do not at present exist. The new authorities will have to find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0456">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 817</span>
new offices, while at the same time disposing of the offices in Ayr that they no longer need. Such disposals will incur substantial costs.<br><br>
If there is no market for such property—and the recession means that there is not much demand at present—the offices will be difficult to dispose of. So in addition to the coasts of disposal, authorities will not get the true value of the property. At the same time, they will be trying to find offices in places such as Irvine, where office space is difficult to find, and Kilmarnock, where such offices do not exist. The exercise will cause great problems for the new authorities and will cost much more than has been estimated by the Government.<br><br>
Secondly, the installation of computers is connected with property costs. In some cases property may be needed to house the computerised systems developed by the regional councils. Thirdly, clause 13, which we have already agreed to, allows compensation for diminution of earnings. That will cause substantial additional costs yet, according to the directors of finance of the regions, particularly of Strathclyde region, account has not been taken of that.<br><br>
Then there is the matter of early retiral and redundancies. The Government have made certain assumptions based on the present age of the employees and anticipated wastage rates. However, they have taken no account of two important factors—the mismatch of skills that will occur and problems caused by changes of location. For example, someone currently living and working in Ayr may be offered a job a long way from his present home. He may decide not to take that option but to take early retiral or redundancy. No account has been taken of the cost of such decisions.<br><br>
Has the Minister taken account of the fact that the new authorities may hire consultants to advise them on the transition? I remember, as will my hon. Friend the Minister for Linlithgow, that when the Lothian region transferred from the old authority to the new, PA Management was hired as consultants to advise the new authority. I am not usually a great enthusiast of consultants, but in that case they did a good job. I suspect that consultants will be appointed to help authorities over the transition period, especially as some staff will be in new jobs, some still in their existing jobs and some trying to do old and new jobs simultaneously as the shadow authorities move into place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that a local authority that employs Touche Ross should expect a significantly better return on its investment than the Government received from their first stab at estimating the costs of reorganisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend says. We should also take account of what my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow said—that Touche Ross was not paid a great amount and so was unable to make the necessary study in depth. I believe that consultants will be appointed, but no account has been taken of the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from my hon. Friend's judgment that PA Management did a good job. However, now as then, consultants do not come cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, and they are getting more expensive every day.<br><br>
I shall summarise the additional costs that have not been accounted for—the acquisition and adaptation of property; the installation of computers; excess travel costs;
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 818</span>
compensation for diminution of earnings; the underestimation of early retiral or redundancies; and the hiring of consultants. That is a long list of potential extra expenditure of which no account has been taken.<br><br>
I want to explore a rather sensitive issue with the Minister, and I hope that he will reply. He did not reply to much of what was said in the previous debate and certainly did not reply to much of what I said. I hope that he will answer now. What arrangement have been made to deal with the debtors and creditors of the old authorities? Taking responsibility for chasing debts and paying moneys owed by the old authority will be a substantial job. I want to know particularly about the collection of poll tax debts.<br><br>
We warned the Government that the poll tax would be almost impossible to collect and that huge debts would build up. The council tax is now relatively easy to collect. The director of finance of Strathclyde region tells me that the rate of collection of the council tax is almost as good as it was for the rating system.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the time, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland, drawing his attention to those problems. He wrote back, saying that the poll tax troubles were worth every penny of council tax and income tax spent as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That shows how misguided the Secretary of State was—and is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that no one made it clearer than the head of finance of Strathclyde, Councillor John Mullin, that the poll tax would be difficult to collect. There is a direct connection: the architect of the poll tax was Douglas Mason and I believe that he is still the Minister's researcher—or was until recently—and that he may have had a hand in drawing up clause 25.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go too far astray, Mr. Martin. I could also say some good words about John Mullin. I could also say some interesting things about Douglas Mason, Madsen Pirie and the Minister—the three musketeers, the St. Andrew's mafia, the right-wing influence that perpetrated the poll tax. Another St. Andrew's graduate, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), now Minister of State of the Department of Employment, also played a part.<br><br>
I want to speak about the transitional costs. I understand that £394 million of poll tax in Strathclyde region is uncollected and, presumably, similar amounts are outstanding in other parts of Scotland. Does the Minister expect the new local authorities to collect that money during the next three, four or five years? Collecting it will cost a lost of money. A substantial amount of that debt has already been written off—almost the equivalent of a year's budget for Strathclyde—and is being collected from the council tax payer. Much is still collectable however, and should be collected. I doubt whether the Minister has accounted for that substantial extra expenditure.<br><br>
I have been talking about the underestimates of the cost of transition by the Government and their advisers. I now want to talk about the effects of displacement of resources. Whatever estimate is accepted, whether it is the Government's low estimate, the medium estimate of some local authorities or the higher estimates of Strathclyde and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0457">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 819</span>
COSLA, it is a substantial sum. For example, the Government admit that the transition costs in the year 1995–96 will be £23 million. We heard from the Secretary of State in the House and from the Minister in Committee that those costs have to be met out of the global Scottish Office budget. Those extra costs, whatever the estimate, have to come from another area of expenditure. Will the money come from the education budget? Will there be fewer teachers or community workers? Will the buildings be less well maintained? Savings will have to be made and education has a big budget. Where will that displacement occur? Will the money come from the social work budget—from the vital care of the elderly or young people in care? Perhaps it will be from the new police and fire authorities—taking money from the important provisions for law and order or fire protection. Perhaps it will come from the new water and sewerage departments. We deserve to know. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State should tell us exactly what areas will suffer, because suffer they will.<br><br>
The money will have to be found from somewhere, but it may not be taken from local authority expenditure. Perhaps the Secretary of State will cut health expenditure. Perhaps he will cut the amount of money spent on building roads. He cannot escape the fact that he has to find the money. He has the consent of the Treasury, but we believe that its consent is not necessary. It has already made it clear to the Secretary of State that it will back the reorganisation of local government, but it will not put up the necessary hundreds of millions of pounds extra. The Chancellor has rightly told the Secretary of State for Scotland that if he wants to go ahead, he must pay for it. Of course, it will not be the Secretary of State or the Minister who pays; it will be the ordinary people, particularly the vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point about the Treasury. Does not he realise that the Treasury has accepted the absurd proposals only because the Secretary of State for Scotland has promised to save money not spend it? He has conned the Treasury into thinking that local government reform will save money. Once the Treasury understand that it will cost a huge amount of extra money, the Minister will be in serious trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable interpretation, but there is another way of looking at it. The Treasury is the cutest, cleverest and most wiliest Department in Whitehall. It would be difficult to con the Treasury. It knows exactly what is taking place. It has said to Ministers, "On your head be it." The Treasury knows the flaws and faults in the calculations. It realises that cuts will have to be made. That is why this is such an important debate.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), who has much experience in education, will press for an answer about what educational expenditure will be sacrificed to allow this unwanted, undeeded local reorganisation to go ahead. I hope that my hon. Friends will also ask about social work cuts. We need to explore every detail until the Minister gives an answer. If no guarantees are given, we shall have to press ahead with the amendments, giving the absolute assurance that an incoming Labour Government will ensure that those services are protected. The inevitable harm that will result from the Government's actions will be reversed by the next Labour Government—who cannot come too soon.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 820</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I seek your guidance. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley made a good speech, in which he spoke of costs that would specifically affect Ayr. Would it be in order to refer to costs that specifically affect Monklands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should seek first to catch my eye. If he is out of order, I shall call him to order. It is as simple as that. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make a contribution, we can take it from there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond, Mr. Martin, although other members from both sides of the Committee wish to contribute. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley gave the impression that the clause deals with all the transitional costs of reform. I am not suggesting that he was out of order; clearly he was not. He referred to property costs, information technology equipment, compensation to employees of existing authorities to take early retiral, and the employment of consultants. However, the purpose of clause 25 is much narrower. It is about the method of funding the new authorities—by grant or borrowing or both—between 6 April 1995 and 1 April 1996.<br><br>
The new authorities might wish to engage consultants during that time, but they would have no responsibility to compensate the employees of existing authorities prior to that. The hon. Gentleman will know of the public expenditure provisions for 1995–96, announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said, the Minister's public expenditure plans for 1995–96 contain provision for £23 million to cover the estimated costs of the new authorities during the shadow period. We are assured that that is outwith the local authority settlement. However, some other service developments have obviously had to be curtailed to allow that item to be included within the overall Scottish Office budget limit. Is the Minister prepared to tell the Committee what those lower priority developments were? My hon. Friend has already asked that question. Before the Minister leaves 1995–96, will he answer it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley said that there must be an opportunity cost, and there clearly is. However, the Gentleman's analysis was wholly incompatible with our previous discussion about the Labour party's figures. The Opposition assume that the entire cost in all possible circumstances will be put upon council tax payers. The hon. Member for Linlithgow said that there is a cost within the block and, of course, there is. The £23 million could have been spent elsewhere, but it should be seen against a total expenditure of £14 Billion—the Secretary of State's block as a whole. The Secretary of State simply has to decide on the total priorities against the background of Government-supported local authority expenditure in Scotland, which is about 46 per cent. higher than in England and about 24 per cent. higher than in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may concede that I was arguing that he had underestimated the costs. I also spoke about displacement. He accepted that there have to be cuts of £23 million in other parts of the budget—an already squeezed local authority budget. We debated that in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0458">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 821</span>
Chamber on Monday and hon. Members were concerned about the cuts. Will the Minister answer a specific question? If Strathclyde council and others which know what they are talking about are right in their estimates, the Minister has greatly underestimated the cost and it will be not £23 million but—let us be generous—£43 million. How will the extra £20 million be funded? Will it all come out of the council tax, or will the Minister make funds available?</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made clear, as has my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, what the total public expenditure provision will be. A cost of £23 million does not necessarily mean cuts elsewhere, it could mean reductions in increases elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The level of public expenditure is by any standards extremely high in relation to need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that the Minister's calculation is wrong and that that of the local authorities is right. For the sake of argument, let us say that the real cost is not £23 million but £43 million. How will the extra £20 million be funded—will it have to be funded through a council tax increase or will the Minister make 85 per cent. grant available and find extra £20 million somewhere else, such as the Scottish Office block grant, for example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to answer hypothetical questions such as, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" The public expenditure totals have been announced by my hon. Friend the Secretary of State. As the hon. Gentleman knows, they are revised from year to year. Although the £23 million could be spent elsewhere, there will be subsequent savings and it is a relatively small proportion of the total expenditure of £14,000,000 million.<br><br>
I said that the clause is limited. The effect of amendment No. 286 would be to oblige the Secretary of State to fund shadow authorities by grants, and therefore to preclude the option of borrowing provided by the clause. The amendment would remove the conventional role of the Treasury. It is sensible to give the Secretary of State discretion to determine whether the shadow authorities should be funded by grant, borrowing or a combination of the two. It is normal for the Secretary of State's consent to be required—there is nothing unusual about that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 287 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to pay grant to cover whatever amount local authorities decided to spend during their shadow period. That is a licence for local authorities to print money, a blank cheque—there would be no limit to their potential expenditure. No sensible Government would agree to that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 318 would entirely remove Government control over borrowing undertaken by the new authorities to meet their expenses. That is also unacceptable. Whatever funding option the Secretary of State decides on—grant, borrowing or a combination of the two—the amount involved will count as public expenditure and will have to be provided for in public expenditure plans. It is therefore essential that authorities require the consent of the Secretary of State to any borrowing, and that he in turn should require the consent of the Treasury in the normal way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 822</span>
I cannot accept the amendments, but I emphasise that the clause does not propose anything unusual concerning the powers of the Secretory of State, the Treasury and local authorities over expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause allows the Secretary of State to make grants to the shadow authorities.
<br><blockquote><p>"of such amounts, and subject to such conditions…as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
It also allows the authorities, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State, to borrow temporarily to cover any expenditure beyond the level of any grants received. I say that because people may want to know the background.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's public expenditure plans, announced in December and confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Planning, contain provisions—outwith the local government settlement—for £23 million in 1996–96, to cover the estimated costs for the new authorities during the shadow period, The increase in the number of authorities should lead to an increase in that cost—I do not know whether the Government dispute that. Presumably, the Secretary of State will make the grants identified in the clause from that provision. The borrowing powers could allow the shadow authorities to spend beyond the level of grant received, but the overspend will have to be funded by increased council tax bills in 1996–97. The fact that such borrowing requires the consent of the Secretary of State means that, if he wishes, he can cap the expenditure levels of the shadow authorities.<br><br>
The COSLA report on costs suggests that the cost of preparing for change could be as much as £75 million.lt makes it clear that some of those costs would be met by the current authorities, prior to the shadow authorities being formed. Surely the larger share would fall on the shadow authorities? The highest possible level of resources must be put into the planning process up to March 1996 to ensure the efficient transfer of resources to the new authorities. It is qually important that adequate cover is provided for staff engaged in that work or there will be consequences for current delivery service—not just for on-going delivery but also for planned development, such as community care. Failure to fund both elements fully could reduce the cost in cash terms, but there would be a cost in terms of service delivery.<br><br>
The Committee will be relieved to hear that that brings me to only four main questions. Now that the number of authorities has been increased to 30, will the Minister advise the Committee of his revised estimate of the cost of the shadow authorities? Will the Minister provide full details of his calculation of the cost to the shadow authorities? Will the Minister say how the cost will be allocated among individual authorities. Will the Minister state whether the Secretary of State intends to use his borrowing consent powers to cap the expenditure levels of the shadow authorities? If so, will he say how and when the cap levels might be determined?<br><br>
It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister for a detailed response to those questions. Mr. Ken McKay is present and presumably knows that such questions have been thought out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be called to speak. Much good sense has been spoken today—obviously, I had to stand in line. Unfortunately the Minister did not allow me

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 823</span>
to intervene a few times. I should like him to respond to my points some time. I know that he is keen to make progress and so am I.<br><br>
The purpose of the clause is to ensure that a realistic budget framework is given to the transitional authorities. Amendment No. 287 is important: it concerns providing "sufficient money". The Minister said that he saw that as a blank cheque. We expressed the amendment in such terms because we do not trust the Secretary of State to get the figures right. We have much evidence which I hope to lay before him to persuade him to accept the amendment. The word "sufficient" is important, because he had not got matters right. People are asked to trust the Minister's statements in Committee, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Govan said, using the Glaswegian term, they often turn out to be so much flannel. I do not know the origins of the term, but it has come to express—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is to do with knickers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As someone who does not usually give in to that sort of thing, I shall not pursue that remark, but I am sure that the Minister knows the meaning of terms such as flannel, hot air and so on.<br><br>
The problem is that we do not trust the Minister to get it right—not that if he did get it right, we would not trust him to do the honest thing and fund the authorities properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Roberston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to that. The Minister had difficult earlier in explaining to us where he would get the money to cover those costs. It will not necessarily come from the council taxpayer or the Treasury. He must worry that Treasury officials will read the reports of Committee proceedings and realise that he has been making promises that they are not willing to fulfil.<br><br>
One possibility would be to raise the money by charging people for services that they currently get for their council tax. They could end up paying national taxes at the exorbitant rates that the Government will levy from April 1994, and also paying for individual services. For example, if one's child had a learning difficulty, one could consult an educational psychologist by paying council tax plus a specified charge. That is a realistic scenario in some of the councils about which we have heard today.<br><br>
We know that councils will be under-resourced and that they will not have sufficient money to pay for services. They will have to abandon those services unless they can raise the money by increasing council tax, getting it from the Government—we know that there is no chance of that—or collecting it from the people who need the individual services.<br><br>
Such a scenario is represented by Stirling district council's recent announcement that leisure service charges would rise by 200 to 300 per cent. It could also apply to children's psychological and educational needs. We might return to a situation in which children would have to take their own books to school, if they could afford them. Everything is possible given the Minister's inadequate reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central.<br><br>
The Minister and the previous Secretary of State said that capping powers would be used because only 37 per cent. of the population paid rates. They discounted the idea that rates were paid by a family as a household charge.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 824</span>
According to their explanation, we needed capping then to stop councils spending on services which people would not know that they were paying for, because not everyone was paying. Authorities had to be capped because of their excessive and unreasonable expenditure.<br><br>
It is interesting that when the Government first capped Stirling district council, of which I was leader, we put our rates up by a substantial amount to raise enough funds. At the first election thereafter, the number of Labour councillors increased from 10 out of 20 to 11 out of 20, and the number of Conservative councillors fell by one. As the Government's measure did not have the effect that they had anticipated, they introduced the poll tax, so that each individual would know that he was paying and would therefore be able to constrain the council and guide it, by means of the ballot box.<br><br>
I have letters from the then Secretary of State for Scotland, now the Secretary of State for Defence, stating that when the Government introduced the poll tax, they would not need to cap councils because everyone would be paying and would decide whether the council was acting correctly or not. People would be able to vote the council out if they did not like the way that it was spending the money that they had paid individually. When that did not happen, and people stood by the councils and the services that they were delivering, the Government imposed capping even on the poll tax, denying everything that they had said before and trying to restrain local government by voting themselves a majority on the council.<br><br>
We now have council tax, and the Government admit that household payments are acceptable, but we still have capping, and there will be capping in advance of the reorganisation. That is the problem with the Government's proposal, and why it is important for the clause to state that they "will provide sufficient money".<br><br>
If I had found that the calculations that the Government have put before the nation and the House of Commons until Second Reading and to the Committee were beginning to show realistic assessments of what councils will have to spend, I might agree that the amendment was unnecessary. Research Paper 93/75 published in July 1993 puts the matter succinctly. What Touche Ross said about the cost of the councils was greatly at variance with further analysis. Touche Ross estimated the costs and savings of different numbers of councils. The present proposal is nearest to the 35-council scenario, although the number is creeping upward.<br><br>
Touche Ross said that with 35 councils there would be savings of £55 million. Strathclyde council's analysis found that there would be an additional cost of £78.2 million. Those figures are in table 5 of page 30 of the paper. On page 31, the Touche Ross estimate again stands at £55 million. Strathclyde went away and reworked its figures, having brought in the expertise about which we have heard today—several of the officials and senior councillors have been mentioned. It estimated the net cost of a 35-council scenario to be £68 million. The Touche Ross figure has now been much devalued by further analysis.<br><br>
The Scottish Society of Directors of Planning also did an analysis that is probably the approach most sympathetic to the Government. For the 35-council model, which is near to what is currently proposed, it estimated an £11 million loss or extra cost to local authorities. No one believes that the Government or those that they hire are able to calculate the real cost to local authorities of the proposals. That is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0460">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 825</span>
why we require an amendment that says that the Government must "provide sufficient money"—we all suspect that they will provide much less than is required and that councils will have to cut services, or add the cost to their council tax or to charges that people have to pay for individual and vital services.<br><br>
The COSLA analysis submitted to the Committee is a thorough document setting out all of the arguments concerning why the Touche Ross approach was wrong and why the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy analysis for COSLA was much nearer the mark. The revised estimate in part III of that report is important. It estimates staff costs, for example, at between £230 million and £410 million for all Scottish local authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow has returned again and again to the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley about property. The report estimates property costs at between £25 million and £100 million. Information technology costs are estimated at £40 million. The costs of preparation for change and of winding-up councils are estimated at between £80 million and £170 million. The Government have allowed only £23 million for that.<br><br>
The estimate for the total cost ranges between £375 million and £720 million. When that range of figures is compared with the top end of the Touche Ross range—£196 million—we can see a huge disparity and we can see why we need the clause to state that the Government must include "sufficient money", rather than allow them to put in what the Secretary of State considers appropriate.<br><br>
The Government are asking—and if we do not object, we too are asking—the people who will be trying to run local government in the transitional phase to take whatever the Secretry of State hands out to them with the support of the Minister, regardless of whether it pays for the work that is necessary.<br><br>
I heard mention of what will be—if it disappears—the former Monklands district council, which is to be subsumed into North Lanarkshire. I wanted to examine one of the estimates of costs for that area. However, I looked more closely at the study with which the Minister is now familiar—at least, he probably knows its, name, if not the data—the Pieda report for Central regional council. At the meeting, the Minister said that he saw it as a serious study, which he had read and which had made an impact on him.<br><br>
I have referred to these figures before, but the Minister will not mind me repeating them. In the estimates relating to transitional matters, the number of staff required in what the study, at page 9, calls option two and option three—the two-council model, whether a Falkirk-Clackmannan model or a Stirling-Clackmannan model with Falkirk standing alone—is estimated at two more. That is a neutral budget which does not save the money that the Government want to save. The Government may say, "Central is not the place where we will save. We will save somewhere else". I do not think that that is likely, because disaggregating regional council functions will cost the money—it will not bring savings.<br><br>
The estimate in the Pieda report is for transitional costs of £8.6 million for a unitary authority, because there will be some transitional costs, but there will not be savings if we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
do not move to a unitary authority. With two unitary authorities rather than one, there will still be costs of £6.661 million. There will be costs either way.<br><br>
If the Minister is talking about savings it is worth putting on record that 210 more people will be required should he be tempted to adopt a three unitary authority structure—a Stirling-Clackmannan-Falkirk unitary structure or some such thing. That would load on an additional annual cost of £5.2 million for a three council solution.<br><br>
That analysis comes from an organisation that works for Central region. Perhaps there is another view—from a council that wants to stand alone as a unitary authority. I sought out the figures for Falkirk. Falkirk district would like to be a unitary authority. It has made that plain to me and has written to the Minister. Its representatives have not yet asked for a meeting with the Minister, but when they do I shall be happy to facilitate that if the Minister is willing. It is important not just to accept Pieda because I think that its logic is rigorous. Perhaps it would not make sense if someone else applied a different logic. The appendix of Falkirk district council's report, "The Way Forward: A Case for Falkirk District as a Unitary Authority" was about staffing and was very interesting.<br><br>
Page 3 of that report shows that Falkirk calculated, with regard to district and regional staff who currently work in Falkirk district, that 7,236 staff would be required if it was decided to take on the joint arrangements that would be forced upon it because of joint boards of some kind. That would be a net figure of 6,338 staff in Falkirk. However, one would have expected that council to say, "We can do it cheaper. We can do it with fewer staff" in a bid to convince the Minister. I commend it for its honesty in having given the figures that would be needed to run the system realistically. It estimates that, including the joint arrangement—not disaggregated—it would require 7,238 staff as opposed to 7,236. That is the same as Central region's Pieda study. It requires two more staff to run the functions in that area. The disaggregated figure is 6,339, which is one more than the figure for the services in Falkirk district.<br><br>
When two authorities—a regional authority wanting to remain a unitary authority, and a district authority—bid for unitary status from different points of view and produce such similar figures, they must be credible. Those figures say the same thing. That shows that the Minister's estimates of savings are wrong. If he can get those figures so wrong, we have serious problems believing that he will allow an adequate sum. He will give whatever he considers appropriate. Amendment No. 287 is necessary because we want him to provide sufficient funding, rather than to short change local authorities and poll taxpayers.<br><br>
I sought figures for Clackmannan district council. The Minister has often argued that there should be a unitary authority for the 47,000 citizens of Clackmannan. Two documents were submitted, neither of which analysed staffing or costs. I could not find any document that I could use to compare figures. Perhaps documents have not been produced because by disaggregating regional services and replicating them for 47,000 citizens, the advantage of economies of scale would be lost and the figures for staffing and costs for such a small authority would be frightening. At the moment services are provided by an authority that achieves the economies of scale referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.<br><br>

We considered the situation in North Lanarkshire. I consulted people in the finance and personnel departments. The best that they could come up with was a descriptor of that authority—420,000 people, 123,000 houses, 58,000 of them council houses and 65,000 private houses. They went on to examine the yield in tax bands and the annual revenue budget of a minimum of £550 million. North Lanarkshire authority has a capital budget of between £80 million and £100 million at least. They calculated the transitional costs. The costs just in North Lanarkshire, which is a portion of Strathclyde, will be between £30 million and £70 million.<br><br>
We have looked at Central region, at CIPFA versus Touche Ross, and at North Lanarkshire, and we have come to the conclusion that the Minister should not ask us to accept that he will give local authorities in the transitional period what he considers appropriate; he must give them sufficient. We are not asking for local authorities to be given a blank cheque. There will be negotiations and consultation and agreement can be reached on a sufficient sum for local authorities.<br><br>
I shall not go into detail on some of the examples given of grant-aided expenditure. In Scotland, the Government have a massive task. Winter road maintenance requires £235 million of grant-aided expenditure, and social services require £808 million. Those are huge sums of money. In the transitional phase, which clause 25 refers to, local authorities must get it right, and if they are underfunded they will not do so.<br><br>
Some of the amendments have raised the question of the ability to borrow. The point was made very well with reference to the South Ayrshire authority. It is important that local authorities have the power to provide sufficent accommodation for their staff. I can foresee what will happen in Central region, for example, if the Minister accepts the bids from authorities that want to stand alone. We will have the ludicrous situation of them not having any property at the end of the transitional period. However, such an authority will have the responsibility to deliver services and it will have the staff. The Minister must do something that leads us to believe that he will give authorities sufficient funds and powers to do the job that they wish.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I wish to raise a couple of specific matters, as the Minister was unwilling to accept some interventions from me. On 7 December, the Scottish Office issued a document that referred to the £5 million which the Secretary of State has decided will be additional money for preparing for reform. The answer to the written question on 7 December from the hon. Member for Kincardine, and Deeside (Mr Kynoch) sets out certain figures. The figure that caught my attention was that relating to care in the community and the independent living fund.<br><br>
I have recently asked questions about the matter and asked one of the Prime Minister. The figures that we have revealed not simply for Scotland but for the United Kingdom show that only 12.5 per cent of the independent living fund for this year will be disbursed by the end of the year—that is, £500,000 out of £4 million. The reason for that—so I am told and so those in the involved in the fund are told—is that the trigger mechanism of £200 per week
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
expenditure on those applying means that 57 authorities in the United Kingdom have not submitted applications. The cost to them of supporting such a bid would be very high.<br><br>
If the estimates are based on the current spending in supporting people in relation to the independent living fund—at present, only 12.5 per cent of those who could be supported—they must be grossly underestimating the real needs of a local authority to provide the £200 per week care that is required and which would then trigger the fund for individuals.<br><br>
Next year, the fund will stand at £11 million. This year, it is £4 million and only £500,000 is being spent. As I said, next year it will be £11 million and, presumably, the year after it will be increased. If the Secretary of State is serious and wishes those who need that fund to be supported by the social work departments in Scotland, surely he must increase the estimate required for independent living fund support. No doubt those who have more knowledge about care in the community, when we discuss social work in detail, will find the same deficiency. The estimates are so far out that people will be denied services. Alternatively, they will pay for the services.<br><br>
As we have seen from care in the community, families have been forced to pay extra sums to keep their elderly parents and relatives in nursing homes. If they cannot find the money from their own funds, they are told that they must take their mother, father or relative elsewhere. People are already forced to pay council tax and national taxes, and now increased charges. That will be the scenario if the Minister gets things wrong in the transition year or in the first five years when as has been said, there will be much variety in the level of taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Knapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that clause 25 merely authorises the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, to make grants? Is there a danger that the hon. Gentleman is treating the provisions as a money resolution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted, when I hear the word revolution—[Hon. Members: "Resolution."]—Oh, a money resolution. I thought it was revolution; it is a natural psychological set for some of us! But that was the old Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the old Michael Connarty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, perhaps the old Michael Connarty is still alive somewhere under this suit.<br><br>
The main issue is whether the Government correctly estimate the cost of their policies and policies that they encourage. For example, on 23 February <i>The Guardian</i> reported that the Public Accounts Committee criticised the Government for their
<br><blockquote><p>"'unacceptable' funding arrangements which favour grant-maintained schools."</p></blockquote>
The Government aspire to implement opting out in Scotland, but it is important that the cost is estimated and proper funding supplied. Many authorities, if they do not get opt out, are moving to the developed management of schools model. In Strathclyde, for example, it costs a cluster of schools £50,000 a year to maintain and support that decentralisation. That is £8 million per annum on Strathclyde's budget. If the Minister does not get the structure and transitional costs correct, matters will not be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0462">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 829</span>
properly organised or funded. I hope that the Minister will think seriously about that, as I am sure that we shall return to the subject in education debates.<br><br>
Finally, the Government do not seem to have a realisatic assessment of what it costs to run local authorities. That is mainly because they are hidebound by a constraint placed on them by the Treasury. This is not entirely a question of the Government's wish to break up local government for the advantage of what they think will be a few bantustans. I repeat my prediction that the disaster for the Tories is only beginning if they bring in the reforms and people see the services that are being offered and receive their council tax bills. The cost of the reforms to the local authorities has been estimated at between £3 and £7.50 a week. The rise may not be imposed all in the same year, but there will be a creeping increase.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central hit the nail on the head. People will see what the reforms cost when they get their council tax bills and they will see what the Government have taken away from them as a result of their refusal to fund their decisions. Services will cost more or will be denied to people, and only because the Government will not have got the arrangements right. A sufficient amount of money should be allocated to ensure that the transition is properly planned. If the Minister looks at the transitional costs he may realise that the job is not worth doing and that the reforms should be abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to pick up on clause 25 and the necessity for the Government to estimate the expenditure of the new authorities. My remarks will relate back to the issues that we touched on in the previous debate. A budget will have to be created for every authority so that the Government can estimate how much authorities should be given in grant and how much they should be permitted to borrow. That exercise will be enormously complex. The Government must make it clear how they arrive at their final figures. Those figures will involve a disaggregation of the figures for each service and a reallocation of resources. Estimates will have to be made of the costs resulting from (loss of economies of scale and of the alternative arrangements that will have to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that that is not the case? The shadow authorities in the time period envisaged in clause 25 will not deliver any services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have to establish what the costs of the shadow authorities will be and how they will be run. Those estimates will be based on what happens in the present authorities, whose responsibilities the shadow authorities will be starting to pick up. Structures and administrative mechanisms will have to be established. The Minister must make it clear that all those costings will be spelt out.<br><br>
There is a danger of financial gerrymanders, as well as of geographical gerrymanders. Some Opposition Members predict that the result will be grave things falling on the Tories' heads, even in their strongholds, but I think that they are being too optimistic. I think that we are likely to see financial gerrymandering—that the Tories will decide to allocate grants and the ability to borrow to favour those authorities in which they believe that they have a serious chance of electoral success. There will be clear and unadulterated discrimination against Labour authorities,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
based on what has happened in the past. That is why we must have clarity about the basis on which allocations are made.<br><br>
Some of my hon. Friends have mentioned Wandsworth. Other examples such as Westminster spring to mind. However, those examples are a digression. We need clarity about how grants are to be allocated and how money is to be distributed. The estimates that the Opposition have given will lead to school closures, to cuts in staffing, and to police and fire services being slashed. Under the new system that the Government intend to introduce, there will be reductions in the number of bursaries that are made available. We must warn people that that is the result of the Government's deliberate attempt to underestimate the genuine costs of transition.<br><br>
I do not believe that the shadow authority will cost £23 million. The Government must make clear how additional costs will be met. Who will meet the costs? Will the money come from the Scottish Office tranche of expenditure? If so, what additional opportunities will be lost? The Minister said that £23 million was a relatively small sum to take out of the total Scottish Office budget. I accept that. However, the Minister knows that the majority of the Scottish Office budget is predetermined for on-going projects and commitments.<br><br>
We are considering £23 million of the marginal spend, which is available for flexible use. What projects and opportunities are to be given up? The percentage of discretionary spend for which £23 million accounts is greater than £23 million out of the entire Scottish Office budget. The Minister has not commented on that point. He should give the Committee a clear commitment to be transparent about how the sums are allocated. People could then make genuine judgments about the fairness of the allocations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friends the Members for Govan and for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), who have recent experience of delivering local government services, are right. The transitional costs will be substantial. Any reorganisation costs more than consultants or optimistic Ministers predict. Earlier, the Minister claimed that it was possible for the transitional costs to be lower than the projected sum. He must be the most credulous Minister ever to approach a Dispatch Box. He must believe that there are pots of gold at the end of the rainbow.<br><br>
I have examined the list of councils where the biggest organisations and the least disaggregation will take place. Of all Conservative Members who represent Scottish constituencies, the wisest operators are the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang)—the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>Dumfries and Galloway will remain a unitary authority. The least disaggregation will occur there. The transition will probably cost less there than anywhere else.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if the Minister could comment not only on the transitional costs of the new authorities but the suspended animation of existing authorities. Will scope for continuing to develop the services of those blighted authorities be curtailed? The reorganisation of local authorities cannot be viewed in isolation.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0463">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 831</span>
<p>Several hon. Friends have mentioned care in the community. In Lothian, protracted negotiations are taking place between Lothian health board and Lothian regional council about transferring responsibilities, services and properties. That will coincide with local government reorganisation. It will involve additional work for the new social work department. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain not only the additional costs for the new local authorities, which will run up during the year in question, but the co-incidental problems of existing local authorities, which will continue to deliver services, although they will be about to go out of existence. That delivery is crucial to a range of vulnerable people who depend on the community care services. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.</p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Naturally I have a bias against the Treasury because it is at the heart of the Westminster system, to which I am opposed. I shall be content to vote for anything that left out the consent of the Treasury on any issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ask Gordon Brown about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) and I do not always see eye to eye on such issues. I accept that we work within a wholly hierarchical structure in Parliament: at the top of the pyramid is the Treasury; well below it is the Secretary of State for Scotland; and well below him are the local authorities, which the amendment covers. I recognise that local authorities are creatures of statute: they are allowed to do just exactly what the House tells them to do; they can spend exactly what the House tells them that they can spend.<br><br>
It is vaguely unacceptable that mandarins in the Treasury can determine what will happen on the ground with the delivery of local government services. That is why amendment No. 286 is so relevant and why the Committee should recognise that the people who know most about the transitional period, the shadow authorities and how to get the services moved from the old structure to the new should be making the judgments. They should determine the cost expenditure and the Treasury should not have a veto over that.<br><br>
The Minister said that £23 million was available to cover transitional costs. I understood the Minister to say that the £23 million was outwith the local government settlement. What is not outwith the proposals, however, is the settlement given to the Secretary of State for Scotland. If that £23 million is being spent on transitional costs, it is not being spent on something else that is the right hon. Gentleman's responsibility.<br><br>
The Minister did not say from where the £23 million will come. What other services will suffer as a result? If the Secretary of State does not take the £23 million away from the other services for which he is responsible, we should know exactly from where that money is likely to come. At this stage, the Minister should be able to say where the money will come from and if he will take the money from other areas.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 832</span>
I am confused about the shadow authorities. Different regional councils will be elected in May, which will come into existence between 1994 and 1996. The first priority of those elected councils is to continue to provide the services for which they are responsible. All of the officers currently working in those councils should continue to treat that as their priority. The same point applies to existing district councils. They still have two years to run and will continue to prioritise the delivery of services for which they are responsible.<br><br>
The councils will have to take account of what is happening in the Committee and the Bill. At some point, the Bill will be placed on the statute book and will become the law of Scotland. Those council officers must then start planning about how they will implement the changes proposed in the Bill, from a two-tier to a single-tier structure. I assume that the Bill will become law early next year. [HON. MEMBERS "NO".] We obviously do not know. If the progress that the Committee has made is considered and the size of the Bill is compared to that of others, I would expect the Bill to be in Committee until June. Then it would have to go on Report, which would take us up to the summer recess. The Bill would not go to the other place until October or November, so it would be January or February before the Bill became law.<br><br>
The Minister is laughing at that suggested timetable. I do not know why, because that would be how long it would take properly to scritinise a Bill of this size. Such things have to be assumed. I see that you, Sir James, may agree with me, but the Minister does not.<br><br>
At what stage should existing councils begin to plan towards the new single-tier authorities? I assume that they would set up joint committees later this year or early next year and allocate seconded officers—take them away from providing the services of current councils—to plan for the new councils.<br><br>
Tayside regional council has written to me, stating that there will have to be substantial planning for the new authorities. There will have to be a development of corporate strategies, the systems will have to be put in place, and procedures will have to be worked out. Will that work be carried out by officers seconded from existing regional and district councils? Will they continue to be paid by existing councils? Will the cost of offices seconded to plan the changes be borne by the shadow authorities in 1995–96?<br><br>
The Minister should make it clear whether officers seconded to planning will be reimbursed by the shadow authorities. If so, will the money be part of the £23 million that has been allocated by the Government to cover the cost of the shadow authorities?<br><br>
When the shadow authorities come into existence after the elections of May 1995, they will have councillors, but no staff except officers who have been seconded from other councils. By what mechanism will councillors elected in May 1995 make staff appointments? Will they use seconded officers as advisers? Will the seconded officers apply to become officers in the shadow authorities?<br><br>
The matter is complicated. I do not understand the mechanism by which the changes will work. The Government should explain how they will be implemented and who will be charged with the cost of making the new appointments. It is very well to make appointments in education, social work, housing, leisure and recreation,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I0464">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
economic development and transport—different directors have to be appointed—but shadow authorities have to pay such officials from the moment that they are appointed.<br><br>
The Minister shakes his head. I am happy to give way to him. Once a shadow authority has appointed—for example, a director of eduction—will it be responsible for paying him in the new unitary authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point is that shadow authorities are not responsible for the delivery of any services during the year that is dealt with by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are not responsible for delivering services, but in that year the people who are appointed to positions in the new directorates, which will come into being in 1996–97, will have to draw up budget plans for services and plan for providing those services. Of course they will have to be paid. A person cannot be expected to work for a shadow authority without being paid.<br><br>
I have a list of the salaries that are paid by one council to directors. The sums are substantial. For example, the education director was paid £88,200 a year at April 1993. The director of finance was paid £81,900. The director of building and works was paid £77,175. These substantial sums will have to be paid by the shadow authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are there any people on the list who are paid as little as Members of Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a long list. No, there are no local government officers who get paid as little as Members of Parliament. Councillors, however, are paid substantially less than Members of Parliament. I do not know what the civil servants in the Scottish Office are paid. I suspect that it is as much as people in local government. They are shaking their heads.<br><br>
Time is running short and my hon. Friend is anxious to make a contribution before we break for dinner. We want the Minister to make clear what expenditure the shadow authorities will have to incur in employing staff and so on. Where will that money come from?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to sum up and pick a word to describe the Government's incompetence and idiocy on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Consummate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I hear suggestions from my hon. Friends. I have been in the House only seven years but it sometimes seem like 70. I have never heard so much nonsense spoken by the Government. They simply do not seem to care about the financial consequences of this reorganisation. We have tabled amendments to the clause and my hon. Friends have spoken to them. The Minister is right when he says that the clause is about the funding of the transitional period up to the proper coming into being in March 1996 of the new councils. But surely that transitional year will not take place in a vacuum. Will the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
Government's daft laws of economics be suspended for a year so there will be no problems? They will therefore borrow what they want and spend what they want: capital grants will be available and we will all slide gently from the old system to a new system. That absolute drivel and the Government must know what is happening.<br><br>
Local government is already being savaged by cuts of £330 million in real terms over the next three years. That is the first consideration. We cannot ignore the reality of what the Government are already imposing on local government over the next three years. Whether it be in Northern Ireland, Wales, England or Scotland; it is a lot of money, a lot of services and a lot of jobs. That is the background before we even get into the madness of the costing of this reorganisation. Earlier in our proceedings it was revealed that no matter what this costs, the Government will provide 87p for every pound that is spent. That will come. It is excellent news for COSLA. It is excellent news for the local authorities individually.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not to the taxpayers though.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that. For the first time, the Government do not care who they hit in taxations terms, income taxpayers or council taxpayers. If they were true even to the 87 per cent. support, which they are not, it would still mean that the bill for this crazy reorganisation is to be picked up by the taxpayers, who are already being savaged by the Government's policies. The Government are being reckless and irresponsible with my constituents' money I thought that the Government and the Opposition were here to look at value for money and the probity of financial expenditure. In election after election the Government tell us that we can trust them with our money. What a hollow ring that has when we see what they are doing.<br><br>
In this transitional period, against the background of massive cuts and Government cluelessness about the costs, we are being asked to accept clause 25 as it is. A very vulnerable group will be caught up in the process—namely, the voluntary sector. We have tried and failed to get an amendment on the amendment paper about that although we respect the decisions that have been made.<br><br>
When we talk about transitional funding we must remember that it is not only councils who will need money but the recipients, the beneficiaries of local authorities year upon year. Nearly £100 million is given to the voluntary sector in Scotland. It does some excellent work in difficult circumstances in some of the most problematical areas of Scotland. Are we to believe that the voluntary sector can sit idly by when there are budgets to discuss, staff to employ—</span></p>
