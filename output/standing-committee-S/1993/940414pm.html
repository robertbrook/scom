This morning the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland made the welcome announcement that Scottish water quangos would not have the power to disconnect and that disconnection would be illegal. This afternoon, on the Floor of the House, I asked the Leader of the House whether the Secretary of State for the Environment would make a statement on whether that would apply—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not a matter for the Committee. That is my ruling. I hope that the hon. Member will not pursue the matter and that he will remain seated. I have ruled on previous occasions that what is said on the Floor of the House has nothing to do with the Committee's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I understand not just from the Floor of the House, but from discussions in the Corridor that the Leader of the House was unaware of the fact that that announcement was to be made. Therefore, it is important that the Minister makes it clear that he has the authority of the Government and the Cabinet for that welcome statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no control over what the Leader of the House does or does not know. It is not a matter for the Committee nor for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has become all too clear that senior colleagues in the Government had no inkling of the undertaking that was given by Scottish Office Ministers. It is right and proper that I should accept the Chair's ruling but, once again, I want to ask the Minister whether he is absolutely sure that the Cabinet knew of the policy change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We shall hear much more about the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) and the astonishing answer that was given to my hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalywell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask a question about clause 75(4)(a) on page 59 which states:
	<br><q><p>"where the person informs the authority of the ending of his occupation (but not timeously), the twenty-eighth day after informing the authority"</p></q>
Timeously could have various legal implications. Is that a proper statement in law? If so, what do the Government mean by timeously? That could be a matter for litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that is to be the interpretation applied by the courts to any reference to timeously? That is extremely unsatisfactory. Has the Minister consulted the Law Society of Scotland about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the Minister's attitude, it will not make our progress in the Committee any easier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman carries on as though he were Lord God Almighty.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 381, in page 60, line 8, after 'may', insert
	<br><q><p>'after consultation with the relevant water and sewerage authority and with the Customers Council, and with their agreement'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 380, in page 60, line 37, leave out from 'to' to 'or' in line 38 and insert
	<br><q><p>'the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council'.</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 432, in clause 79, page 62, line 6, after 'Treasury', insert 'and the 'Customers Council'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 76 deals with the ridiculous position of local authorities which, after being shunned, dismembered and thoroughly abused by the Government, will be asked to collect the water charges from domestic consumers and the business sector. The amendment is a probing amendment about consultation, but it begs the more significant question of when the Government will ditch local authorities and change over to other organisations as they move toward a privatised model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the collection of charges in England and Wales is complex, but there is widespread concern in Scotland that local authorities will be required to make the collections. Attendant on that decision are many implications affecting local authorities regarding debt collection and haranguing people if there are delays in making payments. The local authorities will have hurled at them much abuse for collecting a charge that they had nothing to do with setting. That charge will be determined by the water authorities, the customers council and, ultimately, the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something iniquitous in using local authorities as a post office when the decisions will be taken by other bodies. I want to register the strongest possible protest at that development. Amendment No. 381 aims to get a response from the Government about consultation, possibly including some of the other issues that I have highlighted in this brief contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue. I shall try to explain the position. In two years' time the water authorities will be operating. We must decide later in the year, after consultation, whether it would be most effective for the local authorities to collect the charges, certainly to begin with. They have the necessary computers, administration and council tax system in place. That does not mean that that is the decision that we shall take later this year or that such a decision will remain forever. As I have said clearly, the water authorities should decide what system of charging they want to use when they take over responsibility. We shall decide later this year whether the local authorities will collect the water and sewerage charges in the early years of the new system or whether they will want them collected in another way under their responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1804</span>
The clause sets out the position and the procedures that will be followed. If the councils are to collect water charges, an order will have to be laid to implement that. I hope that there will be considerable discussion later this year between the new authorities, the Scottish Office and the local authorities to ensure that there is agreement. The water authorities will not be in place later this year, but there may be chairmen and perhaps chief executives. There will have to be discussions between the Scottish Office and the local authorities so that they have as much time as possible for considering which system will be brought into action in April 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Daiyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is considerable concern that no financial burden should fall on the local authorities as a result of them collecting water and sewerage charges. That is all mixed up with schedule 10, which deals with the recovery by diligence of charges payable to a collecting authority. We are particularly anxious that the clause does not mention how local councils will be reimbursed by the water and sewerage authorities for undertaking such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister clarify the Government's intentions? I have three specific questions. First, will the water and sewerage authorities bear any bad debt arising from unpaid bills? Secondly, local councils will have to modify their collection systems because the existing domestic sewerage charges system does not differentiate between properties connected or unconnected to sewers. Will the costs resulting from the changes be met by the new water and sewerage authorities or by the Government? Thirdly, will the local authorities be allowed to pass on the full cost of collecting charges to the water and sewerage authorities? Those are important and urgent questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they are important. The issues discussed by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Daiyell) will be resolved. If it is decided that the local authorities will collect, they will negotiate with the water authorities and with the Secretary of State about the administrative charges that they will be able to levy for the collection service. It may be financially advantageous for them to use the computer machinery that they have. They will have to reorganise because many councils will be changing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be no adverse financial impact on local authorities. It would be quite wrong if there were because they would be used as a collection service. The local authorities already have the power to collect charges for council tax. The important problems that the hon. Member for Linlithgow mentioned should be discussed between the Secretary of State, the local councils and the authorities so that the system can be set up and running smoothly by 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the firm indication the local authorities will not be out of pocket and their full costs will be reimbursed by the water authorities if they are to be the collection authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, in no way would they suffer for being made the collection authority, which is often a pretty difficult role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1000">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1805</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I have been saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much to be pursued. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow has asked some pertinent questions. We accept that such a role would be on a no-cost basis to the local authorities. It begs the bigger question of under what conditions the local authorities would have to participate in the collection. Plainly, from the Minister's statement, that may not be the course that the Government wish to follow. I hope that there will be flexibility in relation to local authorities. After all, they will be local authorities set up under statute and they should not be forced to do anything that they do not wish to do. The points made about costs are crucial. In view of the Minister's assurances, I shall not press the amendment, in the hope that many further discussions will take place before the scheme is implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee might wish to know that I have checked with the Clerk's Department and, whereas it is out of order to raise proceedings in Committee on the Floor of the House, it is not out of order to raise proceedings on the Floor of the House in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Member challenging my ruling?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, if the hon. Member is not challenging my ruling, he has not raised a point of order. I am responsible; I am the custodian of the rule in this Committee, not the Clerks. I made a ruling which the hon. Member is not challenging. Therefore, it is not a relevant point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 567, in page 60, line 16, leave out 'and recover'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 568, in page 60, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>';and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>'(c) that it shall be the duty of the providing authority to pursue any outstanding charges.'.</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 576, in schedule 10, page 135, line 28, at beginning insert—
	<br><q><p>'unless it appears that the costs of diligence may be likely to exceed the amount of any sums recovered as a result of the use of such diligences'.</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 575, in schedule 10, page 135, leave out lines 35 and 36.</p>
	<p>No. 577, in schedule 10, page 135, line 37, after 'arrestment', insert—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1806</span>
	<br><q><p>'in accordance with section 49 of Schedule 2 to the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 subject to the figures contained within tables A, B and C of Schedule 2 being amended so that each figure of net earnings be increased in accordance with the annual rate of inflation with corresponding reductions in the deductions to be made from said national earnings.'.</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments all relate to the collection of water charges. Amendments Nos. 567 and 568 make a clear distinction between the providing authorities, which are the water boards, and the collecting authorities, which are the local authorities, as opposed to the Government putting the total duty on local authorities for collection and debt enforcement, thus freeing the boards to take the cash but not the obvious responsibility that goes with enforcing their collection policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 575 and 576 would ban poinding and warrant sales from being used for water service debt collection, as well as ensuring that the costs of collection would not exceed the amount of any sums recovered by such diligencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 577 deals with an anomaly and unfairness in the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. It is a technical point, but one on which I hope the Government will be prepared to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 567 and 568 ensure that the collecting authorities—that is, the new councils—collect only payments due on behalf of the water boards and do not do their dirty work in the pursuit of debts through courts or other debt collection agencies. The responsible body in terms of pricing and debt collection policies should be seen to be the responsible body. That is the import of the amendment. If a water board takes policy decisions, it should also publicly and clearly take the consequences of those decisions. If a water board wishes to pursue debts overdue to it, it should do so in its own right and should not hide behind another organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, I see the role of local authorities as purely an agency one—to facilitate, for an appropriate fee, the due payments and so, sensibly and efficiently, to allow their local offices to be used for customer ease and customer access, as presently happens in the relationship between regional and district councils. The district councils can, on a local basis, collect payments as an agent on behalf of the region. Those local authorities would be able to pass the money on to the water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the new local authorities to be the fall guys—those who are blamed for the pricing and debt collection policies of the water boards, policies which the local authorities would have no part in creating and which they may utterly oppose. I do not want them to have to enforce those policies against their will, so I propose the separation of provision and the collection of overdue debts. There should be transparency so that the paying public can see who the decision makers are. There are too many examples already of central Government lumbering local government with the blame for policy mistakes. The local authorities, as the collecting authorities, are at the sharp end of the services and get the blame, yet they are only carrying out policies created and placed on them by others. This botched Bill must not be added to the burden on local government, which deserves better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1807</span>
If water boards wish to raise prices or pursue water debts, they should do so openly and in their own right. They must be seen to be responsible for their policies. Amendments Nos. 575 and 576 would stop debt pursuit if the costs of collection are greater than the sum recovered. That is the common-sense approach and reflects my absolute detestation of warrant sales. They are barbaric and unacceptable in any modern, civilised society. Warrant sales are immoral and completely inefficient. They are not cost-effective in any way. The amendments would prohibit the removal of household furniture and effects from the homes of people who have not paid the new bills to be imposed by the water boards for the supply of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Parliament that makes a pretence of representing the interests of the Scottish community must accept these amendments because the use of that diligence is immoral, and because warrant sales are not effective in the recovery of debt. They do not work. The most recent detailed research into warrant sales was carried out in 1977 by the Scottish Office's central research unit. That research found that in only 3 per cent. of personal warrant sales, as distinct from sales to recover business and commercial debts, was the sum recovered sufficient to pay all the debt and all the expenses. The real beneficiaries of warrant sales are not the creditors, but the sheriff's officers. That is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office research showed that the debtor continued to owe money after 97 per cent. of warrant sales had been held. Even in commercial warrant sales involving building and haulage contractors, for example, the debtor continued to owe money after the sale in 84 per cent. of cases. So in only 16 per cent. of commercial warrant sales were all expenses and the original debt recovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence from the Scottish Office shows that warrant sales are not at all effective even in commercial cases, let alone in the traumatic and unacceptable circumstances of personal debt. But my main objection is not their inefficiency. It is that they are barbaric and unacceptable in a civilised society. The Scottish Law Commission agrees. Its research shows that most debtors belong to the lowest income groups. Many are unemployed, or employed only intermittently. They depend for their subsistence on social security or the intermittent earning of small amounts. Those debtors live on the margin of the statutory level of subsistence. They have no savings. Their only property consists of small household items of minimal value. Parliament should protect such people and not render them vulnerable to the barbarity of a warrant sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the threat of a warrant sale, debtors are induced to make a promise of payment by instalment which they are simply unable to maintain because the level of each instalment is unreasonably high. It is time for warrant sales to cease, especially for a daily, essential water service.

Amendment No. 577 would adjust the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 in the interests of fairness and to take account of inflation. Uprating should have happened long
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1808</span>
ago. The matter is technical but I hope that the Minister will tackle it. The Debtors (Scotland) Act sets out rules for the use of earnings arrestments. The tables in the Act have not been uprated since it was passed seven years ago. The Act sets out the money that can be deducted each week from earnings of a specified amount. For example, a person who earns £100 a week will have £13 deducted each week until payment is completed. However, inflation has eroded the real value of money since 1987. Therefore, £100 in 1987 is worth only £85 or less nowadays. But the amounts deducted from earnings have not been reduced to take account of inflation. The amendment proposes that earnings should be uprated by inflation and contributions correspondingly reduced to take account of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should provide new tables so that earnings figures are uprated. The tables could be added, by amendment, to the Debtors (Scotland) Act. Section 49(7) of the Act states:
	<br><q><p>"The Lord Advocate may by regulation vary tables a, b and c".</p></q>
It is not even necessary to deal with the matter by amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendments try to tackle unfairness. I hope that they will be accepted. The Government's response will reveal their true attitude towards the most vulnerable people, who would be hardest hit by failure to take action. I oppose warrant sales, especially in acute circumstances and for a daily essential service, which no one can avoid using. In the interests of fairness, the government should consider the amendments and take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an eloquent plea on warrant sales and related topics.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Warrant sales are not an acceptable way of chasing debt, given their disgraceful effect on individuals.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not told me what the other methods might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain issues arise from the amendments that relate particularly to the collection of charges. If the charges are to be collected by the local authorities, they, of course, will be able to use the summary warrant procedure that is available to them for the collection of council tax. That procedure is open only to certain public bodies such as local authorities and the Inland Revenue. It allows the creditor to approach the sheriff for a summary warrant which the debtor has no opportunity to contest. All the options for debt recovery—arrestment of wages, bank arrestment and poinding—become available. Certainly, as the hon. Gentleman said, the summary warrant procedure is a severe one. I have said that no decision has been made as to whether charges will be collected by the water authorities or through the local authorities. The latter option would be simpler early on because computer information would be available. The summary warrant procedure would not be available to the water authorities so they would have to use the normal procedure of instituting a court action in which the debtor could be heard and judgment pronounced against him or her before any of the recovery procedures could be set in train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Angus, East I have no wish to see any warrant sales. I know that all members of the Committee have encountered constituents' problems arising from warrant sales. Perhaps in recent years they have become less frequent. It is good that matters are treated as sympathetically as possible by the sheriff officers and the courts. In any event, matters are much simpler under the summary warrant procedure than they were in earlier days. The water charges will be collected either by the local authorities, using the procedures that are available to them, or by the water authorities, but, as I have said, in the early stages the former method is more likely to be used because it will be simpler given the use of computers to contact those who are listed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a disappointing answer. Obviously, in the early days, the collection of money by the local authorities as agents would be a matter of efficiency. However, the Minister has not taken on board the other relevant fact—that they should not necessarily collect overdue debt. That should be the job of the providing authority, because the policies of that body on pricing and debt will be the ones implemented. The authority that creates the policy should be seen clearly by the general public to be the one that implements it. I am disgusted that local government is likely once again to be blamed for other bodies' policies. It might have to implement debt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1810</span>
collection policies with which it did not necessarily agree, and which it might downright oppose. That would be very unfair to local government. I should like more transparency. If the water boards want to pursue debts in that fashion, through warrant sales and such methods, on their heads be it. The population should be able to see what is going on. I want the Minister to distinguish between the providing and the collecting authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that warrant sales are severe. They are not just severe, but disgusting and draconian. They should be stopped completely. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South as usual gibbers away from his place and will not make a speech. I should like to hear him make a speech in defence of warrant sales. I remind him, as the Minister had the courtesy to mention that the Scottish National party has a long record of opposing the practice. I recommend that the hon. Gentleman reads the Bill against warrant sales that we introduced in 1989. We have a long and honourable record. I invite him to advocate openly this disgusting method of debt collection—with your permission, Mr. Martin. I want warrant sales to be banned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Government are unwilling to act in this matter. I will press the matter because Parliament has a duty to the less well-off and most vulnerable in society who will be affected by these debts, finding that what little income they have is endangered by the humiliating warrant sale and other debt collection procedures. We owe them a duty to speak in their defence, which is why I tabled the amendments and why I will press them to a vote if the Government do not accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting into trouble because I have a lack of confidence in much of the legal advice apparently being given to Scottish Office Ministers. How does what the Minister said square with clause 78(3) which states:

trying to avoid criticism of the local authority over water charges. However, he must remember that from 1996 onward there will be separate bills for water and sewerage, so people will know where the bills come from. We are merely using the machinery and staff of the local authority to collect the money and do the administrative work.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary agree that the local authority would implement court, and other debt, procedures, which is what I mean by it doing the board's dirty work.

It is the Government's intention that prosecution in the recovery of debt will be undertaken with the local authority being the pursuer in the action of diligence for recovery? As I understand the Bill, the legal authority to which the money is due is a separate legal entity. Will local authorities act as agents in the recovery of debt? If so, it is certainly not made clear.

Will the Minister think about that issue? It has serious repercussions for the position of the local authorities, as opposed to the water authorities, in the legal process.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to reduced charges. I do not want to go over the ground that we covered this morning, but the amendments address the problem of those who cannot afford to pay extra for water or any other commodity. That problem has arisen because of the Government's meanness in their attempts to punish the poor over the past 15 years and to save money on their public expenditure commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of 100 per cent. rebates for income support recipients was extremely helpful. As a consequence of changes made in the Social Security Act 1986 which were implemented in 1988, that cover was removed. The Government now pretend that there is a notional amount included in income support to cover contributions to water and sewerage services. That is manifestly not the case: there is a substantial shortfall between the notional element included and the amount required to pay for those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will Ministers from the Scottish Office and the Department of Social Security consider an income-based rebate scheme? Other people, as well as income support recipients, are clearly in need of such a scheme. However,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1813</span>
we refer specifically to income support recipients, because they are an identifiable group. There are currently 931,000 Scots in families living entirely on income support, and approximately 530,000 claimants. Many Scots live in desperate poverty, even if defined according to the Government's income support levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want people's ability to pay to be considered further and the Government to consider an income-based system of rebate, which would help the neediest in our communities. If the Secretary of State is asked to define in regulations where reduced charges may apply, he should recognise that there are no more deserving cases than the Scots on income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we are making a practical proposition. We realise that the Government may not wish to accept our points in their entirety. However, we hope for a measured degree of support for the spirit behind the amendments and a commitment to discuss how the water authorities will deal with the issues of water poverty and debt at a time when the economy is barely growing, when incomes are constrained and when people are living virtually on the edge of their financial resources. I move the amendment with that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with transitional relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, amendment No. 417 would appear to deliver something quite desirable. Given that transitional relief schemes of the sort provided by the clause will affect charges, it would appear reasonable that the customers council should be at least consulted about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we decided against such a provision for very good reasons. First, we have not yet settled upon the form of any transitional relief scheme that might be introduced under the clause. Secondly, transitional relief will require preparatory work that would need to be put in hand at an early stage in order to ensure that those operating the scheme had as much notice as possible about its form and content. It could well be the case that much of this work would need to be done before the new customers council was established. The amendment, therefore, could unnecessarily constrain such work and could lead to operational difficulties. I can, however, say that if a scheme is being devised or revised and the customers council is available to be consulted, we shall certainly seek its views before putting the scheme in its final form. I believe that the amendment is sincere and well intentioned, but for the reasons that I have outlined, we are unable to support it. That is mainly because of the issue of timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment no. 342, I can understand the hon. Member's desire to ensure parliamentary scrutiny of regulations. However, I do not consider that the affirmative resolution procedure is necessary in this case. The clause is modelled on section 80 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which contains parallel powers in relation to council tax levels. Regulations madeunder the 1992 Act do not require affirmative resolution by either House, let alone both Houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1814</span>
The powers proposed in clause 77 would allow the Secretary of State to reduce certain charges recoverable under a charges scheme. If my right hon. Friend makes such regulations, hon. Members on both sides of the House can scrutinise them and pray against the regulations before they come into effect if they consider them inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Fife, Central has put much thought into the amendments, they would be difficult to implement from the point of view of timing and the subsequent statutory instruments that give the opportunity to pray against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows how difficult it is, given parliamentary procedures, to make the prayers that may be necessary. What timing do the Government envisage for the establishment of the customers council? I am not clear about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have talked much about the customers council, but we have not laid down any firm provisions on timing. Obviously, we must first set up the water authorities, with their chairmen, deputy chairmen and chief executives. We hope to do that subsequent to the Bill receiving parliamentary approval, which will probably not be until the end of the Session. Water authorities will be set up early next year. We shall then move on to setting up the customers council, which will be important to a host of issues. It will be in place as soon as is practicable and certainly before 1996 when the water authorities are enacted. There is a great deal of preparatory work to be done before then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to assist the Government, but in a previous sitting the Under-Secretary gave us the undertaking that the customers council would be set up in about April 1995. I think that that has appeared in 	<i>Hansard,</i> so the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow about timing may be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a genuine interest in Scotland's poorest households. It is unlikely that the Government will accept the amendment and there is danger in terms of the consultation process in the House and the impact that regulations might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is probing. Despite the Government's unwillingness to look beyond transitional areas to the implementation of the new water authority charges, it is vital that there is a debate about the absolute scandal of poverty in the 1990s. Poverty will be a major issue in the 21st century and this technical amendment highlights a much greater need, but I realise, Mr. Martin, that that is not the preserve of the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>'shall be prescribed by reference to the needs and resources of a person liable to pay an amount under a charges scheme and such other'.</p></q>
The amendment relates to those in significant need and to the question of consultation about people who might be affected by the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Secretary of State to give a commitment to make regulations that provide for an income-based rebate scheme which includes a 100 per cent. rebate for income support recipients. From their inception, local authority water charges were paid for through the rates and the poorest households qualified for a 100 per cent. rebate or were covered for the charge through benefits. That changed in April 1988 when parts of the Social Security Act 1986 came into force. From that date householders, irrespective of income, had to pay 100 per cent. of their water rate. An allowance for water rates was incorporated in income support, but was unrelated to the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flat rate water charge, which accompanied the poll tax, was also ineligible for rebate. Although the replacement of the poll tax with the council tax introduced a closer relationship to ability to pay, the water element remains ineligible for rebate. Does the Bill deal with the threat posed to low income groups by increasing costs and does it include any serious proposal for a rebate scheme? The English experience demonstrates that affordability issues will not simply disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance, in terms of anti-poverty action, of the proposed charge collection role for local government becomes obvious. Despite having no say in the overall cost of water or in the means by which that is distributed among customers, local authorities will be responsible for collecting the new charges. Aside from any general public confusion about who is responsible for the charge, local authorities will have to collect increasing sums from people living in or near poverty. In those circumstances, are not local authorities likely to be obliged to effect the warrant sales of income support deductions or wage arrestments against non-payers whose council tax is covered fully by rebate? What will the Government do about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one underestimates the problems of those who are less well off and I wish that there were easy answers to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. However, he must recognise that water is an expensive commodity. It is not as though there will be sudden dramatic increases under the new system that will operate in two years' time. I have said clearly that the trend over the past five years of rapidly increasing water and sewerage charges is likely to continue because a large capital investment is required to bring up to standard our water and sewerage services. The hon. Gentleman's remarks about those who will have difficulty in paying their charges must worry him as they apply today and have applied last year, the previous year and the year before
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1816</span>
that. It is not as though this has dropped out of a cloud today and people are having to face a sudden increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make it clear to domestic consumers in the next two years, prior to restructuring, how much domestic sewerage services costs each of the current regional and island authorities. In May this year we shall issue a pamphlet to all householders to help them identify the costs of their water and sewerage services. That may go some way to answering the criticism of the hon. Member for Angus, East that recipients of water services will believe that the bills that they receive in two years' time will be from their local councils. It will be clear that the water authorities are making the charge and that, because of their efficient computer systems, the local councils are just doing the administrative work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the position is clear. The clause provides for a traditional reduction scheme which I hope will be of benefit, bearing in mind that in 1996 the part of the current council tax that goes toward sewerage services will be included in the water and sewerage charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, and still on the point about equity to which my hon. Friend has just referred, I must say that this particularly vindictive little clause could prevent an elected councillor who is in arrears for his water charges, perhaps because of a legitimate dispute with the water authority, from voting on issues relating to the council's collection of debts on behalf of the water authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always unedifying for this Parliament to impose such restrictions, particularly in view of the double standards that apply everywhere. Similar standards do not apply to, for example, the hon. Members for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) or for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan). Will an equivalent sanction apply to the Secretary of State's nominees who will be members of the water authorities? He is providing for a sanction against elected local councillors who will act as agents to collect debts on behal of the water authorities. He is providing for a sanction against elected local councillors who will act as

agents to collect debts on behalf of the water authorities. Will there be any equivalent sanction to affect the Secretary of State's nominees who will sit on those new water authorities, set the charges and so on if they do not pay their bills?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the purpose of the clause? It implies that a councillor who is elected by the general public cannot vote on collection issues if he or she is two months in debt to the water authority. Therefore, he or she cannot vote on a local authority matter. Such councillors are banned from dealing with such issues although that is what they were elected for, because of a two-month debt. Surely, the debt is a private matter between the councillor and an outside organisation and should be settled between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's words, the council just does administrative work, so why is this draconian power being imposed? The councillor would owe a debt to a totally outside organisation, which hardly seems a heinous enough crime to warrant the removal of decision-making powers which will effect only the staff and the administration of the local authority. Surely the councillor still has the right to vote and to make decisions about council staffing and resources. Will the Minister explain this major and draconian step? What is the rationale behind the clause? The power seems heavy in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will explain. I appreciate that debtor councillors are rare, but those who are in arrears with council tax, water charges or community charges are subject to voting restrictions. The clause continues the current law and encourages responsible local government. That is perfectly reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked about what should happen to members of the water authority. They would not be reappointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is a hangover from the poll tax, the poll tax referred to local council services. The clause includes the services of a completely different organisation. The local council acts as an agent or a go-between to pass the money to the water board. Surely there is a distinction between a measure brought in to deal with a poll tax which specifically affected local authority services and a debt which affects an outside organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Properly and understandably, Mr. Martin, you pulled me up during the debate on clause 76 for referring to clause 78(3). I am probably in the wrong, but I understood that the clause applied to anybody. If it could be confirmed that it refers to councillors in arrears, my question falls because the clause applies to a member of a local authority. I wanted to check that when I asked how subsection (3) lay with clause 76. It is simply related to local authority members and is not general, is it not? I refer to page 61, subsection (3) of clause 78.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. I note that the hon. Member for Angus, East came back, but the clause refers

only to councillors who vote on issues relative to the collection of charges which may or may not be required if we go down the local authority collection route.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 80 concerns the transfer of debts. It appears that something is happening in that operation that did not happen when the English and Welsh water debts were not transferred to the privatised water pics. In that case, a large gift was given to the private water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate I described the effect of writing off the debts of the Scottish regional councils for water and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1819</span>
sewerage services. I said that that could halve the charges of the water authorities in Scotland, if they so wished. The Minister, who is consulting his civil servants, commended Central region then for its especially low water charges. It is worth noting that Central region has also been commended for having the purest water in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the money that is being paid in charges to cover the debts were to be made available to the local authorities, the £5 billion programme of work that has been identified by the authorities and the Scottish Office could be undertaken without raising the charges by the amount that will be necessary otherwise, given the need to continue to pay the debt and at the same time take on the debts necessary to maintain and improve Scotland's water and sewerage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain why the private companies in England and Wales which charge the consumer such high rates at the moment, had the benefit of a debt write-off, when in Scotland the debts will be transferred to the new water boards? Those debts will remain a burden on Scottish consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two quick questions. Subsection (2)(b) in line 16 of page 23 uses the phrase
	<br><q><p>"whether in sterling or otherwise".</p></q>
That raises the very important question of foreign borrowing by water authorities of, for example, European currency units from the European development bank. Highland region in particular has received a lot of money from the European regional development fund. Will the Minister say whether there has been a change from the existing policy of encouraging water authorities to borrow abroad, not least from European institutions?

My second question concerns the extinguishing of existing water and sewerage authority loans by the Secretary of State. Before the 1990 privatisation of water authorities in England and Wales—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We all have the highest regard for the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have a high regard for him and, as he is a senior member of the Committee, I like to give him as much leeway as possible. I have allowed him to read out documents before, thinking that it was a one-off, but it seems that he is slipping back into the old habit of reading out documents. If he could paraphrase them, it would be helpful to the Committee and to the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paraphrasing takes longer, Mr. Martin. Section 86(1) gave the Secretary of State power by statutory instrument to extinguish all or any of the liabilities of the nominated holding company in respect of the principal of any loan. The effect of that was to reduce the loan debt of the water authorities to £5,800 million.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1820</span>
Apart from making the water undertakings a more attractive financial proposition for potential investors, the effect was to write off and eliminate from the customer charge all outstanding investment and loan repayments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question arises whether, from a consumer's perspective, it is equitable that customers in England and Wales have received a subsidy, but customers in Scotland will not. Why should not a similar arrangement be put into operation for Scottish customers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), I regret that the rules did not allow you, Mr. Martin, to call my amendment relating to the green dowry. I am sorry that the Government will not give a similar green dowry to the water authorities. It would transform their finances. I cannot let the clause pass without expressing deep regret that local authorities will not be allowed to continue to perform the superb service that they have performed in the past. They could provide such a service far more cheaply and to a higher standard than the water boards ever will. It is a pity that the Government have not seen sense over that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon Members have raised the issue of the green dowry, as it is called, that went to England and Wales. They miss the important point that in England and Wales water was privatised, whereas in Scotland it is to remain in public control. It is therefore right that the debt should move from the local authority to the water authority. The case of England and Wales is not a good parallel, because the need there was to create new companies with a capital structure that made sense to the market. Debt finance to 100 per cent. does not make sense for a private sector company. The green dowry was necessary because of restructuring. I am sure that hon. Members who have been so critical of privatisation throughout the proceedings would not want us to privatise the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that it was necessary for the Treasury to hand out that green dowry to lubricate the privatisation. Why is it okay to give out taxpayers' money to sweeten investors who bought the water authorities south of the border, whereas no such money is forthcoming to assist consumers and council tax payers in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because, as I said previously, water in Scotland will remain in public control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Government are subsidising the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The parallel that hon. Members are trying to draw is a false one and I am surprised that they should try to do so, as they have been dead against anything to do with privatisation, as indeed I am in respect of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 80 is extensive and covers many aspects of the financial mechanisms attaching to the new authorities. Many of the provisions are technical, as the hon. Member for Linlithgow observed in relation to ERDF funding and loans from the European sector. I shall check that and give

him detailed comment on whether that policy would be continued by the water authority. It is too early to give him a firm answer because the water authority will want to decide where it will get that loan, if not from the national loans fund. I shall bear in mind what he told me and write to him with the most up-to-date information that I can give him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in the Minister. Perhaps, in the longer term—when reading 	<i>Hansard</i>—I shall be grateful to him. He set out the next steps towards privatisation, which he said had already accurred in England and Wales. When the Minister goes—I believe it is to be shortly—to the lambing and permanently outwith his ministerial post, I hope that he will look back. When the Government take the next steps—offering the Scottish water boards' assets to the private sector, setting up companies and writing off debts, as they did in England and Wales—I hope that he will be as vociferous as he was just then against privatisation and against subsidising the private sector so that it can take over Scottish water. That is on the agenda. Debts have not been written off for the water boards. The measures are not about providing water to the public—they are not about the consumer—but about creating a structure and leaving, as the next step, the gift of substantial amounts of public sector money. The money of the consumer and of the taxpayer will be given over to a private sector takeover of Scottish water.

I hope that the Minister sends his card back to the Conservative party when it betrays him; indeed, he is setting up the betrayal of the Scottish people now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did me the courtesy of answering my first question. However, I repeat: does he accept the view of COSLA that Scottish consumers are not benefitting from the massive write-off benefits that English consumers—to the tune of £800 million—have received. I do not know the answer. What is the explanation? It is a matter of considerable consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have been criticising the current cost of English water. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be pleased to know that the cost of Scottish water is below that of England. The same applies to sewerage. As the water industry will remain in public hands, it is normal for the debt to be transferred to the public authority—the water authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By way of analogy with the privatised system in England and Wales, even within that system the Treasury has retained provision for guaranteeing or underwriting the privatised English and Welsh companies. Despite all its virtues, the free market needs a safety net. It is a ludicrous consequence of having the green dowry, debt write-offs and other aspects of public finance, that we need a safety net. The provision refers to a public sector organisation, at least for the foreseeable future, and as a consequence a guarantee will be provided for debts and liabilities to ensure that if a water authority is corrupt and inefficient, it will have the Government to fall back on. The crucial issue is that the privatised system in England and Wales is still underwritten by the Treasury although it is fully privatised.

What does that mean? If the Government can simply take that cash and determine that the water boards will invest it in the way that the Government wish, that could turn the water boards into little more than a piggy bank for central Government. Why does the Minister think that the clause is necessary? The Secretary of State will have power to take money from the water boards or to tell them how to invest it. That is yet another Government power centralising the financial powers of the water boards. The suspicion will be that the water boards are merely central Government creatures.

I am trying to stick to debating the Bill, Mr. Martin, because the Committee is supposed to be scrutinising it. I hope that it will continue to do so because that is the job of its members.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 608, in page 65, line 39, after '1985)', insert—
	<br><q><p>'which is relevant to or directly related to any of their functions'.</p></q>
Clause 85 brings us to the issue whether the new super-quangos should be able to do anything they wish with taxpayers' money and also the money that is raised in charges. It raises the issue of diversification. The English and Welsh experience has been a nightmare for anyone who would want water and sewerage companies to stick to their core activities. About 200 diversifications have been indulged in by the English and Welsh companies, which range widely from core activities to television and leisure pursuits. Significant investments have been made in companies abroad, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to empower the three quangos to be involved only in operations that are related directly to their core activities. The amendment is reasonable, and I hope that the Minister acknowledges that we do not want the effort of the water authorities diluted by their indulging with taxpayers' money in anything that they wish. The English experience must be examined carefully because what is happening is a scandal and an outrage. We tabled the amendment to obtain the Government's opinion on how serious they are about the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be possible for the water authorities in Scotland to follow the Welsh experience of going into plumbing insurance and hotel management?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is no. I shall explain the position in greater detail. I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Fife, Central that the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1827</span>
new water authorities should not use the provisions in clause 85, which allow them to form companies, to engage in activities that are obviously far removed from the core functions of providing water and sewerage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of examples of investment in non-core activities by pics south of the border. That, of course, is an entirely reasonable and proper activity for them. They are private companies answerable to their shareholders. In all of that, the core functions of the English and Welsh pics are protected. That is one of the functions of the Director General of Water Services. The position in Scotland is different. We are not privatising water. New authorities will be public bodies and, therefore, no risks will be taken with public funds. The consent of the Secretary of State would not be forthcoming for anything of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the whole of clause 85 is about the subsidiary powers of the new authorities. Any activities undertaken under the clause must be in support of or connected with their main functions. There is no question of the powers under the clause being used to extend private interests in the water and sewerage industry as some sort of substitute for privatisation. Nevertheless, it is right that powers to form companies along with the other subsidiary powers of clause 85 should be available to the new authorities. I assure members of the Committee that there is nothing sinister in the provision; it is well precedented and will provide useful and necessary flexibility in the management and operation of the new authorities. I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. His remarks were interesting. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was saying "shame" during his hon. Friend's speech. We know that he is in favour of privatisation and, therefore, he regrets that the boards will not have such power. As the Minister was talking, I was trying to envisage what sort of companies would need to be set up. Does he have any idea at all about that? I cannot see any purpose in the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will have to be involved in activities that bear on the main powers and duties of the public water authorities and the functions that they carry out. I repeat that it is not the Secretary of State's policy that the new authorities, as public bodies, should move into areas that are beyond their core functions or which would expose them to commercial risk. The Secretary of State's consent for any such venture would have to be sought and would not be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a wholly unconvincing assurance. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley wanted examples—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such examples include research and development, consultancy and laboratory services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain wholly unconvinced about the safeguards that have to be built into the clause. Experience of the privatised system elsewhere shows that water
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1828</span>
authorities have set up private companies detached from the core activities. English and Welsh water companies are involved in solid waste, overseas water, pipelines, laboratories, leisure, property, fish farming, plumbing, finance, mineral water, construction, water-related equipment, power generation, surveying partnerships, scientific instrumentation, domestic insurance and insurance of plumbing systems. That seems a fairly comprehensive list of potential investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must warn the Minister that the clause would give the power to move the water authorities' functions and responsibilities into the private sector without further legislation. We are not talking about public companies, but about private companies, directly set up, acting jointly with other companies or individuals. Will the Minister give an assurance that this will not be used as a back door method of privatisation without primary legislation coming before the House? That is the real fear. A pandora's box is lurking in the clause which allows private interests and capital to come in—at arm's length initially—and then to carry out the dirty deed that we believe to be in hand—the eventual privatisation of our water and sewerage services. The Minister may wish to comment on that, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DISSOLUTION OF CENTRAL SCOTLAND WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This raises an important issue for my constituency among others. The Bill makes provision for the dissolution of the Central Scotland water development board and it implies that the assets will be transferred to the new East of Scotland water authority. Why does the Bill not make specific provision for the transfer, since it would be inappropriate for the two main water resources in central Scotland—Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond—to be under the control of a single water authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Central Scotland water development board has responsibility for a substantial proportion of the water resources in central Scotland. It was constituted, following the 1967 Act, for the purpose of
	<br><q><p>"developing new sources of water supply for the purpose of giving a supply of water in bulk to two or more of the water authorities whose limits of supply are comprised in the area of the board".</p></q>
One of the Government's principal objectives in creating the board was to ensure the provision of a substantial reserve of water throughout central Scotland so that supplies could readily be made available at short notice to meet extra demands as they arose in central and eastern areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board's limit of supply was defined as a result of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and currently
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1829</span>
includes Tayside, Fife, Lothian, Central and Strathclyde regional councils. The board abstracts water from its sources—currently Loch Lomond and Loch Turret—and, after treatment, delivers it to convenient points for distribution by the receiving authority. Operating expenses and other costs are currently shared between constituent authorities in accordance with what has been called the apportionment scheme. The total volume of raw water available as bulk supplies from the board is 118.75 million gallons a day—100 million gallons from Loch Lomond and the remainder from Loch Turret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Ihave been patient with the hon. Gentleman, but if he continues to read from documents, I shall have to make a ruling and I am reluctant to do so. I am giving more than a broad hint that the hon. Gentleman should not read from documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was always one to take a hint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the board's existing installations will be located, as described in schedule 8, in the Eastern water area. As the Minister knows, that area is currently outwith the geographical area of the four constituent regions but has always been supplied from the Central region and is currently included as an added area to Central region with respect to supply. The board's main treatment works and control centre is located at Balmore. I do not know whether the Minister has been there, but it is an impressive set-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend been there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would he like to go there now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Balmore is within the new Eastern water area. The only significant element of the board's plant that will lie outwith the Eastern water area will be the Blairlinnans treatment works which currently supplies treatment for water supplied to the Strathclyde region. That is as sensitive to us as certain aspects of Ayrshire are to my hon. Friend. The board has installed a sophisticated electronic control system. I understand from Mr. Gus Ferguson and others that the investment in that now amounts to between a third and a quater of the total investment in all the plant and pumping stations under the board's control and that all operations are remotely controlled and automated from Balmore. In addition to minimising the manual operating costs, that integrated control system enables the complete system of pumps, pipelines, treatment works and storage tanks to operate with optimum efficiency. To ensure continuing economies in this area of bulk water supply, it is important that all units remain under the control of one authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have been very patient, Mr. Martin. My question is will that remain in the control of one authority? Do the Government accept the technical opinion that I have tried to outline? All properties, rights and liabilities should be transferred to the Eastern water authority, including those elements of plant and equipment located at present within
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1830</span>
the Western water authority. The two most significant sources of water are Lochs Katrine and Lomond. Although geographically located in the East of Scotland water authority area, water from Loch Katrine has always been used for supplies to the West of Scotland water area and doubtless to Springburn, although Springburn used to have its own water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that all rights and liabilities in that connection should be transferred to the West of Scotland water authority area, thus giving access to the full yield from the source, which is 100 million gallons a day. I refer to pipe work from the West of Scotland area. The yield is the same as Loch Lomond, the bulk of which will be utilised in the Eastern area. Accordingly, it is equitable that the Loch Lomond resource should be allocated to the East of Scotland water area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those important matters, the Government must have a view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is about to consign the Central Scotland water development board to history. Before it does, would it be in order to congratulate and thank the members of staff on the councils which ran the board? Even opponents to joint boards must accept that that board had an outstanding record in service provision. Before it disappears, that should be put on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give full praise to the officials who have been running the Central Scotland water board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the new structure which the Bill puts in place, there is no continuing need for the Central Scotland water development board. The new authorities will be of a size to ensure that they are able to develop their own dedicated supplies without having to rely on bulk supplies from elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The staff and assets of the board will be transferred in accordance with the arrangements which will apply generally. The East of Scotland water authority will act as the successor authority—which is important to the hon. Gentleman—for certain legal and accounts purposes, and the board's assets, we have concluded, will be appropriately allocated as follows: the Loch Turret scheme and the Loch Lomond scheme to the East authority, along with the pumping station at Ross Priory, the River Leven barrage, the Balmore section, its treatment works, pumping stations and trunk mains. To the West authority will be allocated the Blairlinnans pumping main, its treatment works and other installations downstream of the surge tank at Ross Priory. The River Tay site will go to the East authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I read out that list fairly quickly but I think that it is a reasonably fair explanation of what the Department has decided. We held informal talks with the development board although we have not reached agreement. We cannot go as far as that because of the councillor boycott which has made discussion rather difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister explained that the Loch Turret scheme, which is wholly within Tayside, will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1831</span>
transferred to the new East water board area. That means that Tayside itself, which will go to the Northern water board area, will lose a valuable asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Loch Turret scheme currently serves about 25,000 people who live wholly within the Tayside area. It also serves several rural towns in the area, not least Auchterarder, the home of Jimmy Shand—I know that that is dear to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside regional council believes that there is no reason whatever why Loch Turret should be transferred to the new East authority. In fact, it believes that there is a sound economic case for Loch Turret remaining within Tayside and the Northern area water board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The finance department of Tayside regional council has examined the financial implications for the new area water boards and suggested the likely charges for water, based on the Government's proposals as contained in the Bill and as explained to the Committee by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The finance division believes that if assets such as Loch Turret are not transferred to the new Northern water board, the Eastern water board could have a charge of £65 based on the 1993ߝ94 figures, while the Western water board would have a change of £76. The Scottish average would be £74 but the water charge in the new Northern area would be £82 because of the problem of getting water to the highland areas of the new Northern water area board. It is vital for Tayside and for the Northern area water board that Loch Turret be allowed to remain within Tayside. If the Minister cannot give me a commitment that the Government will reconsider the issue, I shall have to consider tabling a new clause at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but I am informed that the Turret scheme largely serves Grangemouth, so it would not affect the supply of water to Tayside. However, I shall consider what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the transfer of property and rights to the new authorities from the local authorities. It is necessary for the new water authorities to have such property as is directly required for the provision of water and sewerage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are incidental properties and rights such as those which were discussed under clause 64: access for fishing, boating and yachting on water-related properties. Is there anything to prevent the Secretary of State's scheme for the transfer of properties to make it possible for local authorities to retain recreational rights rather than transfer them to the new water authorities? Such rights and properties are not directly required for water and sewerage services. It would be appropriate and in the public interest of they were to remain in the ownership of elected local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain how the system would operate. It would be for the local authorities as the appropriate bodies to make the transfer schemes because they have knowledge and expertise. The duty would be on the local authorities to prepare the transfer schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funding has been made available for 1994ߝ95—£1 million in local government settlement—and the position for the year following will be examined in due course. The Government are aiming for maximum continuity and if there is a tradition of fishing a reservoir, there is no reason why that should not be allowed to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful. I take it from what the Minister said that it would be possible for the local authorities, in having their input to the drafting of the transfer schemes, to make the case for such fishing and recreation rights to be retained by them because they have nothing to do with the provision of water services. I welcome that an I am grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that. I was very careful with the words that I used.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed:</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where property is transferred to a new water and sewerage authority, the Bill provides that the initial transfer right of pre-emption on the previous owner's right to buy back and similar rights shall not operate. When such a right is removed, compensation will be payable by the local authority or the new water and sewerage authorities. As the benefits of such a transfer will be enjoyed solely by the new water and sewarage authorities, will they alone be responsible for compensation payments? When compensation is not paid, does the responsibility for making the payments rest with the new water and sewerage authorities? Is that the hang of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is. notes on clauses confirm that, under subsection (7), if there is a dispute about compensation, such as on the amount to be paid, to whom it should be paid or which authorities should pay, the matter shall be referred to the Lord President of the Court of Session. However, the transfer scheme will cover the type of issues that the hon. Gentleman raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When land is transferred between the current regional and island councils and the new water authorities, clause 88 provides that any existing rights over that land, such as pre-emption or irritancy rights, will not operate as a result of the transfer. That is appropriate, given that the land will remain in the public sector and will be used for the same purpose as under its previous ownership. However, in some circumstances, existing rights of that kind may no longer be exercisable as a result of the transfer. In those cases, it is fair that the loss of those rights is compensated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 590, in page 72, leave out lines 1 to 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 90 relates to the Secretary of State's power to require information and assistance in respect of water and sewerage transfer schemes. The amendment would delete a significant part of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the amendment. I hope that regional and islands councils will willingly and thoroughly prepare transfer schemes and afford the Secretary of State all the information that he needs to satisfy himself that progress is being made, and eventually to approve the submitted schemes. We cannot, however, ignore the contrary indications which have come from COSLA in particular, as shown by its boycott of co-operation on these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress again that I hope and believe that it will not be necessary to make use of these powers, but it would be a dereliction of duty on the part of the Scottish Office not to ensure that the powers were there, given the indications of non-co-operation that we have witnessed and which I hope are of a temporary nature.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather from the Minister that the policy of not providing information is hurting the Government, and I hope that that continues. No one in Scotland wants this half-baked reorganisation of local government and the water and sewerage services. I think that the Government are attempting to ensure that common sense prevails among local authorities and the Scottish people so that the appropriate information is provided. The clause is a sign of the Government's desperation. It gives them powers to use if the local authorities do no co-operate. The local authorities are in the right and the Government are in the wrong.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 405, in page 73, line 44, at end add—
	<br><q><p>'(3) A new water and sewerage authority shall not dispose of land under subsection (1) before—

</ol></p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the disposal of land. This is an interesting group of amendments, supported by the Scottish Landowners Federation and the Scottish Consumer Council. The Bill gives the new authorities an almost completely unfettered discretion to dispose of land. In practice, that is qualified by the duties laid down in clause 64(2) to have regard to environmental and conservation issues and to the preservation of public access. However, the Scottish Consumer Council suggests that it would be appropriate to refer any proposed sale to the customers council. If consultation and co-operation are to be anything more than tokenism, that is a reasonable idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the council could not approve any proposed sale, the matter should be referred to the Secretary of State for a final decision. As sales of land are sales of public assets, it would be appropriate, in the absence of any democratic accountability—an issue that we have stressed—to involve the customers council in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about how much confidence there will be in the three new water super-quangos. In the absence of democratic accountability, we are trying to create a chain of events which will allow an organisation—whose members, although still hand picked by the Secretary of State, are nevertheless one step removed—to oversee that process and ensure that the public interest is not sacrificed for private interests. Some of the clauses that have been debated today allow private companies to be established. Will there be a private company to look after land containing beautiful lochs and other assets? If so, land disposal would be linked to a private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a range of concerns that could best be covered by building another safeguard into the system. That is the main thrust of amendments Nos. 405 and 406.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision grants the Government wide powers. The land should not be the subject of a sale of the century. It is important that the massive land bank that the water authorities will control is not scattered to the winds but is used to benefit consumers. We are considering public assets that were not created by the Government but by generations of local government taxpayers. I hope that the Minister understands that people are worried that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1836</span>
assets will be allowed to drift away. They should continue to perform a function for the water services. The amendment suggests that the Government or the water board should not dispose of assets that they have commandeered without allowing some public input. That is reasonable. The customers council would provide an outside, customer-oriented voice. Why should that not happen? Why cannot the Government accept the amendment and thus permit some connection with the public, who created the assets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Angus, East have made important points. We are all interested in the water authorities' assets, especially lochs, woodlands and conservation areas that are important to recreation in Scotland. The Bill includes clauses that take care of the interests of rural areas. New clause 46, or was it 48—we are progressing so fast that I cannot keep up—made specific recommendations for nature conservation areas and sites of special scientific interest. However, we should not fetter the new water authorities with too many rules and regulations about managing the water authority estate. They will carry out their duties with great responsibility; they will look after their assets; they will have to discuss sales with the district valuer. If an effort is made to dispose of land at less than the market price, the Secretary of State's approval will be required. He will take a close interest in any such application. I appreciate hon. Members' anxieties. However, it is not appropriate to accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Fife, Central will accept my explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EMPTYING OF SEPTIC TANKS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 343, in page 74, line 41, leave out
	<br><q><p>'and (b) to all proper charges for their doing so being timeously paid'.</p></q>
Perhaps I may plunge the Committee into the question of septic tanks. Clause 97 qualifies the duty on the authorities to empty septic tanks. I do not think that there should be a qualification; they should have an unfettered duty to do so because water and sewerage authorities will wish to ensure, for public health reasons, that the tanks are timeously emptied to avoid the risk of pollution and threat to public health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless subsection 10(1)(b) is omitted, as our amendment No. 343 proposes, there would be no duty to empty septic tanks where an authority could show that proper charges for its doing so had not been timeously paid. That is a small and inconsequential matter. I do not say that it should not be pursued, or that people should be allowed the service without paying for it. Septic tanks should be emptied as a matter of duty and the charges pursued through the courts in due time, otherwise there could be all sorts of consequences, and pollution and public health risks could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good reason for the Government to consider carefully accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I again declare a personal interest. Existing legislation gives permissive powers to regional councils to empty septic tanks. Most Scottish councils provide this service free of charge with reasonable frequency. The proposed legislation in clause 97 is such that the service must be paid for at the rate of the actual cost of the work. This will mean that there will be no free septic tank emptying. Furthermore, the cost to isolated properties remote from tanker depots will be much higher than for properties close to centres of population. An intolerable financial burden would be placed on crofters and remote householders. Does not the Minister consider this to be a rather unfair aspect of the proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian will not be the hardest hit region, but remote areas of my constituency will be. Lothian provides a free emptying service once a year and any additional emptying is made on the basis of an hourly chare. The area of Lothian region is relatively small compared with Highland region, which also gives a free emptying service, but levies a standard charge to all householders inrrespective of geographical location. What is the Government's attitude to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take a great interest in it because, as the hon. Gentleman knows, very many Scottish houses have septic tanks. He is right to say that all but Tayside regional council empty septic tanks from time to time free of charge; Tayside makes a small charge. When the water authorities come into being, people with septic tanks will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1838</span>
not pay the sewerage charge, a proportion of costs that is rather hidden in council tax now. It will be deducted from their bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be necessary for the authorities to empty septic tanks at reasonable periods. There is a reasonable power, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, whereby if the sewerage authority serves notice on the owner of a septic tank to remedy any defects, and he fails to do so, it may carry out the work itself and recover expenses from the owner. To safeguard public health, local authorities have power under the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897—there were septic tanks at that time—to require the emptying of a septic tank that is causing a nuisance. I doubt that there will be any question of people being allowed to get away with using decaying septic tanks. It is, of course, very important that they be maintained to a high standard and emptied from time to time. All such matters will be discussed in detail by the customers council, which will advise the water authorities on the emptying of septic tank. That is a most important part of their duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>'(3) In respect of the power of subsection (2) no powers shall be exercised outside Scotland.'.</p></q>
The amendment is extremely important. That is not why I am moving it. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central has been responsible for piloting our work on the Bill through Committee. He has done extremely well, with meticulous planning and fine attention to detail. Having done the job for another team leader last year I know how difficult, wearing and taxing it can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, which allows for supply for water outwith Scotland, is remarkable, but not in its assumption of a market for Scottish water outside Scotland—one has only to work in London during the week to realise the benefits of living in Scotland regarding drinking water—nor because of a lack of a surplus of water that we could usefully sell to the English. Last weekend made us aware of a huge surplus, though it does not have fizz, and I do not know whether the English will be able to drink it without its being carbonated. It was certainly chilled last weekend. Those facts do not explain why the clause is remarkable. It is remarkable because it provides that
	<br><q><p>"a water authority may exercise, either within or outwith their limits of supply, the like powers with respect to laying mains or breaking open roads as are exercisable by them under this Act for the purpose of laying mains, but subject to the like conditions and obligations."</p></q>
The meaning of that clause—which English Conservative Members should consider carefully—is that if the three super-quangos are so minded, they can roam the streets of those hon. Members' constituencies tearing up the roads to lay mains so that they can sell Scottish water there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) is close to the border, so he should beware. The Water (Scotland) Act 1980 contains draconian measures in relation to the authorities' powers to tear up roads and lay mains. It would be unusual for the authorities to have those powers south of the border, but clause 102 provides for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may refer us to clause 169(3). If he does not, he should do and I am sure that a piece of paper will be handed to him to that effect. Clause 169(3), which we shall discuss at the last gasp of the Bill, states:
	<br><q><p>"This Act shall extend to Scotland only."</p></q>
Clause 102(2) contradicts clause 169(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an early stage I raised with senior Clerks of the House the fact that that might invalidate the Bill, which was certified in the beginning as exclusively relating to Scotland. Clause 102 states that it is not confined to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should get his facts right before he misleads us. The infrastructure in clause 102 means inside Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1840</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what clause 102 states. I have checked carefully. Clause 102, in relation to the appropriate parts of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980, makes clear that the powers in that Act can be applied south of the border or, presumably, in Northern Ireland, or perhaps even in Denmark if it were willing to accept sovereignty through the European Community. However, I make the point as it applies south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that clause 102(2) gives powers outwith the borders of Scotland. Amendment No. 581 would take the Government off the hook. It would make clear, just as the Minister made clear this morning with his promise about the new clause and disconnections, that the contradiction that apparently exists between clauses 102 and 169 would be eliminated. Therefore, I look forward to the Government accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, but regret that amendments which I tabled were not selected. It is bad enough that oil supplies are going without water assets following them, especially without benefit to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What benefit will the provision give to Scottish consumers? I believe that the Scottish boards should concentrate all their energies on providing a high-quality, low-cost water service for Scottish consumers. That excellent objective should take up all their energies, without their being embroiled in anything else. Will the Minister explain in detail the reasons for those new powers, which are certainly new? Added to the powers elsewhere in the Bill to allow the water boards to form companies and to the constriction on the boards to make money, the clause takes on an entirely new and commercial tone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want that to happen. I would prefer the boards to concentrate on producing the best quality water for consumers in Scotland. I regret that my amendments were not selected because their principle was that profits made from selling water firth of Scotland would be reinvested for the benefit of Scottish consumers, whether in improved infrastructure, in lower prices or in better services. Profits or benefits from the sale of Scottish water should be returned to Scottish consumers. An earlier clause allows the Government to syphon off profits or moneys if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Profits—which the Government clearly have in mind—should benefit Scottish consumers who, after all, are paying for the assets used and will continue to pay for any new assets that are added to the boards. If the companies enter into commercial contracts, they will be legally bound and will have to fulfil those contracts. Is not there a possibility that if there are problems at home, Scottish consumers will not get priority when commercial contracts have first call on water services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 102 refers to the supply of water for use outside Scotland. I shall not rehearse the arguments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1841</span>
that were advanced before the break. I regret that you, Mr. Martin, did not select my amendments. They would have made it clear that, if water was to be sold outside Scotland, it should be done so at commercial rates. Any profits should be used immediately to improve infrastructure, lower the prices and improve the services in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister what priority Scottish consumers will receive. If the boards enter into contracts south of Scotland, they will be legally bound commercially to fulfil those contracts. The clause seems to betray something of a similar concern, when it states:
	<br><q><p>"A water authority may, if for the time being they are satisfied that such supplies of water as are available to them".</p></q>
So only surplus supplies of water can be made available outside Scotland. That is fair enough, but when contracts are entered into, they probably cannot be altered or broken. What safeguards will exist whereby Scottish consumers would receive priority from the Scottish water boards? After all, profit will be the main springboard and motive, and secrecy will apply to how they conduct their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments would have ensured that the sale of water would have been undertaken at commercial rates and that any profits or benefits stemming from such sales would have been guaranteed for the use of Scottish consumers. After all, the Scottish public will have paid for the assets that will be used by the public body and, therefore, should receive the benefits. That is what I should like to see carried out, and I would like to know what the Minister has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have a sneaking suspicion that the trading outside Scotland that is permitted in the Bill works both ways in that the assets so created would be perfect for takeover in the future perhaps by English or other private water companies. I gues that that will be the next stage in this particular drama. We will see a glimpse of the future in relation to the assurances that have been given in the Committee, which will gather dust in 	<i>Hansard,</i> a copy of which will be stuck on a shelf somewhere, unless the Scottish electorate decide to take a hand, which could result in a different scenario.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the debate. The hon. Member for Angus, East really must stop finding difficulties in every solution. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said earlier that Scotland was a mass of surplus water. He did not say, but he implied that there was sufficient water for it to be sold elsewhere if it were genuinely surplus. Surely he and other members of the Committee agree that it is important that Scottish customers should be supplied first at the most reasonable price available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that, while we have an incredible amount of water as a result of a very high rainfall, we do not have tremendous storage capacity. Too often, we know that it only takes about a two or three weeks' drought to result in no hosing of gardens, no washing of cars and water engineers becoming worried. If water were to be sold outwith Scotland, it would be sold only if it were genuinely surplus to any requirement at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1842</span>
Having had a little time to refresh my mind on the legal position, I wish to clarify a matter for the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). He suggested that clause 102 allows the new water authorities to undertake operations outside Scotland. I am advised that it does not. It can take the water to the border, but it cannot go an inch further than that other than to sell it at the border. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> There is much better water at Gretna Green.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 102 will insert a new provision into the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 and that Act applies only within Scotland. The clause empowers authorities to make agreements to sell surplus water—I stress surplus water—to people outside Scotland. That is not inconsistent with the Act which applies in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the clause gives the new authorities power to lay pipes and so on in connection with those agreements to supply water for use outside Scotland. Those are the same powers as they have to lay mains. Those powers may be exercised within or without the authority—from the East to the West, the North to the East or the North to the West—as required, but certainly within Scotland. The North authority could lay pipes through the West authority to facilitate a sale of water for use in England. I must say that, living in the valley of Annandale where we are knee-deep in oil, water and gas pipes and electricity transmission lines, I wonder whether there would be any room for any further water pipes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers can be used outside the North authority but must be exercised within Scotland. That is because the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 does not extend beyond Scotland. Any pipeline in England can only be used by a person with the correct authority to carry out such work in England. I hope that that explains the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, the matter should not cause great concern. I do not recognise the power as one that will be extensively used because it would be expensive to transport water from main storage areas such as Loch Lomond or central Scotland—there is a surplus in south-west Scotland and in the east. It is unlikely that the power would be used, but it would be useful in case it could be of assistance to the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mind boggles. The clause provides a power to water authorities in Scotland to build a water pipeline to take our surplus water south of the border. I have no doubt about the premium rate that the hon. Member for Angus, East wants, but it stops at the border. Although I joked from a sedentary position that we would have a row of stand pipes across the border from Gretna Green to Berwick-upon-Tweed because the water authorities would have the power to trip up the fields, pavements and roads as far as the English borders but absolutely not beyond, that is what will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a little experience of this, because I have an English water supply in one of my fields.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 47—	<i>Legal basis for laying mains and sewers</i>—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>'(1) Where a new water and sewerage authority in exercise of their powers wish to lay a main or a sewer in on or over land not forming part of a road, the authority may in the absence of agreement between the authority and the owner and occupier of such land, seek a compulsory rights order in terms of section 12 of the Pipelines Act 1962</li>
	<li>(2) For the purposes of sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Pipelines Act 1962, "pipeline" shall include a water main, drain and sewer.'.</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must detain the Committee for a few moments on a technical but important matter. I believed that the new clause was a good one until the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) decided to join me in tabling it. This is probably the end of my career. He and other hon. Members have taken an interest in it and it covers an important matter on which we must spend some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a legal point of view I am nervous about introducing new provisions which do not observe the normal practice in land rights and land use in which servitude rights of access and other legal agreements are entered into when pipeline access or any sort of wayleave have been created in the past. The Bill does not observe the convention and is defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other issues arising relate to the impact on the rights of landowners. In some combinations of circumstances onerous situations could arise concerning the duties and liabilities of water authorities and landowners. The new clause has rather rough and ready recourse to the Pipe-lines Act 1962, which might be a somewhat blunt instrument. I certainly have no intention of seeking to cause undue delay in the laying of new pipelines, or to impose any extra costs on the new water authorities for the new work that they will carry forward under the Bill, but I think that the Minister should say a few words about some of the issues. I know that he has had meetings, as is right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V006P0I1020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

and proper, and I hope that he may have had time for further thoughts which he could share with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can identify with much of what the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has said. The clause maintains the status quo. We are being offered the opportunity to bring water pipes into line with other pipes such as oil pipes or gas pipes, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary mentioned. The Bill gives full rein to the new water authorities to lay the pipes as they wish, as has been the case in the past. The new clause gives them recourse to compulsory rights, so that they would have entitlement to provide essential pipelines to local commuities or other users whenever needed. The National Farmers Union has made a good case in pushing for wayleaves, which are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee long. I talked to my hon. Friend the Minister and to the Scottish Landowners Federation about this issue before the Bill was published. It is of particular concern to my constituents, since mine is a large rural constituency. That concern was probably aggravated by the consultation document. The photograph in figure 8 of page 14, entitle "Water main laying", shows the large excavations necessary for water main laying which can damage farm land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am indebted to the Scottish Landowners Federation for bringing a current case to my attention. Mr. and Mrs. Laing from Denny in Stirlingshire—no relation to the friends of the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley—have a 140 acre dairy farm. A section of it was compulsorily purchased for a water plant and approximately 30 more acres are temporarily sterilised by the laying of pipes, which means that it will be three or four years before their land will recover. Under the 1980 Act, compensation is given for injurious affection to the land, but the situation causes crippling damage to the owner's business. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take into account compensation for loss of profitability in any legislation to do with water main laying. I hope that he will give serious consideration to the implications and the disruption to the many farmers in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I delcare my interest as a member of the Scottish Landowners Federation and I know only too well the problems that face farmers with major pipelines across their land. I had two fields that looked like the battle of Passchendaele during the first world war after a relatively small main had been laid. My goodness, what a mess it made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to add a provision allowing a landowner to ask a sheriff to consider a case before the right to go through land is accepted. That is extended to sewers—at present, it is possible to take water through land without using the Pipelines Act. It s extended to sewers because they are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and my hon. Friends the Members for Ayr
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1846</span>
and for Kincardine and Deeside carefully, and we shall, with commitment, reconsider the matter before Report to see whether we can stiffen up the legislation in the interests of landowners. I appreciate that it is a singularly inconvenient operation, given the fact that we must bear in mind the importance to the community of putting a pipeline or sewer through land. Often there are no alternative routes available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

amendments are technical. The clause is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. My amendments will make sense to the experts, if to no one else. I do not know how the water authorities would have any way of knowing who the owners might be or how they would know of the route or the condition of the private supply. The term "reasonable repair" is not defined. Pumping stations are not referred to. There are instances in my constituency of a conjunction between private and public supply and the public supply tops up the private supply. That is not catered for in the clause. It is not right that the customers council has no role to play. For those reasons, and many others, clause 105 requires further scrutiny by the Minister before he can be confident that he is enacting a clause that is not substantially defective in a number of respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 24 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 defines local authority responsibility as being to the boundary of the street in which the main is laid, which is very important. The Bill proposes that that responsibility should be extended to the curtilage of the building supplied and imposes a duty on the authority to take over ownership and maintain lengths of supply pipes of unknown condition within three months of an appointed day unless the pipe can be shown to be in an unsatisfactory condition. That will impose a significant burden on the authorities. Would not it be more equitable for owners to be required to submit plans and details of pipe works, condition and material along with a request that they be adopted by the authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has covered a great deal. I wish to add that many of the supply pipes serve properties above the level at which they can be supplied by gravity from the mains. In such circumstances, the owner provides and operates a private pumping station, often at the point of connection. It would be preferable if such pumping stations were not to vest in the water authority nor in the pipework between the pumping station and the curtilage of the property being supplied. To avoid doubt, this should be covered by a specific provision. Will the Minister come back to this later after studying what the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and I have said. If pumping stations were to vest their conditions, there would have to be reasonable time. This implies a duty to ensure that standby pipes and electrical arrangements meet current safety and operational requirements, and necessitates telemetry for remote monitoring performance. You have been patient, Mr. Martin. I hope that I have made my point and that the Minister will agree to consider this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is complicated. A new responsibility is being put on the water authorities in terms of vesting pipelines. I understand, too, the difficulties that water authorities, and, indeed private owners, have in assessing the standard and quality of the pipe between the main and the curtilage of a house. It may vary enormously. There may be lead pipes, which should not be there in any case. The pipes may be of the wrong guage, or in a sorry state of repair. Water authorities will need time to sort out those things before they take over and accept
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1848</span>
responsibility for the pipeline. The clause provides for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the appropriate time, I shall move Government amendments in my name which add a number of provisions to section 24 of the 1980 Act. Their purpose is to permit water authorities to take over certain supply pipelines. Present drafting requires such pipes to be in a reasonable state of repair before vesting in the water authority takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been pointed out to us in discussions that a pipeline may not be suitable for vesting. For example, it may be constructed of inappropriate size, and material, or be insufficiently well buried. These issues will be dealt with by our amendments at the appropriate time.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would provide an extra safeguard for the consumer. Any meters installed must be installed at the openly and fairly expressed wish of both the owner and the occupier of the premises involved. The Government are fond of putting catch-all clauses in the Bill. I am having a bash at doing the same on the consumer's behalf. The amendments would allow maximum freedom of action for both owners and occupiers of premises over meter installation. Water boards could only act at their behest over the metering option. To that extent, the amendments are a straightforward extra safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gathers his notes, perhaps I can assist the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The option for all consumers of public water supplies to take their water by meter if they want to was made available for the first time by an amendment to the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 which we included in the Local Government Finance Act 1992. That provision contained a right of appeal to the Secretary of State for consumers where they considered terms and conditions set by the water authority to be unreasonable.

I cannot believe that it is in the best interests of consumers to remove existing appeal rights to the Secretary of State. Under amendment No. 648, anyone with an unresolved dispute over whether the terms and conditions for metering supplies set by the water authority were unreasonable would have to pursue the matter in court. That might deter people from considering metering as an option. As a result, it would act against widening consumer choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 441 would introduce a role for the customers council in considering appeals about the terms and conditions under which a new water authority is prepared to offer a metered water supply. Reference is made in the clause to the charges associated with such a supply. The charges relate to the costs of installing the meter and not to the charges for the supply of water. They might be included in new section 41A(b) to the 1980 Act proposed in the clause but an amendment in schedule 13 removes them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges for metered supply will be as set out in the charges scheme which the customers council will have already considered, so its role in that sense is secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt that there is a role here for the council. Many appeals about charges for fittings or other terms and conditions concering the metered water supply may be technical issues on which the customers council will not have the appropriate expertise. Also, there is already a well established appeal mechanism to the Secretary of

State which will continue under the new arrangements. That has worked well and should not be disturbed at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 107 provides for occupiers with the consent of owners to opt for a metered water supply. Both must agree. In this respect amendment No. 573 is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments may be to introduce a safeguard against compulsory metering. Here again, amendment is unnecessary. The current position remains unchanged. Non-domestic premises in general can be required to have meters. Domestic premises, save in the exceptional circumstances set out in section 51 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980, cannot. It is right to maintain the current position. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I anticipate some problems, especially in rural areas, where it will be established that existing private water supplies are not suitable. I should be grateful if the Minister would let us know—if not now, later—how many such supplies there are, how many buildings in Scotland depend on such private supplies, how many of those supplies have been tested and how many will have to be brought up to standard or replaced with a new public water supply to overcome that problem, which is likely to be significant in some rural areas.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the matter speedily. We should separate the interests of national security from civil emergencies. The clause should allow a water and sewerage authority to liaise with a local authority in order to arrange to mitigate the effect of a civil emergency.

Secondly, with respect to civil emergencies, there is a need to install a facility for the Secretary of State to give direction at the request of local authorities. That, too, is absent from the clause. Will the Minister examine those omissions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a duty of reasonableness should be added to the requirement that authorities and assessors provide information to water sewerage authorities; and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1855</span>
perhaps they should have the right to charge for any work done in supplying information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely unusual for a democratically elected local authority to be required by statute to provide information to non-elected quangos. If such a requirement is to be made, it would seem only fair that an element of reasonableness is included so that authorities are not engaged in time-consuming tasks in providing the water and sewerage authority with information which, while interesting, may be of little purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the financial constraints under which all local authorities operate, the authority providing the information should be allowed to charge for the efforts undertaken to supply the information. It seems strange that at a time when the Government are requiring local authorities to be ever more efficient and put out their services to compulsory competitive tendering, they should also require them to provide information to another corporate body free of charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will be good co-operation between the water authorities and the local authorities and that it will be unnecessary for the Secretary of State to lay any orders because the authorities will make the information available.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be difficult to say off the cuff how many orders would have to be laid following the legislation. However, most of them will probably be negative orders. [Hon. Members: "Shame."] Hon. Members say "shame", but they know exactly what that means. They can pray against orders. Everyone knows how impossible it is to get the time to put a series of affirmative orders through this place. Many hon. Members would like to have affirmative orders, but in practical terms it is far better to proceed by negative orders and pray against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a disgraceful answer. There will be dozens of orders of fundamental and central importance to a major public utility. It is not good enough for the Minister to say, "Oh well, dear, dear. We would never get through them all unless they were all negative orders because they will clutter up the system." The Government should not put through legislation requiring so much secondary legislation without ensuring that there is parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister's answer highlights the need for a Scottish Parliament to examine such issues. Exhausted at the end of the day, we claim, "Well, we really don't have time to consider these matters properly", that undermines the principle of democracy. It illustrates the case for decentralisation. That case will be won at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is typical of the hon. Gentelman to misinterpret my words. He knows that if every measure was subject to further regulation through secondary legislation by affirmative order, the system would grind to a halt. I cannot say off the cuff how many orders will be subject to affermative or negative procedure. If the majority was to be subject to affirmative procedure, even the hon. Gentleman would shout about the number of hours that he would have to spend on the orders. By and large, the system works well. Hon. Members have clear opportunities to pray against an order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
