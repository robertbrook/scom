	<time>Thursday 3 March 1994</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I do not wish to detain the Committee, but my point of order relates to page ix of the explanatory and financial memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an obligation on the Government to include in each Bill laid before Parliament an assessment of the effect of the Bill on public service manpower. All Governments take seriously that important obligation. As this Bill relates, in many instances, to 300,000 people employed in local authorities in Scotland, that factor is crucial. The element of the financial and explanatory memorandum relating to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Effect of the Bill on Public Service Manpower"</p></blockquote>
states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>Part I</i> will abolish one tier of local government resulting in an estimated reduction in local government staffing levels of between 700 and 2,200."</p></blockquote>
Much of the Government's argument and calculation is based on that fairly wide estimate. Yesterday, the European Court of Justice made an interim decision, that will effect British law, because directives interpreted by that court take precedence over all British law, including the Bill, should it get through the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that interim judgment, the Advocate General the European Court of Justice, Walter Van Gerven, said that Britain had failed to fulfil its legal obligations on the protection of workers' rights under article V of the treaty of Rome and under Brussels directives 77/187 and 75/129. Those are the transfer of undertakings provisions. They obviously relate to our consideration of the Bill today and make a mockery of the Government's assessment that there will be savings of between 700 and 2,200 in manpower. If that interim judgment stands—and virtually all such judgments become final judgments—the British Government will not be allowed to make that saving in manpower because all local authority staff currently employed will have to be re-engaged under their own existing terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only does that interim judgment relate to consultation with workers' organisations—clearly, the British Government have been found to be specifically in breach of European law—it will effect the transfer of undertakings provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
I suggest that, as that part of the explanatory memorandum which relates to the effect on public service manpower is seriously defective as a consequence of that interim judgment of the European Court, the Government should reconsider whether they wish to proceed with the Bill at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member knows, my responsibility lies with ensuring that the Bill is properly debated in Committee. The memorandum is not a part of the Bill. It is there for purely explanatory reasons. I have no powers in respect of it. Perhaps that helps to explain matters for the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr Martin. We entirely accept your ruling. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr Robertson) has grossly misled—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> In fact, he has made a complete ass of himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a consequence of your ruling, Mr Martin, however, may I make a short statement on the matter to the Committee, not solely for the benefit of members of the Committee, who understand the proceedings, but because the proceedings will be reported outside the Committee and what the hon. Member for Hamilton has said about the Bill is on the public record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful for the good running of the Committee to allow the Minister to do so. Let me stress, however, that my responsibility lies with the Bill, not the explanatory memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for your tolerance, Mr. Martin. There is no question of either the interim or the final judgment affecting the costs of reform. The majority of issues involved have already been incorporated in United Kingdom law by the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. The remaining area of disagreement is a technical procedural matter relating to consultation. It will have no affect on the costs of local government reform in Scotland, irrespective of the final judgment of the European Court of Justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I respect your comments that we should stick to the terms of the Bill, but we heard with disbelief the Minister's comments. The question of finance is germane to clauses 24 and 25. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton raised that issue which, in a sense, is about the order of today's debate. We shall be discussing clauses 24 and 25, which relate to transition costs and capping powers. That is why the issue is so important. We should hope that the Minister would not treat the future of 300,000 employees with utter contempt. He should make a proper statement at a later stage in our proceedings or give an assurance that he will consider the matter and come back with an answer. We reject utterly the Minister's statement this morning, which does not bear examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chariman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point Clause 24 is about finance and its consideration will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
enable hon. Members to debate those matters and for the Minister to rebut the comments that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. As you clearly stated in response to the first point of order, the Committee's duties and responsibilities are laid down under the rules in the House that direct our proceedings, including how we handle matters coming from the European Union—I yield to no one in my interest in how the European Union affects business in the House. There will be ample opportunity under the amendments to clauses 24 and 25 to debate fully matters of finance. Hon. Members will therefore have the chance then to raise those issues. I think that we should get on with our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I turn to more mundane matters. A Conservative councillor from Tayside region has written to me about a comment that I made on 10 February. In the second paragraph of column 201 in the 	<i>Hansard,</i> I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is why Birkhill should remain within Dundee district council. The local Conservative councillors have drawn that fact to the Minister's attention."—[Official Report, 	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 10 February 1994; c. 201.]</p></blockquote>
If that is read in the context of what I said in the previous column, it is clear that I am referring to Birkhill cemetary, not to Birkhill itself. I wish to put the record straight and to assure those councillors in Tayside—I am flattered that they read my speeches with such close attention—that I understand entirely the Conservative view that they want to take advantage of the excellent services provided by Dundee district council, but do not want to pay for them. They want to leave that to Dundee council tax payers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are obliged to discuss two groups of amendments under clause 23 today. Given the lengthy contributions to discussions on clause 23 on Tuesday, the same could happen today. Was not the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) making a prophecy when he said that we should be debating clauses 24 and 25 today? I recall that some time ago I was taken to task by the Speaker on the basis that we should not make prophecies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member knows something that I do not. I am in the hands of the Committee as to what clauses and amendments we reach. I can say that we have now reached amendment No. 177.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 23</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DUTY TO PREPARE DECENTRALISATION SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 177, in page 20, leave out lines 25 to 28.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 178 in page 20, leave out lines 29 and 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish first of all to draw the Minister's attention to his own comments in column 756 on Tuesday. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can give an absolute assurance that in the guidance to local authorities from the Secretary of State points about objectives relating to the involvement of community group representatives, support and consultation with voluntary and community organisations will reflect this debate"—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 1 March 1994; c. 756.]</p></blockquote>
I would like to ask the Minister whether that cast iron assurance, which was given after a lengthy debate, will be taken into account. I am sure that his civil servants and the Minister listened to the debate. If he is prepared to give that assurance, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will there be a debate on clause stand part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) said, we cannot make prophecies. It depends on how long we take to deal with the amendments. Does the hon. Member wish to speak to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never rely on prophecies. I shall ask two concise questions of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first relates to the Secretary of State for Scotland's own backyard in the Stewartry of Kirkudbright. In a letter, John Maxwell, the leader of the council, states that in Scotland the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"has made Education Authorities 	<b>smaller</b> and Housing Authorities 	<b>larger.</b> It is therefore difficult to understand how he expects any improvement in efficiency.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The District Council has no choice other than to accept this position but does feel very strongly that the requirement for the new authorities to produce draft schemes of decentralisation should be mandatory from vesting day and not as laid out in Clause 23 of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
What response are the Government making to the Stewartry of Kirkudbright? The leader of the council is upset that he has not received a proper hearing from his own Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its response to the Government's consultation paper, the Stewartry of Kirkudbright—the very heartland of the Secretary of State's constituency—state the following about the Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is noted with regret that virtually no comment is made in the consultative document about the services and functions which local government does or should do, or indeed even a comment about the essential role local government plays in the democratic society. This is seen as a fundamental flaw in the whole exercise."</p></blockquote>
When an independent council in the Secretary of State's constituency refers to a "fundamental flaw" and it is as dissatisfied as that, my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton is abundantly right to call for the Bill's withdrawal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
My second set of questions again relates to clause 23. Various representations have been made to the Government by John Woods and Friends of the Earth Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I apologise to you, but will you clarify whether we are debating that the clause stand part debate or amendments Nos. 177 and 178?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I pointed out to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), this is not the clause stand part debate, but a debate on the amendments. I like to give hon. Members some lead-in time and that is what I have given the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The second question concerns the approaches that have been made to the Government by Friends of the Earth Scotland. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK Government's strategy on Sustainable Development published in January 1994 sets out the Government's overall response to the Rio conference (UNCED) of June 1992. A wide range of the issues and commitments it contains need to be put into practice by local authorities.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Agenda 21 is one of the key documents agreed at Rio; Chapter 28 specifically addresses the need for local environmental partnerships and programmes, through which local authorities inform and empower local communities.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The European Community Fifth Action Programme on the Environment sets out the EC's environmental strategy. The UK Government is a signatory to this strategy and the raft of measures which it embraces. Many of the measures it contains will be ineffective without local authority action."</p></blockquote>
Friends of the Earth Scotland would have liked there to have been an amendment dealing with carbon dioxide. It wants
	<br><blockquote><p>"local authorities to prepare CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> plans. In order to meet the Government's targets for CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> reduction and support local authorities' own initiatives the amendment makes a formal requirement for Councils to prepare plans. Targets for CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> reduction, which will be essential if it is to succeed, should be agreed in advance between the Secretary of State and Councils (meeting through COSLA)."</p></blockquote>
Do the Government intend to bring forward measures on Report to meet the proposals of Friends of the Earth Scotland? I put the question in interrogative form because I understand that there will be difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is having its second debate about decentalisation. We considered what was almost, but not quite a technical amendment on Tuesday from 10.30 am to 9.45 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a useful debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman attended just 10 per cent. of it. No doubt, he has spent the time since reading 	<i>Hansard.</i> I pay tribute to Opposition Members who made a number of useful contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
The debate was extremely lengthy by any standards and about a point over which there was a difference of view. The difference was, however simple and straightforward; it concerned whether the requirement to consult community groups and involve them in membership should be in the Bill or in the guidance issued by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It took the Committee a day to consider that matter, for reasons which were not entirely clear then and are not entirely clear now. As you will recall, Mr. Martin, you had to draw hon. Members back to a discussion of the amendment on a number of occasions. I accept that it is your decision as to whether there is a clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the question of the guidance that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will give to authorities about decentralisation. It can therefore encapsulate a number of points, including those that the hon. Member for Linlithgow put to me. I shall respond to his two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, my right hon. Friend is a most meticulous and hard-working constituency Member of Parliament. That is widely recognised. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Linlithgow if I have misunderstood him, but his point seemed to be that there should be a statutory requirement on councils to introduce decentralisation schemes from vesting date—April 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is on 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make it clear that I was casting no aspersion on the Secretary of State and his constituency work? I would not do that to a parliamentary colleague. I was simply saying that, on this subject, relations have been unsatisfactory. They are not unsatisfactory in any other respect. However, the district council is very upset about this matter. It was John Maxwell who took the initiative in contacting me. He said in respect of vesting day that the Stewartry district council
	<br><blockquote><p>"contacted 17 other authorities in Scotland who are faced in a similar situation as far as reorganisation is concerned and only two out of this number did not support the District Council's views."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of surprise to me. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that decentralisation schemes should be brought forward to 1 April 1996 instead of 1997, which is the present requirement. I accept that there have been representations to that effect. That would, however, accelerate by a year the administrative task undertaken by the shadow authorities and the new authorities. The shadow authorities will be set up in 1995 and the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that decentralisation schemes should be in place within a year. That is an unnecessary requirement, as it would impose an extra burden on the shadow authorities, which will have many other tasks to undertake. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am trying to answer a serious point, raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow. I do not know why there is such hilarity on the Opposition Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no hilarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A sensible acknowledgement of the practicalities of introducing decentralisation schemes would point to authorities being allowed the extra year to consult community councils and community groups, on which Opposition Members placed great emphasis in our long debate on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want any misunderstanding about this. It might be sensible and constructive if a Scottish Office official were to ring up Mr. John Howie, the chief executive in Kircudbright, to clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can certainly do that. We have had representations suggesting what the hon. Gentleman has proposed. I do not believe, however, that it would be sensible to add an extra burden to the shadow authorities in terms of their timetable. I would rather they took the extra year to consult fully with community councils and other groups and brought forward a proper and well-considered decentralisation scheme. That would be better than rushing through a scheme because of a greatly compressed timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been anxious not to include certain measures in the Bill, yet the Government's statutory right to give guidance is included. Why is it necessary to include that right in the Bill? What sort of guidance does he expect will be given? Surely a decentralisation measure should allow local authorities to make up their own mind—in a decentralised way—about decentralisation, rather than creating a statutory right to give them guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is meant by the words "take account of? If the local authority decides not to take account of the statutory guidance, what will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After a brief reference to the second, rather different point made by the hon. Member for Linhthgow perhaps I can then turn to the general point put to me by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), which takes us to the nub of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked me about the implications of the Rio conference and of environmental matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has complained about the time that is being taken to deal with the amendments. Could he not deal with the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow by writing one of his famous "Dear Tam" letters and letting us have it? Would not that be quicker than responding to it now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extraordinary suggestion. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that every time one of of his hon. Friends asks a perfectly legitimate question I should reply, "I cannot be bothered to answer that. I shall send the hon. Gentleman a letter"? I do not propose to take more than a minute to answer the point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee must calm down. It is not fair for an hon. Member to suggest that the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
should not reply to something that is said by another hon. Member in Committee. That is the point of debate in Committee. In any event the Committee should calm down. The background noise is not appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to answer, as best I could, the point raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is filibustering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Member complaining about? The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) explained his views on decentralisation at inordinate length on Tuesday. He went on and on. Of course he was in order—I am not complaining about that. His hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow asked me two straightforward questions which took him about 30 seconds. I would have answered them three or four minutes ago if the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley had not interfered from the sidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked me about local environment partnerships in relation to Rio. I am, of course, aware of the concerns of Friends of the Earth regarding such matters. I do not think that they are crucial to the decentralisation issue, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that if a local authority thought that it was sensible for environmental matters, such as local environmental partnerships, to be considered in the decentralised structure—and that might well be so—it could involve area committees, or another decentralised structure if it wanted to, in considering, specifically, Rio's implications for that local area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into the broader questions that the hon. Member for Linlithgow raised but I am happy to give him that assurance in answer to his specific question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Could we return to considering the amendments? I have heard nothing about the amendments, which would delete the guidance provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given every hon. Member in the Committee some leeway—including the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). I will decide when to bring the Minister to order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I have so far managed, because of the constant interruptions from Opposition Members, is to give way and answer questions that have been quite legitimately and properly put to me by the hon. Members for Linlithgow and for Angus, East. If the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley does not like that, he should stop his hon. Member for Linlithgow from asking me perfectly legitimate questions. I could then devote the three or four, minutes that I was proposing to take up to answer them to other issues. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley took so long to express his views to the Committee yet he now seems to wish to prevent everyone else from expressing their views on decentralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that, by my recollection, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley spoke for approximately 44 minutes at our previous sitting? We have therefore heard quite sufficient from him and he should give my hon. Friend adequate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want the hon. Gentleman or other members of the Committee to hark back to what happened on Tuesday. Today is Thursday and let us get on with what is before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member does not shout at me from a sedentary position every 20 seconds I will be able to get on with it. It is becoming increasingly clear that, irrespective of what they did on Tuesday, Opposition Members now want to delay proceedings as long as possible this morning by constantly interrupting me while I am trying to answer perfectly legitimate questions from the hon. Members for Linlithgow and Angus, East. I did not instruct them to ask me those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East, essentially asked, "Why guidance?" and "What will be in the guidance?". We have different types of decentralisation. The guidance will, essentially, represent best practice. That will be an important part of the guidance. The Scottish Office will collect examples of best practice and put them in guidance notes to local authorities after consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, in particular. It will be very much along the lines of our consultation on internal management. There is nothing to prevent others from issuing guidance too. For example COSLA could issue its own guidance to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can perhaps highlight three forms of decentralisation. First, there is political decentralisation, which involves the delegation of council decisions to committees. Some good examples of that already exist. I must not hark back to Tuesday, Mr. Martin, but I have already mentioned the Highlands planning and social work committees. Those examples may be further developed by the new councils to extend across the full range of local authority services. It is of course for the new councils themselves to decide what is right for them. I made the point before that what is appropriate in the Highlands authority might not necessarily be appropriate for Glasgow. What might be appropriate for Dumfries and Galloway might not necessarily be appropriate for Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second form that we shall look at is decentralisation at service delivery-managerial level. The principle here is that managerial and administrative decisions are made at the lowest possible level, which is as near to the customer as possible. The point has alreay been made that authorities will inherit much in the way of district offices and staff despersed through their areas. I look to the new authorities to develop those structures further. Many of the new authorities will start off their existence with decentralised service delivery and management structures already in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
The third form of decentralisation is the committees which we have already discussed. Where they are established they must have a clear role and function. As the hon. Member for Gasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) told us in a well considered speech earlier in our proceedings—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More, more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that will do the hon. Gentleman's career some good. Praise from Tory Ministers does not necessarily do Opposition Members much good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does in the new Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say that I had not quite heard what the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), in his splendid new green waistcoat, said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist my hon. Friend. I think he said that it does in the new Labour party. There is a wee story there somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look forward to pursuing those wee stories outside the Committee. They are not necessarily relevant to guidance on decentalisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not merely collecting the best practice and gathering it together and ferrying it out confirm my suspicion that this is once again a rush job which compares badly with the Paterson report? That report did the same for management structures and they were a perfect model that was followed more or less exactly by every council in Scotland. They were well thought through and agreed, through consensus, before any legislation was introduced. That has certainly not happened under the Bill. If the Minister is merely gathering together the collective wisdom of existing local authorities he could do so in the form of a note or a memorandum. Why must it be put in statute when many other matters that Opposition Members would like to see in statute are being deliberately left off by the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That relates precisely to the hon. Gentleman's first question about what "take account of means in practice. I shall come to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about area committees. As the hon. Member for Govan told the Committee, that type of decentralisation will require councils to take some fundamental decisions. The committees must be given a remit. It might include them being able to take local decisions in relation to a range of services. Perhaps a power to authorise expenditure up to a delegated level in relation to local road repairs, environmental improvements, community initiatives and perhaps grants to local organisations. The Government envisage that those are matters appropriate for guidance following discussions with local authority interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many good examples of decentralisation schemes which have been developed by councils and about which Opposition Members will doubtless be interested in hearing in some detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what bothers some of us. The Minister refers quite generously and accurately to the number of decentralisation schemes that exist. We know that from our experience in Lothian, so why on earth upset the apple cart? Is the proposed change worth a candle if those decentralisation schemes already exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am suggesting to the Committee, if I may be permitted to respond to the hon. Gentleman's perfectly reasonable questions and not be told by some Opposition Members that I should send him a letter on the point, is that the new authorities should build on the existing schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the sudden collective guilt complex of the Labour party about last Tuesday, could my hon. Friend say whether the difference seems to be summarised in the explanatory and financial memorandum to part V under the heading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Effect of the Bill on Public Service Manpower"?</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Hamilton quoted one sentence from it which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>Part I</i> will abolish one tier of local government resulting in an estimated reduction in local government staffing levels of between 700 and 2,200."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. It is a pity, that the hon. Member for Hamilton is not in his place in any event to hear my hon. Friend's comment. I am sure that he will read it in 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East made two points. He asked, in essence, why there should not be a further Paterson committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An equivalent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, all right. I shall not fall out with anyone over the splitting of such semantic hairs. The Paterson report is still of considerable validity and its recommendations are likely to be taken forward by the further activity of the internal management working group, which I mentioned earlier, which is likely, quite appropriately, to be led by COSLA. I assure the hon. Member for Angus, East that guidance on decentralisation will be fully discussed with the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question asked by the hon. Member for Angus, East was about the meaning of the words, "take account of". He asked, essentially, the purpose of their inclusion in the legislation as against the Secretary of State's simply being able to issue general guidance under general legislation. An authority is not required, in "taking account of" the guidance, to follow its every last detail—nor would the guidance suggest that. However, if an authority ignored the guidance completely—if it would accept none of the Secretary of State's guidance on
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
decentralisation schemes—the Secretary of State could use the powers under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 to take out a default order against the authority. That is a power of last resort. I should be most surprised if it were ever needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that decentralisation is a fake and a phoney. On the one hand he wants authorities to decentralise, and on the other he will not allow them the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the comments of the hon. Member for Angus, East are out of order if my comments were out of order. They are based on exactly the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) is reaching the stage at which he is criticising the Chair. He knows the rules of the House and of Committee as well as I do. The hon. Gentleman was—just to help him—reading something about finance in a memorandum on which I gave a ruling. It had nothing to do with the amendment. The hon. Gentleman should watch his conduct in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. You have said that I raised a point on finance. I ask you please to examine page ix of the explanatory and financial memorandum relating to part V. I was reading from the passage relating to the effects of the Bill on public service manpower, which was relevant—particularly the second sentence. If, as you say, Mr. Martin, I was talking about finance, I must have misread that passage. Please would you show me any reference to finance there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made comment about a memorandum that has nothing to do with the amendment. He mentioned financial effects, which have nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The Bill will set up statutory decentralisation schemes—and we would all agree that decentralisation is a good thing. The Minister, however, also foresees the possibility of centralised control over that decentralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I seek your guidance because I hope to contribute later in the debate. There are financial implications, because, in earlier debates, Opposition Members have discussed at great length the financial aspects of decentralisation. Would I be in order to refer to other parts of the Bill that directly relate to finance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me say to everyone that all hon. Members must speak to the amendments. My giving some leeway in discussing the amendments seems to be causing confusion. Therefore, I propose to stick firmly to the amendments. That might make it difficult for some hon. Members, but the only way for me to proceed is to stick firmly to the rules and give absolutely no leeway. That will stop any misunderstanding. The hon. Member for Angus, East is making an intervention, and I hope that he will be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Martin. I am sticking exactly to the important matter under discussion. The Government say that they want decentralisation schemes for local authorities. That purpose can now be seen as an absolute phoney because the Government will retain power to implement default orders. How can central Government propose decentralisation schemes in statute, yet in the same clause take away the right of decentralised local government to introduce those schemes? That is a paradox. The Government are not sincere about decentralisation because they can introduce default orders, which is ludicrous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman has got himself into a muddle. The Government want to encourage decentralisation schemes in all the new authorities. That is common ground in the Committee and is not in dispute. We acknowledge the good work that has been done in some authorities and we want to disseminate that good practice. We want all authorities to pay attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why we could not implement the provision under other legislation and why we wanted to put it in statute. The reasons are first, that the measure will have greater authority if it is in statute and secondly, there are final default powers if an authority pays no attention to the Secretary of State's guidance. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish those powers to be invoked. That is why it is appropriate to include the guidance in statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if local authorities decentralise in a manner of which the Government do not approve, the Government will introduce centralised default powers, or does he mean that the only way that the Government will introduce such powers is if local authorities do not decentralise? Which is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government can take out a default order in extreme circumstances when authorities completely ignore the guidance. If authorities say, "We have this guidance, but we are ignoring it".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should that happen, the Secretary of State can take out a default order to state that the authorities should take account of the Government's general guidance. That is not to impose a particular scheme of decentralisation on a local authority. Opposition Members argued that in the previous debate. That is precisely what the Government are not proposing. We do not want to lay down particular schemes of decentralisation. That is why the list in clause 23 contains examples of decentralisation, but is not exhaustive. I hope that that makes the hon. Member for Angus, East happier, but I see that it does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government would still be imposing their will on a system that they say they have decentralised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
Why should not a local authority, elected by local people, decide that it wants to decentralise in its own way? Why should central Government force their centralised guidance on that local authority? Let us have the decentralisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to help the hon. Gentleman, although I am not sure that that was wise. Default procedures are not new. As I said, they are provided for in the 1973 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that Members of Parliament regularly hear their constituents' views on council activities, including some connected with what may broadly be deemed decentralisation. It is because the Secretary of State has powers that hon. Members can go to him and get something done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Secretary of State has general default powers, which would apply in these circumstances. That is why the requirement to "take account of guidance" is appropriate. That phrase cannot possibly be interpreted as giving the Secretary of State any right to insist on any particular decentralisation scheme. It simply means that an authority must take account of—and be seen to take account of—the guidance in drawing up its decentralisation scheme. I think that that is clear. I hope that I have gone some way towards satisfying the hon. Member for Angus, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) suggested that this was a probing amendment. I have said that the guidance will take account of the points that were made in our previous debate. Therefore, I assume that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East will wish to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 179, in page 20, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(11) The provisions of section 15 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (Duty to allocate sets to political groups) shall not apply to committees established under subsection (2)(b) above.'.—	<i>[Mr. Connarty.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with the amendment. I am unable, technically, to accept it, for reasons that I will briefly outline. However, I hope to give the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, an assurance on this matter that will satisfy him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment for two reasons. First, clause 23(2)(b) provides an example of the sort of provisions that may be included in decentralisation schemes. It does not, however, create any new powers to establish committees. The powers flow from existing provisions in section 57 of the 1973 Act. To accept amendment No. 179 would create a category of committees—those established under subsection (2)(b)—which would not exist in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
Clause 23(2)(b) allows schemes to include provision as to the establishment of committees. It does not empower such establishment. The powers in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 are wide enough for area committees to be correctly identified and excluded from the scope of section 15 by way of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, section 15 has not yet been commenced in Scotland—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not know why the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley is looking at his watch. There are currently no firm plans for a commencement date. It might cause confusion to have commenced a provision in this measure that referred to another statutory provision which was not in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East will recognise that these are largely technical ojections to the purpose of the amendment, which is to disapply the rules on political balance to area committees. I hope that he will accept the technical reasons for not accepting the amendment. I can assure him that its purpose will be implemented through regulations. In other words, we will set out in regulations that the political balance requirements need not apply to area committees. I accept the point of the amendment, which is perfectly sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is extremely important and of enormous consequence to local government in Scotland. It will create a notional budget for local authorities to allow the Government the opportunity in 1996–97 of capping the budgets of new local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have an acknowledged problem because new local authorities will be created, but it is not known at the moment how many there will be. There has been a net addition of two local authorities since the Bill has been in Committee. Who knows how many will be created by the Government on Report or in the House of Lords?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) will not be able to participate, at least in public, because he has left the Committee Room, no doubt as part of a search party for the hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs). He was preceded by the Conservative Whip. I hesitate to suggest what might happen to the hon. Member for Swindon. He was in a lot of pain earlier in the week. I can only suggest that the pain will increase quickly and substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the fact that the hon. Member for Ayr and the Whip have left the Room might mean that the punishment will be even graver. The hon. Member for Swindon might be subjected to a speech by the hon. Member for Ayr. That would be grossly unfair to someone who has already suffered such pain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Scotland, including those in the constituency of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, are increasingly realising that the number of local authorities, which will be created on the whim of individual Conservatives and a Government who are totally out of control of their legislation, will have a dramatic effect on the cost of reorganisation and on the state of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ruled that we would not have a clause stand part debate. One of the reasons was that hon. Members are not keeping to the amendments. I ask everyone to keep to the amendments before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will keep to the amendments: I was discussing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of local authorities that will be involved is of enormous importance to the amendment, which would oblige the Government to make sure that consultation with local authorities is a prerequisite. The number of authorities that they will deal with is relevant and important. Given the notion of budgets that will be created under clause 24 and the way in which the timetable is established, the number of authorities will have a dramatic effect on the Government's figures. The number of councils is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the hon. Gentleman to speed things up if I tell him that I accept the principle behind the amendment, although I should need to examine the detailed wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. it shows that after a few minutes of argument from me the Government have caved in. That points up the relevance of my argument and the Government's sensitivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has hardly started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Who knows, by the end of this speech, the Government may concede even more. As you rightly said, Mr. Martin, two other amendments are linked to amendment No. 284. I hope that the Government's enlightened view will apply to them, too. On clause stand part, we may have more to say about the generality of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is serious. I do not intend to deal with it for long, but it has a fundamental effect on local authorities throughout Scotland. Members of the Committee know the importance of the clause. At a time when about 88 per cent. of local government funding comes from central Government in one way or another, whatever formula the Government establish will have a remarkable effect on the services that can be provided and on the tax that will be levied by councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of the notional budget, which is a wholly new concept, and all the problems resulting from it will have a long-term knock-on effect on local authority budgets, way beyond what people might think simply from reading clause 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25 relates to the financing of the new local authorities. The relationship between clause 24 and subsequent clauses is important and umbilical. If the Government get it wrong in clause 24 and in the notional budgets that they will invent for 1996–97, all subsequent years will be affected and local councils will bear the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capping provisions under discussion derive from section 94(2) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
Under, the powers given to the Secretary of State in that Act, he can seek a reduction in an authority's council tax level—if he considers that—its expenditure is excessive or—its increase in expenditure is excessive. The Government may well seek to make such a decision in 1996, if they are still in power at that time. In the normal course of events, it would involve two measurements. The first is a comparison of an authority's budget for the relevant year with its Government-aided expenditure for that year. The second is a comparison of the authority's budget for the relevant year with its budget for the preceding year. Plainly, there is no opportunity to do that in these circumstances because there will have been no similar authorities for the previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of the clause, the Government take upon themselves the power to invent budgets so that they can proceed with capping. On paper, such a provision may seem reasonable if new councils are to be created. However, in the hands of the Government—given how they treat local authorities and bearing in mind the capping powers—it has much more sinister implications, which I shall outline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is virtually impossible to imagine how the calculation will be fairly, properly and accurately made, especially in the time scale available. It is impossible to see how it can be done objectively. The disaggregation of expenditure that is presently being made by local authorities will be very complicated and the idea that by next year geniuses in the Scottish Office will have been able to establish the figures in detail is beyond my comprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The largest element of local authority expenditure is education. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the cost of running particular schools is unknown? If so, what does he think is the alternative to this proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The moment I mentioned geniuses, I knew that the hon. Member Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would jump to his feet. The point that he made may seem reasonable to him, but it is not if the task for the new local authorities in, for example, education is examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is not just a question of the number of schools; if it were, a calculation would be done and the matter would be simplicity itself. Education covers a number of areas which are connected with the other services that will have to be supplied by the new unitary authorities. Education in the hon. Gentleman's area is not confined to primary or to secondary schools; it involves the breakdown of teaching staff and the provision of special education. It is impossible easily or quickly to disaggregate them from the existing cost of authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefings that we have received suggest that there has been ongoing controversy about the lack of recognition of the higher unit costs of smaller schools in sparsely populated rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North doesn ot seem to be listening. Perhaps he is being supplied with another
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
ingenious question. He represents an area with sparse populations and small schools. There is already controversy about the higher unit costs that are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is not simply the number of secondary and primary schools for the old and the new authorities. If the rule of thumb were applied in such a way, the hon. Gentleman's constituency might be the one to suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall put my question to the hon. Gentleman. He obviously did not hear what I said. I was referring to individual schools. The cost of running them is known, whether they happen to be in one of my constituency's remote glens, or in Blairgowrie, which is more densely populated, or in the neighbouring constituencies of Dundee. The facts are known in round terms and something should be worked out from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the view of the experts. The hon. Gentleman, who has a huge range of expertise—from driving buses to piloting gliders—would not put himself in the category of a primary expert in local government finance or the complicated field of local authority education finance. He can be assured that the complications are not simply a matter of working out the costs of schools and transferring them from authority to authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? I want to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a break with tradition. I want to help the Committee. If the Conservate Whip allows it, the hon. Gentleman will be able to make his contribution later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Goverment's suggestion that they will accept our constructive amendment, but the problem with the Bill is that it does not provide for consultation with local authorities or a report to Parliament on how the details of the calculations are arrived at. That is one of the many deficiencies in the Government's approach to the notional budgets that will have to be created under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this takes the Committee back to this morning's points of order. In applying a year-on-year comparison to allow the notional budgets to be created, there will be a substantial effect on the local authorities because transitional costs have been included. That is the brunt of the matter: the Government are unreliable in their estimates of transitional costs. If they are right, it may be possible to arrive at a correct notional budget for local authorities. If they are wrong—we believe that they are, as does COSLA and every independent expert—an incorrect notional budget will be established in 1996–97, and that will have remarkable and damaging long-term consequences for local government in Scotland. That is why the transfer of undertakings provision is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's explanatory and financial memorandum is right and we are talking about a loss of staff in local authorities of between 700 and 2,000 people, we clearly have the basis of the Government's own calculation on transitional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week the Secretary of State for Scotland told the Association of Conservative Councillors conference:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of course there will be transitional costs. But by far the larger part of these costs will result from the rationalisation of staff."</p></blockquote>
The greater the short-term transitional costs, in other words the greater the reductions in staff, the greater the long-term savings from single tier councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The calculation on staff is fundamental to the way in which the Government calculate the cost of their reorganisation. That calculation is fundamental to the way in which that notional budget is to be paid for 1996–97. What was decided yesterday by the European Court of Justice has enormous importance. Despite the Minister's bluster earlier this morning, that judgment has dramatic consequences for the Government's costing figures and blows their calculations right out of the water. European law will come to the aid of these casualties of reorganisation in a way that this inhuman Government were incapable of doing. In doing so it will make a mockery of what the Secretary of State admitted, last weekend was his estimate of the transitional cost of local government reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government have now opened up a nightmare scenario? Every transfer of staff may end up in the Scottish courts. Because the Government failed to put the transfer in the Bill, the transition period will possibly coincide with a massive number of court cases throughout the Scottish courts. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a recipe for madness and utter chaos at the expense of valuable staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absoluately agree. While the Minister sits there muttering under his breath I am just about to prove that my hon. Friend is correct. I shall give chapter and verse on the legal basis of domestic law and its interpretation, which existed before yesterday's historic and landmark decision by the European Court of Justice. It is important to place on record that according to 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> Mr. Van Gerven, the Advocate General of the European Court
	<br><blockquote><p>"recommends that the Government, which has consistently refused to accept the application of the two directives, should therefore pay the entire costs of the case. No estimate of the cost is available but it is likely to run into millions."</p></blockquote>
We need only talk about the legal costs to realise that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very important in the context of the Bill that both Mr. Chris McLaughlin, the European correspondent of The Scotsman and Mr. Murray Ritchie, the European correspondent of the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> wrote stories this morning giving proper importance to the judgment, which some of the so-called national newspapers failed to do. They recognised the historic significance of that preliminary judgement. It simply confirms what we already knew.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from the legal manager of my own district council, Hamilton district council, Mr. Malcolm Moore, who studied in some detail how the Transfer of
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations related to local authorities and took senior counsel's opinion on the relationship of TUPE regulations to local government reorganisation in Scotland. His letter is backed by all the legal opinions which are highly authoritative. I am willing to give hon. Members, especially Conservative Members, copies of them. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Government's White Paper appeared in July 1993,1 obtained the Opinion of Senior Counsel on this whole point, and I have now since the Bill was published in December 1993, obtained a further Opinion from Senior Counsel on the Bill. Perhaps more importantly, I have only just now received another Opinion, this time from John McMullen who is one of England's leading experts on TUPE and the Directive.</p></blockquote>
The bottom line here is that both TUPE and more importantly the Directive will apply at local government re-organisation. The Government are clearly unaware that the Directive in particular will apply directly at local government re-organisation. As a result their proposed reduction in staffing levels arising from local government re-organisation will simply not happen, or it will not happen in the way the Government want it to happen."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the definitive view of a legal officer of a council, backed by the senior counsel that the council chose to advise it on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that my interest in European matters is as deep as his even though we approach them from different sides of the argument. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm one fundamental aspect of law—namely, that if the House does not change United Kingdom law on this matter, the directive has no meaning? It can be incorporated only when United Kingdom law is changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and I regularly sit in the House and on Committees on matters in which the law must be changed because of directives. If the United Kingdom Parliament does not pass laws, the directive will mean that people may be brought before the court and fined, but it cannot force the House to change the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that he and I used to share the arid deserts of European debates on the Floor of the House. I was listening to them, but he was not. The directive is part of British law. I remind the hon. Gentleman of the European Court of Justice ruling on the unwillingness of the British Government to obey directives that they had taken through the House of Commons. If any culpability lies in introducing the transfer of undertakings provisions, it lies with the Government. The hon. Gentleman may care to check that because he was probably in the Lobbies to vote for the transfer of undertakings provisions and for the directive. Despite his rebellious background on Maastricht, he should not pretend that he has automatic authority on European matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman makes comments, he should make sure that they are accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are. I presume that the hon. Gentleman is willing to participate in the debate and to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
argue with the Minister, who is obliged to defend the Government's position on the directive that they put through Parliament in 1985 or 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comment of Malcolm Moore, which were backed by senior counsel, have been confirmed by the European Court of Justice. In his article this morning, Chris McLaughlin was also clear of the judgement, he states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could also add millions to the cost of local government reform in Scotland, legislation for which is already in committee stage in the Commons. Under the ruling staff who would be made redundant or transferred to the new authorities would have to their conditions and salaries maintained."</p></blockquote>
The direct effect of today's judgment is related to the obligation on workers representation. That will lead to many cases about previous privatisations coming before domestic and European courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in deep financial water over previous privatisations. That will mean additional costs. The Government wander around pretending that they have never subscribed to those European laws. However, the interim judgment makes it clear that the Government are hopelessly wrong and that they will have to pay millions of pounds in costs for this case. They have been reprimanded by the European Court's Advocate General who said that Britain,
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been found to be in the wrong on all points in this case".</p></blockquote>
Yet the Minister wanders into Committee and says that this is all preposterous and ludicrous, and has no effect on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is designed to reduce the number of staff in local government. That reduction will make savings that the Government claim will justify a reorganisation that is not wanted, necessary or based on any independent review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Sir James Kilfedder 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I welcome you to that piece of furniture, Sir James. I am not allowed to say Chair.</p>
	<p>On behalf of those council taxpayers who will pick up the tab for this mess of a reorganisation—increased and exacerbated by the Government's humiliation in the European Court of Justice—we should be genuinely worried. In respect of clause 24, the Government will try to establish a pretend budget—one that is notional, invented and contrived—based on the same hamfisted view of affairs that has been apparent so far. That is a matter of grave concern to people throughout Scotland.</p>
	<p>The calculations that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central and I published yesterday show conclusively that people in Scotland will have to pay about £8 a week extra in council tax purely to pay for reorganising local government in Scotland. They will be paying an extra £10 a week as it is for the broken election promises in the Budget. No one now disputes that—even the Chancellor is quite happy to admit to that folly and deceit. The average council taxpayer in Scotland will then have to pay another £8 a week for this gerrymandering mess.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
	<p>The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South smiles. The bad news for his constituents is that that sum will be substantially higher for those in the upper council tax band areas in Aberdeen, South. If the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies look at the document that we have produced, they will find out that the impact on their constituents—especially the better-heeled ones—will be substantial. People in the Eastwood council area will pay up to £17 a week extra. People who are faced with the penalties of the Government's broken promises on tax will not willingly accept the new burden that will be imposed on them simply to satisfy Conservative gerrymandering ambitions. That is especially true of the hon. Gentleman's constituents.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituents want the Bill. They want a single-tier Aberdeen authority to be up and running as soon as possible, as does the hon. Gentleman's party.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to Aberdeen even sooner than that, but it will not be to apologise. It will be to accuse the hon. Gentleman and his hon.

The Tories will pick their pockets and simply throw the money away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South. If the hon. Member for Hamilton comes to the north-east he will find much stronger support than he imagines for local government reform. The people of the north-east are not taken in by newspaper articles in the 	<i>Evening Express</i> in Aberdeen in Labour party guise, scareing people into believing something that is based on unsubstantiated COSLA figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How interesting that the Aberdeen 	<i>Evening Express</i> is attacked in Committee for allegedly carrying Labour proaganda and for scaremongering and upsetting the honest citizens of Kincardine and Deeside, who, on the evidence of House of Commons Library calculations, will have to pay an extra £246 in council tax as a consequence of the reorganisation. I understand why the Whip is telling the hon. Gentleman not to ask me any more easy questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside, who has apparently been asked to leave the Room, so useful was his question to the Oppositoin—he has to sit down now, but I shall not mind him going when I have finished my answer—claims that we are scaremongering about the figures. The Opposition are supposed to be casting doubt on the Government's figures and using COSLA figures. Let me remind the hon. Gentleman, in case he did not listen to Monday night's debate in another forum in this buiding, of the words of the new chairman of the Association of Scottish Conservative Councillors, Councillor Jim Evans, the chairman of Berwickshire district council and a fully paid up Conservative, who said
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are a little bit more cynical than the government about these things,"</p></blockquote>
He was casting doubt on the Government's figures. That attitude is not just ours or COSLA's. It is adopted by Tories too, who say that they do not believe the bogus figures of the funny money men of Eastwood, who make their calculations on the back of very grimy old envelopes. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside should be wary about claiming that any people in his part of the world who realise what the measure will cost them will be in favour of reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman should contain himself or he, too, will be given a lecture by the Whip and be told to leave the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to consider the detailed consequences of clause 24. Considering the Government's figures on transitional costs has become quite an amusing activity. They would be hilarious if we could forget that we shall have to pay because of them if the Bill, by some misfortune, is passed. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside is so secure in his delusion about his constituency's council taxpayers, that he now leaves the Committee. He is about to give an exclusive apology to
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
	<i>The Press and Journal</i> of Aberdeen for his attack on its sister paper and to say that he did not really mean it and that he accepts the Labour figures about the effect of the measure on his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effects of clause 24 will not be funny. The creation of those notional budgets will not be funny in the short term. It will prove extremely serious. I am sad that the European expert for Tayside, North has left the Room, as I was about to give an example based on social work expenditure in Tayside, which is presently based on a major urban core with a large rural hinterland. We are told that the patterns of spending on social work in rural councils and in urban councils will be entirely different. After reorganisation, three new authorities will be created which will have no historic record of spending on social work services. As the debate continues, my hon. Friends will highlight many of the areas where such disaggregation will be particularly difficult and even disadvantageous to the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise the time scale. The Government are involved in an exercise of butchering Scottish councils that is taking place on an impossible timetable. Nowhere is that highlighted better than in the creation of notional budgets under clause 24. The brilliant statisticians and experts in the Scottish Office are among the only people in the world who understand the basis for calculating grant-aided expenditure. As the Minister rightly said, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was one of the small, select group of people who understood that, and so he could point out the flaws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those Scottish Office experts are wandering around in the dark, as are all the local authorities, wondering how the calculations under clause 24 can be made or embarked on. Not knowing the number, size and make-up of the councils, how can they arrive at an accurate definition that will stand the test of time in such an impossibly tight time scale?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be a problem for local authority finance teams and a headache for civil servants who advise the Minister, but it will not bother the Minister at all. Who will be affected? Who will be the casualties of those mistakes and hasty judgments? The people of Scotland will be affectd. The vulnerable people who rely on community care will be affected when there is no way of assessing the new community care needs of individual councils. Children in special needs education will be affected, because how will provision for that service be disaggregated from the existing structure to the hotch-potch of council boundaries that have not yet been finalised? People involved in public transprot and in economic planning and development will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, the casualties of this hasty, underthought and underplanned system of local government reorganisation will be elderly people, young people, people in training and in education and people who rely on concessionary fares and on nursery education. The creation of notional budgets under clause 24, on which capping powers will be determined, illustrates the Government's folly. If we had just one argument to deploy, I should point people to clause 24, to the impossibility of a timetable and the unnecessary process
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
that has led up to that timetable. That is folly and the whole Bill should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Following the powerful speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, you will recall that, long ago when a Lord-Advocate sat in the Commons, we often had a Law Officer's statement. I make no complaint that the current Lord-Advocate is not in the House of Commons, because I know it would be the same under a Labour Government. However, we can at least ask for a Law Officer's statement. Following the convincing comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, would it be possible to have a Law Officer's statement this afternoon about the Lord-Advocate's judgment on what my hon. Friend has said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is not a matter for the Chair. He has made his point and I know that the Minister will have heard every word he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must detain the Committee for a few moments because the hon. Member for Hamilton was not gracious enough to allow me to intervene for a second time. During his speech, he produced many unprincipled scare strories about costs and particularly referred to the costs in Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to challenge the hon. Gentleman to come to Aberdeen when the single-tier authority is up and running next April and debate publicly with me the costs of setting up that new single-tier authority, its functions and responsibilities and whether all the predictions that he has made for days and weeks in Committee have come to pass. Will he come to Aberdeen next April and debate publicly with me what has happened, not his spurious claims about what will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton gave way to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South and allowed him to intervene in his speech. I draw to the attention of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South that the new councils will not be up and running next April, as he says that they will. The shadow councils will come into being in April when the regional councils will still be functioning. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman therefore meant that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton should go to Aberdeen a year next April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with the Secretary of State's powers to cap not local authority expenditure, but local authority council tax. I understand that the Bill gives to the Secretary of State the powers to reduce the council tax and to base that reduction on the calculation of the comparison between the expenditure of the new councils in their first year of 1996–97 and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may slightly misunderstand the position. The capping powers refer to expenditure, not to the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, but I think that the Minister would accept that if expenditure is capped, the council tax is, effectively, capped. If councils are forced to
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
reduce their expenditure, the council tax will be reduced as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the comparison will be between the expenditure of the new authorities in 1996–97 and their imagined expenditure in 1995–96. As the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South does not seem to understand, the new authorities will not exist to deliver services in 1995–96. The Secretary of State will have the power to imagine the expenditure that councils might have incurred in that year if they had been in existence. The amendments are simple and would mean that before the Secretary of State imagines what those budgets might have been, he should consult the relevant authorities, provide a full and detailed explanation of the imagined budgets and produce separate reports for each authority, rather than lumping them together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he accepted the principle of amendment No. 284 and that, in principle, the Secretary of State would consult local authorities before he imagined what their budgets might have been in 1995–96. That is all very well, and welcome of course, but the Government have a long record of consulting local authorities about almost everything and then completely ignoring them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Member after hon. Member on the Conservative Benches has rubbished what COSLA told them about the transitional costs involved in the reform of local government. They listen to what local authorities have to say, but then completely ignore them. When I was a councillor in Tayside region during the 1983–87 Parliament, I remember receiving the Government's consultation document on the poll tax. Everyone told the Government that the poll tax was madness, that it could not be collected and that it would be a disaster. Did they listen? Of course not. They simply went ahead and did what they were going to do anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to accept the principle of amendment No. 284 without accepting the other two amendments. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he will listen to local authorities, but that does not mean that he will act on what they tell him. He will go ahead and do his own thing. He will not give a detailed explanation of how he is assessing their budgets, or provide separate orders for separate local authorities. He will do much as he likes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw it to the Committee's attention that there is likely to be a general election in 1996 or 1997. Conservative Members will be campaigning for re-election and trying to convince their contituents that a Conservative Government is good for them. One of their major arguments will be about profligate Labour councils in their constituencies. The Secretary of State for Scotland will try to label Labour councils as having indulged in excessive spending, which meant that their spending had to be capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly point out the activities of my local authority. I shall laud Kyle and Carrick district Conservative council and the great things that it will have achieved by election time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr is a lucky Tory Member of Parliament. He is one of the few in Scotland to have a Tory council. Most of them represent areas with Labour councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter will be politically contentious in 1996–97 and the Committee is giving the Secretary of State powers to cap local authority expenditure. Indeed, he will be able to imagine that spending might have been excessive, whether it was or not and irrespective of what might happen. Powers have been given to the Government that no democratic Parliament would ever give to any Executive. The Committee is considering giving such powers to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a statement of fact that I do not have even a Labour councillor in my constituency, let alone a Labour council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are not many Conservative Members of Parliament who represent Scottish constituencies, but there will be Conservative candidates in most areas of Scotland. In most areas of Scotland the authorities will be Labour controlled, Liberal controlled or controlled by Scottish National Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power that will be given to the Secretary of State will be used politically. That is why the amendment is essential. The Secretary of State would have to justify why he assesses an authority as having spent excessively—making a cap necessary—in detail in separate orders for each authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remember the political credit that the Government will gain. If a Tory Secretary of State for Scotland is able to say that a Labour authority has indulged in excessive expenditure, he will cap its expenditure and, as a result, council tax will be paid back to the well-heeled people who live in the area. Those well-heeled people are likely to think highly of that Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland and may consider voting for the Conservatives at the election. That is what the matter is about. It is not about scrutiny or proper control of public expenditure, but using the powers of the Secretary of State for party-political purposes, branding Labour authorities as excessive spenders, even when they have not spent in such a way. That can be done without the allegation having to be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other serious problem referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton was the comparison between the successor unitary authorities and the existing authorities. Regional councils, which spend 80 per cent. of expenditure in local government, benefit from huge economies of scale. As a result, they can keep the cost of council services down. That will not be possible under the new unitary authorities, which will be nothing like the size of the regional councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point about economies of scale. Such economies are, unfortunately, frequently lost because of the large number of personnel involved. A large part of local authority expenditure is wages and economies of scale are frequently lost because of the number of people required to achieve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I find it hard to follow the logic of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. He said that regional councils can make economies of scale, but because people are employed to achieve them they are lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, that is rubbish. I do not understand what point the hon. Gentleman was making. Either economies of scale can be achieved or they cannot. Regional councils can achieve such economies. That view is shared by most members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman failed to understand me. That is probably due to my inability to spell out what I was saying. I have experience of restructuring organisations with big purchasing powers. Often, those powers are lost because of the cost of employing people to achieve those powers. We are talking of the purchasing of goods and services, but it is largely in the purchase of goods where the economy of scale is achieved. Strathclyde has cited the example of photocopying machines, and so on. I do not argue with that. As I have found in other organisations, however, there is probably substantial evidence that the number of people employed to achieve such economies of scale means that those economies are lost, because, it is sad to say, wages form such a large part of local authority expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wages are a large part of local authority expenditure but those wages mainly go to people who provide direct services to the public—teachers, social workers and people who work on the roads. Such people achieve considerable savings for the Government if they work for the direct service organisations such as Tayside Contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Services cannot be provided without employing people. We debated that issue on the Floor of the House the other night and I pointed out to the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside that local government services are people: they are about employing people and about people delivering services. The kind of reductions to which the hon. Member for Tayside, North referred, with his wide business experience, cannot be made in this context. We are not talking about providing photocopiers or other retail products. We are talking about helping those who need help. The only way to do that is by using other people to provide that assistance. No great savings can be made in staffing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 10 to 15 years, local authorities have been subjected to horrendous pressure from central Government to cut their spending. That is reflected in the fact that we are debating capping powers and the Secretary of State's ability to limit what the authorities spend. They have cut to the bone in the employment of staff and there are no other savings to be made. I have strayed, however, from my point that the new unitary authorities will be unable to achieve the economies of scale that are currently possible under the regional councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that it will be impossible to achieve a notional capping level if every decision on groups of employees is made in the courts of Scotland? How can we plan for a transition period if court decisions and extra cost are piling up daily? The real issue is whether the Government will pay or whether, once again, the local authorities will be screwed to the wall by a Government who simply do not want to know about the folly of their own legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend is completely right. We are dealing with a looking glass world, not with the real world and the real costs to local authorities. We are dealing with what the Secretary of State imagines the costs will be. He has no way of knowing what those costs will be, especially if a series of court cases or industrial tribunals are heard on what the wages and conditions of employees of the new authorities should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us return to concrete examples in relation to economies of scale. The trading standards departments in Scotland are currently run by regional councils and gain considerable benefits from that. Those councils are big enough to employ professional officers with the required skills, at the appropriate salaries. Tayside region has a population base of about 400,000. It has a large revenue base and can afford to pay significant salaries. Will that be possible to the new unitary authorities? As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton said, if the TUPE regulations apply, the officers who transfer from Tayside to the new authorities will have to receive the same salaries, wages and conditions as Tayside currently pays. That will be a significant added cost to the new unitary authorities. Specialist officers are employed in the trading standards departments; they will have to be transferred to the three new authorities and new ones of equivalent professional ability will also have to be employed and paid the same kind of salaries as those currently paid by the regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trading standards departments must be of a sufficient size to be able to take on the big, major retailers that exercise their trade in Scotland. A small, insignificant trading standards department cannot stand up to such big retailers or corporations—in some cases, the oil companies that operate in Scotland. Those departments need to be of a sufficient size. Unless the new authorities incur massive expenditure in recreating huge trading standards departments within their areas we will be left with small, insignificant ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Trading Standards Administration consulted its clients in the best Government tradition. It asked what people thought should happen to trading standards offices. The CBI and large retailers responded that the offices should be retained in their present form because of the economies of scale available to the regional councils that run them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the new councils recreate big trading standards departments within their boundaries? Tayside will move from having one council responsible for that department to having three, and Strathclyde will move from one council being responsible to 20. Will those 20 different authorities all have their own trading standards
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
departments? Will they be able to provide 20 departments at the same cost as Strathclyde is able to provide one? I suspect that significant additional costs will arise as a result of that move, which will mean additional expenditure by the new unitary authorities. Will the Secretary of State take that into consideration when he looks at their budgets for 1995 and 1996 and make allowance for the fact that they will have to spend more to recreate departments such as those governing trading standards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem does not affect trading standards departments only. Social work services, education services and a range of other services are provided at a regional level. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton said, they will have to be disaggregated and provided by the new unitary authorities. That will involve significant costs. I hope that the Minister will make it clear that such increased expenditure will not be held against those authorities when he assesses their budgets for 1995 and 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In part, we have debated transitional costs and what they are likely to be for the new authorities. Conservatives Members have tried to rubbish COSLA's assessment of the level of transitional costs. However, COSLA is prepared to back its assessment with evidence. It is the Government who are not prepared to back with evidence their assessment of what the costs will be. I have a news release that was issued by COSLA on 1 March. Councillor Charles Gray, the president of COSLA and a man to whom the Minister listens carefully, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All of the Government's documentation regarding on-going savings of between £22 million and £66 million, off-setting transitional costs over two or three years, is sadly lacking in detail. Also we must know how much reliance the Secretary of State continues to place on the discredited six to eight week study carried out by Touche Ross."</p></blockquote>
If the Government go ahead and the transitional costs to the new unitary authorities are what they and the Touche Ross report think that they will be, they are being unrealistic. Those figures have been blasted out of the water by the COSLA. The COSLA report has to be taken far more seriously than the Government's advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Gray has written to the Minister with some questions. For example, he asks for the evidence for the Minister's claim.
	<br><blockquote><p>"that £40 million of savings will be made in the financial year starting April 1,1996."</p></blockquote>
Not one member of the Committee has heard any evidence that would substantiate that claim. The Minister should provide the evidence to substantiate his claim because that will be part of the calculation for the imagined budgets of the authorities in 1995 and 1996. He has assumed savings, but they will not make savings: they will face additional costs. The Minister must take account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Gray also asks about other Government claims, which are relevant to the amendments. He asks for details on the savings to be made on the costs for staff that the Government put at between £42 million and £83 million. Where will those savings come from? I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
know. Anyone who has listened to the Minister or who has read the Bill cannot see where the savings will come from. Only the Minister seems able to see that. He also manages to convince his hon. Friends to vote for him on these matters when they do not know what evidence there is to back up such claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other claims of savings have been made. The Government estimate that the shadow authorities will cost £23 million and that other transitional costs will come to between £30 million and £50 million. Where is the evidence for that claim? The COSLA report effectively undermines the Touche Ross report and completley discredits the figures that it contains. The Government must respond in detail to what COSLA has said about the Government's figures for the likely savings that will be made as a result of the transition to the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COSLA press release points out the significance of the transitional costs to the new authorities. It shows that there would be no on going savings as a result of local government reorganisation, and that transitional costs could range from £375 million to £720 million. COSLA has translated what those figures will mean for council tax payers. It estimates that there would be increases in council tax of between £230 and £440 for a band D property if the costs were met in one year. The increase would be between £60 to £100 a year if the costs were spread over five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know what the Secretary of State will do in 1996–97. He will lay down orders capping the expenditure of local authorities to force them to reduce those additional costs. He will not even have to justify his action. He simply needs to consult the local authorities, ignore what they say and then go ahead and cap their expenditure to force them to reduce their council tax levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that he has hit the key point in this debate? To control the madness that will be unleashed if the reorganisation takes place, the Secretary of State will have to cap every authority because the centralisation of expenditure levels will have to follow the mess that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point of amendment No. 199. The clause, as drafted, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A report under this section may relate to two or more authorities and may be amended by a subsequent report under this section."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would change the wording of that provision to read that a report
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall relate to one authority only."</p></blockquote>
The present wording means that the Secretary of State can bring in one order, which will be debated in Parliament in one and a half hours, capping every local authority in Scotland. He could do that in an election year to try to gain credit with the voters for reducing their council tax liability by capping local authority spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a capping exercise will have consequences. If they are forced to reduce their expenditure, councils will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
forced to lay off employees. The hon. Member for Tayside, North is right. If councils are forced to make swingeing cuts in their expenditure, local government employees will suffer and they are the people, in the main, who provide the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall use education as an example. The present formula for allocating rate support grant to local authorities to pay for education is based on a consultation document that was issued six or seven years ago by the then Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth). The document sets out pupil:teacher ratios, which still form the basis on which the Government allocate rate support grant to education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside region, for example, employs 250 teachers above the pupil:teacher ratio set out in the document. They are paid for mainly through council tax, because the council tax payers in Tayside want more teachers in the class room. They do not want composite classes; they do not want classes filled to the limit, with teachers put under pressure and discipline breaking down. They are prepared to see a higher pupil:teacher ratio in their area by paying additional council tax. When the Government assess the education expenditure of the successor authorities to Tayside regional council they will assume that the authority is spending exactly what is set out in the consultation document. They will assume that the area's pupil:teacher ratio is the one proposed in the document. They will not assume that additional teachers are employed. They will say that if the Dundee authority continues to employ the same number of teachers above the ratio allowed for, it will be deemed to be spending excessively. It will have to reduce its expenditure, reduce its council tax bills and, as a result, a number of teachers will have to be paid off. That will apply not only to Dundee, but to all the new successor authorities. That is a cause of great concern among people involved with education, who want the maximum number of teachers in school, not constant cut in their number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to hear from the Minister about the accumulated arrears of those who did not pay poll tax or council tax to existing authorities. When the regional and district councils cease to exist, what will happen to the arrears? Will they be transferred to the new authorities? Will the successor authorities be responsible for collecting council tax and poll tax owed to non-existent regional councils? If so, there will be a cost in chasing non-payers and getting the money back. Will that be allowed for in the Secretary of State's calculation when he examines the new authorities' spending? Certain authorities will have more non-payers than others and, therefore, will incur greater expenditure in chasing arrears. We want the Minister to explain that matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton makes a good point about the ruling in the European Court of Justice and the TUPE regulations applying to local authority employees who have to transfer to the new authorities.

	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
A number of questions about staff who will not transfer—people who the Secretary of State hopes will be made redundant as a result of the change to single-tier authorities—remain unanswered. We do not know what redundancy terms will apply. We do not know whether new posts will be ring-fenced or advertised exeternally. We do not know whether industrial tribunals will result from the current situation. Until such details are known, the costs cannot be known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been assumed throughout that some of the transitional costs that will be incurred in 1994–95 and in 1995–96, when shadow authorities will exist, will be met initially by the shadow councils or by the residuary body responsible. Thereafter, the proposed unitary councils will be charged in their first financial year, 1996–97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transitional costs will be carried by the new unitary authorities. The expenditure on those costs will be part of the calculation that the Secretary of State will make. Will transitional costs be disallowed? Will the liability for collecting poll tax and council tax arrears be disallowed and included in calculations of the new authorities' spending? Most of all, will existing staffing ratios in the education, social work and other service departments be maintained or will councils be expected to make significant reductions as part of the move to unitary authorities? If reductions are not made, will those councils be penalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East rightly drew attention to the highly pertinent questions of Councillor Gray. I ask that the Minister answers them seriatim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One by one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each one has to be answered. I am afraid that there will be more questions from me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question is does the Minister accept that, even if there is no reduction in employee numbers following reorganisation, a large number of employees could become redundant due to a major change in the location, status or remuneration of their employment or becuase of a mismatch of skills? If so, how has that been taken into account in the estimate of transitional costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question-is how many staff are likely to be relocated and how has the cost of acquiring and adapting the necessary accommodation been calculated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question is will the Secretary of State undertake to ensure that the necessary capital consents will be made available to permit the early location of all staff in suitable accommodation in the areas of their authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question is how much reliance was placed upon the results of the Touche Ross study in arriving at the figures set out in the financial memorandum to the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth question is what was the cost of the Touche Ross study carried out by the Scottish Office in relation to
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
identifying the costs of reorganising local government in Scotland and how many man or woman weeks of professional input was charged for by Touche Ross?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sixth question is will the Secretary of State provide to the Committee a copy of any submission which supports the level of the overall ongoing savings and transitional costs set out within the financial memorandum to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seventhly, one of the main arguments used by the Government to suggest that there will be cost savings under a unitary authority structure is to quote on numerous occasions that instead of there being 65 councils as at present, there will be a unitary structure of 28 authorities, now 30 and increasing. The basic assumption underlying that answer is that a reduction in the number will automatically bring about savings. However, the real truth is that the nine mainland regional councils incur by far the highest level of expenditure and provide almost 80 per cent. of the services of local government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must therefore ask what is the present level of net expenditure incurred by the nine mainland regional councils expressed as a percentage of the total net expenditure of the present 53 mainland authorities? What is the planned number of mainland authorities that will be established in the future to carry out the functions presently performed by the nine regional authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question is number—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman rarely reads a speech in the House or in Committee but there is a rule against reading page after page. I would like to know how many questions are on the paper because some of them are not relevant to the amendments. He should restrict his questions to the amendments to clause 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be delighted to know, Sir James, as will my colleagues, that I have come to the penultimate question. It relates to another aspect raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. Will the Secretary of State provide full details and documentary evidence, on an area-by-area and service function basis, supporting his assertion that ongoing savings of between £22 million and £66 million will arise from his proposals and that £40 million of savings will be made in the financial year commencing 1 April 1996?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with two crucial points. The assessments are largely based on what it costs to provide a standard level of service. For some services the assessments are based on patterns of spending. The amount that councils have spent on those services in the past will in large part determine what the grant-aided expenditure will be for their services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end with the reflection that all I have listened to this morning and in previous sittings gives me the impression that in the whole issue of disaggregation that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton rightly concentrated upon, not much attention has been paid to the disaggregation of services. The Government have certainly paid attention to the disaggregation of administration and headquarters costs, but what attention has been paid to the very real costs of the disaggregation of services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These three amendments bring us to one of the crucial issues in the whole Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton pointed out. As I understand it, one of the rationales of this whole unwanted, uncalled for and unnecessary exercise is that, according to the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State, there will be some financial savings. That is one of the Minister's main planks for reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to catch your eye again, Sir James, when we reach clause 25 which deals with the transitional provisions for the financial year to 1 April 1996. These amendments relate to the financial year 1996–97 when there will be two lots of expenditure. One will be the expenditure for running the authorities, the normal service expenditure, and the other will be a substantial element of transitional expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our contention is that the Minister, even in his original proposals, but certainly as he goes on week by week adding new authorities, greatly overestimates the long-term savings and greatly underestimates the short-term transitional provisions. I want to stress one point in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to what I was saying earlier about the European Court' of Justice preliminary judgment, it is remarkably that the Government say, and the Minister presumably will say, in their defence that they will absolutely adhere to the acquired rights directive and to TUPE, and that all staff will be transferred to the new authorities. It will then be up to the new authorities to dismiss them, which the Government argue will not be in conflict with European law. Can I suggest to my hon. Friend that every time the Government have tried to dodge the acquired rights directive the TUPE they have been humiliated. Yesterday's prelimiary judgment was a consequence of their attempts at that stage to dodge their responsibilities. It is a humiliation to the Government, and it will cost British taxpayers millions of pounds in court costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing at a time. My hon. Friend was a distinguished organiser for the General Municipal and Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union. I think that officially he is still on loan to us from the GMB, fortunately, at no cost. If anything dreadful happened to him electorally it would take him back on board. As a serving trade union officer, albeit on a sabbatical, his assessment is absolutely right. He knows more than any member of the Committee. I am merely an ex-councillor. I see things simply in terms of local authority expenditure and service. I bow to my hon. Friend on this matter, and I give way to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are obviously talking about redundancies. Could the hon. Gentleman make a more accurate forecast of the political demise of the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
Member for Hamilton? When does he expect the sabbatical to end?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being too optimistic. The sabbatical will last for as long as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member for Tayside, North is anxious to get in. I am glad to see him on this Committee and in the rudest of rude health and back to his old ways. I am happy to give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. In the time that he and I have been in the House he has always been courteous, and I acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to part of the preamble to the Bill, which states that precise staffing levels
	<br><blockquote><p>"will depend on decisions taken by the new councils."</p></blockquote>
In effect that has already been established and it is all that the Committee is concerned with. I make my remarks as someone who has been involved in industrial relations. There are always two sides to any argument on industrial relations and the trade union official does not always win.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Tayside, North for his advice. As I recall, he was on the other side in those industrial negotiations, as a personnel manager and subsequently as a managing director—quite successfully, I believe. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton looks concerned. I want to return to the subject of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another hon. Member wants to tell us about his credentials in such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to point out to the hon. Gentleman that there is a pretence that the explanatory and financial memorandum puts the onus with regard to extra expense on the new local authorities, when the truth, as we have been hearing, is that more and more of that expense derives from central Government decisions. It is time that we again concentrated on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Central Government places burdens on local authorities and then chides and chastises them for becoming involved in expenditure to carry those burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return, and stick closely, to the amendments. Amendment No. 284 uses the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"following consulations with local authorities".</p></blockquote>
The report on 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton referred, states
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Scotland's Tory Councillors"—not Labour, SNP, Liberal Demoncrate or even independent—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"yesterday sent a warning to Scottish Scretary Ian Lang that he has badly underestimated the price to be paid for the reorganisation of local government."</p></blockquote>
That is simple, stark, straight to the point and absolutely right. Those councillors know about local government. They are involved in it at the cutting edge. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is nodding—he agrees with me. The councillors are the people who understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that you, Sir James, are probably not a regular reader of 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> and I want to mention that the article also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lang told a gathering of Conservative women from the west of Scotland"</p></blockquote>
his views. That could have been a very interesting gathering,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a big one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian says, it wa sprobably not a very large one. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> And, as my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East said, it was probably an aging group—but none the worse for it, I should quickly add, considering my Age Concern credentials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State and the Minister continue to consult local authorities they will receive comments similar to those that the Conservative women in the west of Scotland made to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example can show how flawed the report, is on which the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office base their caluclations. You know, Sir James, and we have heard it again and again, that the Secretary of State, the Minsiter and the Scottish Office treat the Touche Ross report as the bedrock of their calculations. If we can show that that bedrock is seriously flawed, we can show that the basis of the Government's calculation is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the report forms a basis, but also that many of the comments made the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister about financing have been based on information gathered by local authorities and submitted to my hon. Friend the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, quite the reverse is true. The Secretary of State has dismissed the authoritative COSLA report, which is based on the best information from local authorities. He has dismissed the reports from Strathclyde, Lothian, Tayside and Central, which are responsible for running the major services in Scotland that will be transferred to the new authorities. He has taken account of the partisan suggestions of individual district councils only, such as Kyle and Carrick, which seek separate status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State dismissed the COSLA costings. However, it was not my right hon. Friend, but the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) who did that. When he was shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Monklands, West
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
said on "Crossfire "on Grampian Television that the cost of local government reform would be precisely £126 million. Why should we believe this shadow Secretary of State and not the previous one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about my hon. Friend when he was shadow Secretary of State. As more information has become available about the meaning of local government reorganisation, more detailed calculations have been made. On Tuesday I had a discussion with Archie Gillespie, the finance director of Strathclyde region, and I have much more up-to-date detailed information than was available to my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Touche Ross report is flawed and can be demolished easily. On 3 February I questioned the reliability of the Touche Ross estimates and used the particular example of libraries. My hon. Friends thought that that was a good example, and I know that Conservative Members have a particular interest in the library service. The Minister did not respond to my point about the miscalculation regarding libraries. I can understand why, but it is not good enough for him not to respond. I challenge him now to respond to the point about those figures, which undermines the whole Touche Ross report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the table facing page 9 of the Touche Ross report estimates are given for the savings and costs of each local government service for the four possible numbers of local authorities then being considered, from 15 to 51. In the case of libraries, the report said that having 51 authorities could produce savings of 34.8 per cent. That astonished me, my hon. Friends and even some Conservative Members because the number of authorities that currently have library functions is 40. Therefore, if the number of authorities with library functions is increased from 40 to 51 how does that save money? The hon. Member for Tayside, North, who is practical, sensible and down-to-earth, must realise that if we start with 40 and move to 51 we cannot save one third of the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment the three regions, the three island councils and, elsewhere, the district councils have those library functions. Members of the Committee must have wondered how the costs could be cut. The Minister did not give an explanation, so I shall. Touche Ross made the erroneous assumption that all the present 65 authorities have library functions. It was wrong. It thought that the number was going down from 65 to 51, when in reality it was going up from 40 to 51. The Minister cannot deny that—I shall give him the opportunity to intervene if he wishes to deny it. I hope that he will realise that what I am saying is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Touche Ross could make such a mistake with its figures for libraries, have not they made mistakes for many other services? I understand that Touche Ross has admitted to the Scottish Office, the Minister and the Government that it made a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
